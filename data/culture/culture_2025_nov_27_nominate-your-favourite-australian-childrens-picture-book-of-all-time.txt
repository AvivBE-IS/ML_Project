Nominate your favourite Australian children’s picture book of all time
------------------------------------------------------------
The best children’s picture books can be pure magic for adults, too: witty and wise prose or poetry that is a joy to read aloud, coupled with vivid, evocative illustrations that live on in the memory – and the culture – for decades. Australia has produced more than its fair share of classics, from the effortlessly educational to the cheekily irreverent, and we want you to nominate your favourite for a major reader’s poll we will run in late January: the best Australian children’s picture book of all time. To be eligible a book must be: Primarily intended to be read aloud to children who don’t yet read independently; Able to be read in a few minutes – we’re looking for a child’s picture book, rather than a graphic novel or illustrated chapter book; Written by an Australian (or someone we’ve claimed); Published in Australia. If the respondent is under 18, a parent or guardian must complete the form on their behalf. If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read terms of service here and privacy policy here. This callout has now closed. If you are 18 years or over, you can get in touch by filling in the form above. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions .We will keep the names of individuals anonymous if you wish and won’t use any of your experiences without getting your permission beforehand. We will delete any personal data when we no longer require it for this purpose. For more information please read our privacy policy.
