Hong Kong apartment fires: have you been affected?
------------------------------------------------------------
146 people are known to have died, in last week’s devastating fire at an apartment complex in Hong Kong, with about 200 still unaccounted for. Authorities have arrested 13 people on suspicion of manslaughter related to the fire amid growing criticism from residents about arrests under national security laws of at least two civilians calling for accountability. The Wang Fuk Court complex, home to almost 5,000 people, had been undergoing extensive renovations that have been linked to the fire’s cause. In the aftermath, the city has been racked with anger over alleged past safety violations by the construction company working at the site and lax enforcement of standards. Many people have placed bouquets of flowers at a makeshift memorial at the scene of the disaster, among the worst in the city’s history.
