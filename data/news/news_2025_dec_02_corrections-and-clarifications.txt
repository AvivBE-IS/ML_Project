Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• The tech company Nvidia is worth about $4.3tn, not $3.4tn (The inside story of the race to build the ultimate in artificial intelligence, 1 December, p10 from p1). • The Intercity train from the Italian mainland to Sicily is not “lifted from its tracks” to be loaded on to the ferry at Villa San Giovanni; it stays on rail tracks, which continue on deck (Sicily is in dire straits. A bridge won’t fix that, 14 November, Journal, p4). • Other recently amended articles include: Australian taxpayers subsidise rising specialist fees as spending on Abbott-era Medicare safety net ‘explodes’ Division and derision: how plans for an AFL stadium left Tasmania in pieces Sugababes, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Wolf Alice and more to play all-star charity concert for trans rights Move over, Murdoch: will Lord Rothermere be Britain’s most powerful media mogul? Frozen-in tenor: Italian mayor apologises over Pavarotti statue stuck in ice rink Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
