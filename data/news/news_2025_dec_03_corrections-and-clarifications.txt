Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• Cryptic crossword No 29,868 erred in its wordplay for 12 across. If you replace “nevertheless catches” in the clue with “by chance catching” you will get the correct collection of vowels (3 December, Journal, p8). • An article should have referred to Robert F Kennedy Jr throughout, rather than Robert F Kennedy, his late father (America, you don’t know how to write about a sex scandal, 26 November, Journal, p3). • Other recently amended articles include: David Lammy expected to water down plans to scrap most jury trials Several protesters arrested after ICE raid thwarted in New York City Ban on Palestine Action is repugnant and should be lifted, high court told UK and Europe’s hidden landfills at risk of leaking toxic waste into water supplies The 20 best songs of 2025 Toto carrying the rings at Albanese’s wedding is nothing new, as more pets join couples saying ‘I do’ Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
