Corrections and clarifications 
------------------------------------------------------------
• An obituary of Sir Tom Stoppard said his four grandparents and several relatives of his parents’ generation “died in the death camp at Terezín”. His relatives were transported to Terezín in German-occupied Czechoslovakia, which was a transit camp and ghetto rather than a death camp. In fact, his paternal grandparents died at the Riga ghetto in Latvia and his maternal grandparents at Auschwitz. Also, his play The Hard Problem was first produced in 2015, not 2006 (1 December, Journal, p6). • Other recently amended articles include: Trump’s night of 160 posts on Truth Social fuels debate about US president’s stamina Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
