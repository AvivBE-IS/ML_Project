Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• An article on peace talks (Can Europe unite to tame Russia without Trump’s help?, 29 November, p36) incorrectly said that Donald Trump was planning a second summit with Vladimir Putin in Bucharest. This should have said Budapest. • Cariad Lloyd’s co-host on the Weirdos Book Club podcast is Sara Pascoe, not Rachel Parris (Flashback, 29 November, Saturday magazine, p8). This error was in print only. • Our obituary of the musician Gary “Mani” Mounfield said that the single Fools Gold was included on the original release of the Stone Roses’ debut album. It was in fact a standalone hit (22 November, Journal, p8). • Other recently amended articles include: Record numbers becoming billionaires through inheritance, UBS report finds Swiss gold and Rolex gifts to Trump arouse ‘disgust’ in Europe ‘Sexy and a little daring, but never too much’: sheer skirts hit the sweet spot Steve Cropper, legendary guitarist for Booker T &amp; the MGs, dies aged 84 No EVs road-tested in Australia live up to claimed range on a single charge – but one brand came close Wes Streeting orders review of mental health diagnoses as benefit claims soar Is your relationship solid – or sinking? The bird theory thinks it knows Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
