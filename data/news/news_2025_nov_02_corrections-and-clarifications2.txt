Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• A leader column (Train travel, 27 September, Journal, p2) described Robert Stephenson and Co’s Locomotion No 1, which arrived in Stockton on 27 September 1825, as “the first rail vehicle ever to transport passengers”. This should more accurately have said it was the first steam train to carry passengers on a public railway. • Malapropism corner: “3-4 tbsp slithered almonds” (Mushroom linguine with ancho and chard, 11 October, Feast, p5). Print version only. • Other recently amended articles include: Fed cuts interest rates for second time this year amid economic uncertainty How deprived is your area? Look up your postcode as new data for England released The least frightening films ever – ranked! Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
