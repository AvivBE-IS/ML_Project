Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• We said an analysis of Office for National Statistics figures showed suicide rates among young people aged 15 to 25 in England rose by more than half in a decade. However, the ONS has advised us that its figures, compiled to study deaths among young people across academic years, should not be used to infer suicide rates in the general population in this way; in statistical terms the numbers of suicide deaths in the overall cohort are low, making confidence intervals wide. Also, a change in 2018 in the standard of proof used by coroners for suicide registrations affects the comparability of rates across time (Suicide rates in the young rise by 50% in a decade, 21 October, p19). The article has been removed from our website. • Other recently amended articles include: Stephen King’s son among writers boycotting British Library event in solidarity with striking workers Big trouble in ‘Little Berlin’: the tiny hamlet split in two by the cold war Reform councillor defects to Tories after party’s policies left him ‘uncomfortable’ Gumnuts, baby!
