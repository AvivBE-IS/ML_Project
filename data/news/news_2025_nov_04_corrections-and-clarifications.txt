Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• An article about Richard Taylor’s libel case against the makers of The Lost King (Coogan to pay ‘substantial damages’ to academic portrayed in Richard III film, 28 October, p9) incorrectly described his role of deputy registrar at the University of Leicester as academic; it is administrative. • An obituary of Lord Taverne said his mother, Louise, was Anglo-Dutch; in fact, his parents were both Dutch. The picture of Taverne walking on a beach with three others showed members of the SDP-Liberal alliance, not just the SDP as the caption stated. Also, his US debating tour with William Rees-Mogg in 1951 did not include Jeremy Thorpe or Robin Day (27 October, Journal, p6). • Other recently amended articles include: Top 10 US billionaires’ collective wealth grew by $698bn in past year – report Brief Encounter at 80: why we’re still falling for David Lean’s 1945 romance Trump policies spur economic anxiety in US Republican heartland: ‘Tariffs are affecting everything’ Britain one of least ‘nature-connected’ nations in world – with Nepal the most Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc review – gore-soaked demonic anime squats in the manosphere Girlbands Forever: this shocking history of 90s female pop is packed with gossip, scandal – and bangers NHS hospitals to test AI tool that helps diagnose and treat prostate cancer ‘The money machine is misfiring’: City blames Brexit for UK’s £20bn productivity headache Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
