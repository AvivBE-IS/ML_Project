Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• An opinion article (Silence over Sudan shows the power of sportswashing, 8 November, Sport, p4) stated incorrectly that the comedian Frankie Boyle had performed at an event in Dubai this year; he did not, and we are advised by his representatives that he has not performed in Dubai for more than 25 years. We apologise to Mr Boyle for this error and any suggestion of hypocrisy or double standards on his part. • Other recently amended articles include: Senate advances funding bill to end longest-ever US government shutdown US to cut airline traffic by 10% at 40 airports amid shutdown, Trump transport chief says Eight dead and more than a million displaced after super typhoon Fung-wong slams the Philippines Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
