Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• Information provided to the Guardian led an article and its headline (Palestinian teenager and nurse among dozens in underground Israeli jail, 8 November, p28) to say the referenced teenager was still in custody. The Israeli NGO representing him and the nurse has since informed us that the teenager was released on 13 October under the ceasefire agreement, after nine months in detention at the Rakefet complex. • Other recently amended articles include: Man and daughter flying hurricane relief supplies to Jamaica identified as victims of crash Charging an electric car at home: what kit do you need and what is the cost? TikTok influencer killed in public ‘execution’ as Mali’s jihadist crisis worsens Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
