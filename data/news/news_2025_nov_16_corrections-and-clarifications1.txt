Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• Owing to errors in information supplied, an article said the Campaign to Protect Rural England had calculated that 1.49m homes could be built on brownfield sites, of which 790,000 already had planning permission. The corrected figures are 1.41m and 770,000 respectively (England has enough brownfield land for 1.5m homes, data shows, 24 September, p17). Also, there are 27,200 brownfield sites available across 29,977 hectares, not 30,257 sites covering 32,884 hectares. A chart in the article’s online version was also affected and has been updated to give the correct numbers for London, the south-east and north-west. • Other recently amended articles include: ‘Trumpist’ Czech PM-elect refuses to sell business empire amid conflict-of-interest row Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
