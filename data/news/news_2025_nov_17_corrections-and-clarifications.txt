Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• Catherine Connolly spoke of the Irish people’s experience of forced emigration, not “forced immigration” (New Irish president promises ‘a republic worthy of its name’, 12 November, p27). • Georgia Gould was a Cabinet Office minister, not a cabinet minister, when she launched a crackdown on child benefit fraud in August (Families criticise the cost of fixing errors over child benefit, 31 October, p14). • Other recently amended articles include: ‘Two more broomsticks please!’ Was James Blades the greatest percussionist ever? ‘I think the city is falling apart’: Leicester braces for a make-or-break budget ‘It’s been a cesspit, really, my life’: war photographer Don McCullin on 19 of his greatest pictures Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
