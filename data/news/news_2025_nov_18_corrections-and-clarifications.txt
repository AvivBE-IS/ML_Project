• An opinion article about cities said: “According to the Office for National Statistics, knife crime in London rose by only 1% in the last year, compared with 19% in Dorset, 31% in North Yorkshire and 51% in Suffolk.” These figures were obtained from an undated graph. The latest ONS figures show a 0% change over the last year for these locations, except Dorset where knife crime fell 13% (No-go cesspits?
