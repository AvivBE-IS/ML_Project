Easterly winds and clear skies are cue for charismatic waxwings to cross to UK
------------------------------------------------------------
By November in the UK, autumn bird migration is more or less over. Our summer visitors, such as warblers, chats and flycatchers, are far to the south in Africa. Meanwhile, many winter visitors – mostly waders and wildfowl – have arrived from their breeding grounds to the north and east. Nevertheless, as the British Trust for Ornithology’s regular Migration Blog reports, there are still plenty of birds on the move, with specific weather conditions either holding them back or boosting their travels. Waxwings are a much sought-after arrival, and this autumn looks good with high numbers in southern Scandinavia. Should we get easterly winds and clear skies, these charismatic birds could cross the North Sea and turn up along our east coast, often gathering in noisy flocks in supermarket car parks where they feast on berries. Woodcocks also travel here from Scandinavia on clear nights, their numbers peaking in November. However, these secretive, woodland-dwelling waders are far harder to see. The BTO’s experts also suggest we look out for movements of wood pigeons – not a species we usually associate with migration, yet which often move in large flocks. Late last month an astonishing 231,000 wood pigeons were observed heading south-west over the village of Portskewett in Gwent. It is thought that at least some of these birds will cross the Channel to overwinter in continental Europe before returning next spring to breed.
