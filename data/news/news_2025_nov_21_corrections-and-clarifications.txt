Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• A review of Lilibet’s in Mayfair (‘My new favourite restaurant’, 8 November, Feast, p22) suggested Punk Royale was a Danish restaurant chain; while it has a restaurant in Copenhagen, Punk Royale was founded in Stockholm. • The Palazzo Previtera, a hotel and museum in Sicily that we listed in a travel feature on historic places to stay, was built in 1649 and is therefore not “medieval” as the subheading described it (From the Tudors to the Spice Girls: 10 places to stay where you can live in the past, 15 November, Saturday magazine, p74). • Other recently amended articles include: Paramount to show most Champions League games in UK from 2027-31 Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
