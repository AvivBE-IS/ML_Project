Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• Compensation for those affected by the carer’s allowance scandal was considered by the Sayce review, but did not form one of its published recommendations as we said (Victory for carers after inquiry into debt scandal, 25 November, p1, early editions; Timeline, p13). • We neglected to check the answer for Monday’s Word wheel in yesterday’s G2 (p12). The correct solution was “nightlife”, not “attenuate”. • Other recently amended articles include: Civilisations: Rise and Fall review – TV that will make you despair for our own plummeting society Labour must back delivery drivers sacked by DPD, former cabinet minister says Serbian president faces legal complaint in Sarajevo ‘sniper-tourism’ case ‘Shock’ loophole in NSW law meant to protect children against incarceration could mean more will be locked up ‘An inner duty’: the 35-year quest to bring Bach’s lost organ works to light The 2025 BirdLife Australia photography awards – in pictures Ukrainian refugee Danylo Yavhusishyn wows Japan to win his country’s first elite sumo title Americans are feeling the pain of the affordability crisis: ‘There’s not any wiggle room’ Climate of fear: are CSIRO’s sweeping job cuts a sign Australia doesn’t care about the extinction crisis? ‘Do you expect me to talk?’: Dick Van Dyke says he turned down playing James Bond Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
