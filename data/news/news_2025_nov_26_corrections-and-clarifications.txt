Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• It was Israeli airstrikes that killed more than a reported 1,000 Iranians in June, not US strikes as an article said (Iran’s fragile charm offensive amid regional tensions, 25 November, p22). The US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities reported no casualties. • An article (Agency staff to join Birmingham bin strike after alleged bullying, 18 November, p11) referred to “agency staff brought in as cover during the long-running bin strikes”. In fact the agency staff were already working for Birmingham council. • Other recently amended articles include: British woman among five tourists killed in blizzard at nature reserve in Chile The long and winding road: Stuart Maconie on why our opinions about the Beatles keep changing ‘An idealized version of LA’: fabled mid-century Stahl house on sale for first time Horror stories of a ‘feminised workplace’ mask the real crisis in male identity ‘Stone-cold killers’: New Zealand to eradicate feral cats by 2050 ‘Taking back the desert’: can Australia’s small marsupials learn how to live alongside their predator, the feral cat? ‘We must protect and we must understand’: using shipwrecks to rebuild fish populations Do women’s periods actually sync up with each other?
