• An article (Jury trials to be scrapped for all but the most serious offences, 26 November, p1) did not make clear in early editions that the record backlog of crown court cases (78,000), and the government’s proposed remedy, referred to England and Wales only. Criminal justice is devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland. • Other recently amended articles include: ‘Zero regrets’: Tom Heaton on life at Manchester United after 1,029 days without a game Plan to speed tanks and armies across Europe in case of war with Russia Cases against Comey and James tossed, Pentagon investigating US senator and Turning Point USA looks to 2028 – as it happened Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
