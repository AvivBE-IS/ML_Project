Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• Ronni Ancona studied at Central Saint Martins, and then University College London, not at Edinburgh College of Art. Also the Big Impression sketch show ran until 2004, not 2003 as we said owing to an editing error (Flashback, 15 November, Saturday magazine, p8). • Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was not a producer of Prisoner 951, the BBC drama based on her and her husband’s book, contrary to what our preview said (22 November, What’s on, p4). • Chris Foggin’s film This Is Christmas was released in 2022, not last year as we said in a feature in tomorrow’s pre-printed What’s on section (‘My classic Yorkshire line was “hiya luv!”’, 29 November, p2). This error was in print only. • Other recently amended articles include: ‘It was no longer a gift for my husband. It was all for me’: four women on how boudoir photography changed their lives The best Christmas gifts for swimmers in the UK, from swim socks to snorkels Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
