Corrections and clarifications

• A review of Cameron Crowe’s memoir The Uncool in today’s pre‑printed Saturday magazine said that Crowe wrote and directed the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High (Access all areas, p51). In fact, Amy Heckerling was the director. • An article (Does loyalty really pay when it comes to a weekly shop?, 11 October, p42) misstated details of the Co-op’s loyalty scheme. The £1 fee is one-off, not annual, and can be claimed back from your first shop. While members can select two personalised offers each week, there are more than two to choose from. • Vienna is not the only European capital in which wine is produced, but it does produce the most (Six of the best, 4 October, Saturday magazine, p78). • Other recently amended articles include: Trinidad citizens believed killed in US airstrike off Venezuela coast identified British woman on death row in Bali for drug smuggling to be repatriated Artist sues for co-author credit on Chris Levine’s queen portraits Last candidate to chair grooming gangs inquiry withdraws over ‘lack of trust’ Catherine Connolly: the outspoken leftwinger set to be Ireland’s next president Seán Cormac obituary Black History Month is a reflection of the political moment, so how do we revamp it?
