• We said Kemi Badenoch “went on to retain her seat” in the 2024 election with a majority reduced by almost 25,000 (No regicide yet as Tory rivals bide their time, 9 October, p6). To clarify, in 2019 she was elected MP for Saffron Walden with a 27,594 majority and then in 2024 elected in a redrawn constituency, North West Essex, with a 2,610 majority. • Dev Hynes started his musical career in the 2000s, not 2010s as an article said (‘I knew grief was going to bite me’, 24 October, G2, p6). • Other recently amended articles include: Georgia election board member accepted anonymous donations linked to ‘election integrity’ movement Cutting Through Rocks review – the female firebrand fighting the patriarchy in rural Iran Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
