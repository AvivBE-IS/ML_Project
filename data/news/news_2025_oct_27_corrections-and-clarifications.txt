Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• An article (Royal Albert Hall hosts star wrestlers in London for first time in three decades, 15 October, p5) referred to the chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, Hakkaku Rijicho, on second mention as “Rijicho”. In Japanese, this is his honorary title as chairman; since his retirement as a wrestler he has been known by his sumo elder name Hakkaku. Also, a reference to the “Bournemouth Philharmonic” should have been to the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, a separate group. • Other recently amended articles include: ‘Reform didn’t have any idea about south Wales’: Plaid Cymru supporters celebrate byelection win Americans brace for food stamps to run out: ‘The greatest hunger catastrophe since the Great Depression’ Politics continues by other means as Toronto Blue Jays face LA Dodgers What is the White House East Wing and why has it been torn down in Trump’s renovation plans? Cruise control: could a £5 ‘entry’ fee help balance Orkney’s needs with tourist demand? Surgeons remove up to 100 magnets from New Zealand teenager’s intestines Don’t believe the hype: why Australian taxpayers should be wary of the critical minerals deal with Trump ‘Somerset saved my sanity’: Don McCullin at 90 – in pictures Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
