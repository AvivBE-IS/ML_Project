Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• An article (Families wrongly stripped of child benefit in HMRC fraud crackdown, 28 October, p17, late editions) indicated that “almost 35,000” claimants had had their benefits suspended; the actual figure, provided by HMRC after publication, is 23,489. • It was the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, not the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, that was the source for figures on practical driving tests (Scams exploit frustration over driving test delays, 11 October, p43). • Other recently amended articles include: ‘I was contaminated’: study reveals how hard it is to avoid pesticide exposure Referees at Manchester United and Brentford got heat but there is much to learn from the decisions Mollie O’Callaghan breaks 200m record – again – to end stunning week at Swimming World Cup There must be an Engels (playing with my chart) Greece accuses British Museum of ‘provocative indifference’ over pink ball Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
