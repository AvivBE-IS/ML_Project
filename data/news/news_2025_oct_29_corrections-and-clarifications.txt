Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• An article said that a recent National Maternity and Perinatal Audit report, published in September this year, had found that 3.29% of women who gave birth vaginally in England, Scotland and Wales in 2023 suffered a perineal tear “of some sort”. This was actually the percentage of women who suffered a third- or fourth-degree perineal tear (New mothers at rising risk of birth tears in England, 17 October, p10 from p1). • Other recently amended articles include: Peer trying to derail UK smoking ban discussed bill with relative at tobacco firm As Netherlands goes to the polls again, Geert Wilders faces isolation Voting opens in Netherlands as narrowing polls suggest second Geert Wilders win Lady Annabel Goldsmith obituary Newcastle Women charged by FA with six illegal approaches to Sunderland players Tattoo fixers on removing Nazi symbols: ‘You don’t know if they’re changing or hiding’ Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
