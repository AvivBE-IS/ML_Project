Corrections and clarifications
------------------------------------------------------------
• Mikey Lewis plays rugby league for Hull KR, not St Helens as a picture caption said (Wane banks on experience as 22-year Ashes hiatus comes to an end at Wembley, 25 October, Sport, p14). This error was in print only. • An article (Grandchildren of Ruth Ellis, last woman hanged in UK, seek posthumous pardon, 22 October, p19) said that it was watching the ITV drama A Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis Story that changed Laura Enston’s perspective of her grandmother’s case. It was in fact reading Carol Ann Lee’s book A Fine Day for a Hanging, which inspired the TV series. • A clue in Monday’s quick crossword, no 17,309, sought “Hyderabad’s city (5)”; this should have said “country” (27 October, G2, p12). • Other recently amended articles include: ‘Morrisons killed us’: Britain’s most westerly mainland village shop closes after half a century Carabao Cup quarter-final draw: Arsenal v Palace, Man City v Brentford and more – as it happened Reform UK would let ministers ignore international law, Kruger says Young first-time buyers forced into ‘nature deserts’, England data shows ‘I’m being punished’: Emily is healthy enough to leave hospital but her NDIS plan isn’t enough to support her at home A strange brew: the case of the man behind an audacious Scottish tea fraud ‘It’s insanely sinister’: horror writers on the scariest stories they’ve ever read Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
