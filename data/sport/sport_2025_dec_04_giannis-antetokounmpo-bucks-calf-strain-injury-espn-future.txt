Bucks’ Giannis Antetokounmpo reportedly out for two to four weeks with calf strain
------------------------------------------------------------
Milwaukee Bucks star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo is expected to miss around two to four weeks with a right calf strain, according to an ESPN report. The injury occurred less than three minutes into Wednesday night’s win over the Detroit Pistons. Antetokounmpo collapsed without contact as he tried to get back on defense and immediately reached for his lower right leg. Teammates helped him to his feet, and he walked gingerly to the bench before heading to the locker room. Bucks coach Doc Rivers said after the game that preliminary imaging ruled out an achilles injury, easing initial concerns. Antetokounmpo, who turns 31 on Saturday, recently missed four games with a left groin strain but had played Milwaukee’s previous three contests. The setback came hours after ESPN reported that Antetokounmpo is weighing his future with the Bucks. Charania reported that he and his agent, Alex Saratsis, have been in dialogue with the team about whether Milwaukee remains the ideal long-term fit for the two-time NBA Most Valuable Player. Rivers, speaking before tipoff, dismissed that characterization, saying there had been “no conversations” of that nature and insisting that Antetokounmpo “loves Milwaukee and he loves the Bucks”.
