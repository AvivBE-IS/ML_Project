Treylon Burks’ one-handed miracle catch draws comparisons to Odell Beckham’s Giants grab
------------------------------------------------------------
Odell Beckham’s Jr’s miracle grab in 2014 may remain the best NFL catch this century, but Treylon Burks’ effort on Sunday pushes it close. During the third-quarter of Sunday’s game between the Commanders and Broncos, the Washington receiver reached behind him as he fell backwards in the end zone and grabbed a Marcus Mariota pass with his right hand. He secured the ball as he fell to the turf and his touchdown tied the game at 13-13. The catch was reminiscent of Beckham’s catch for the Giants in 2014, which also game on NBC’s Sunday Night Football broadcast. However, that catch – which also resulted in a touchdown – came via a longer pass. Beckham was one of the first to praise Burks. “13 13,” he wrote on X, a reference to the jersey number the two receivers share. Burks’ touchdown was just the second of his four-year NFL career. The Tennessee Titans selected him in the first-round of the 2022 draft but he was released by the team earlier this season and was generally viewed as a bust. He was only added to the Commanders’ active roster after an injury to Luke McCaffrey. Burks’ grab was not the only brilliant one-handed catch on Sunday. Brock Bowers dove low to snag a touchdown for the Raiders in their loss to the Chargers.
