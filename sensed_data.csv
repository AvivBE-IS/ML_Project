culture_2025_dec_02_jon-stewart-trump-mri-tim-walz.txt,culture,2025-12-02,Guardian staff,Jon Stewart on Trump claiming not to know about his own MRI: ‘That’s not physically possible’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/02/jon-stewart-trump-mri-tim-walz,"Late-night hosts tore into Donald Trump for his use of an ableist slur and unconvincing attempts to assuage concerns about his cognitive abilities. Jon Stewart As the Thanksgiving spirit gave way to the work week, Jon Stewart tore into the president for using an ableist slur to describe the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz. In a Truth Social post over the weekend, Trump called Walz, who ran against him last year as Kamala Harris’s running mate, “seriously retarded”. “On Thanksgiving?! Are you confusing that with Festivus?” the Daily Show host exclaimed on Monday evening. Days later, asked by reporters if he regretted his remarks, Trump doubled down, saying that there was “something seriously wrong” with the Democratic governor. “Something wrong with him? With him?” Stewart fumed. “You were sitting with your family at Thanksgiving, belly full of turkey and pie, surrounded by the love of your extended crime family, but your initial instinct was to Truth a slur at Tim Walz? And there’s something wrong with him? “The press corps had to spend the whole holiday weekend down at Mar-a-Lago, listening to this brain ooze, and then, they couldn’t even go back home by themselves,” he added. “They had to fly back with this nut and ask him if he wants to clarify any of the nonsense.” In fact, Trump attempted to assuage recurring concerns about his health and cognitive abilities, including a recently revealed MRI scan in October, by claiming that he had “no idea” what part of the body was even scanned. “It was just an MRI,” he said. “What part of the body? It wasn’t the brain because I took a cognitive test, and I aced it.” “That’s not physically possible,” Stewart responded. “To have no idea, it’s not possible. What would you say to the doctor? ‘No no no, don’t tell me. I want to find out at my MRI reveal party.’ “For God’s sakes, man, were you not curious at all?” he continued. “When they laid you down in a tube for a half an hour to 45 minutes, you didn’t want to know what they might be doing? Or did you just think to yourself, ‘What a loud tanning bed’?” Stewart also mocked Trump’s claim that he got a “perfect score” on his MRI. “That’s how they score the MRIs,” Stewart joked. “You either get a big stamp, ‘Perfect,’ or you get in red ink, ‘See me.’” Stephen Colbert “Maga folks are starting to notice that Trump treats them like meat animals,” said Stephen Colbert on Monday’s Late Show, citing a Daily Beast interview with former supporters angry with the president for building a gilded ballroom instead of tackling affordability. “I’ll have you know that the entire purpose of that ballroom is to serve the poor — and they will be delicious,” Colbert quipped. In other news, “Trump celebrated Thanksgiving in his traditional way – with racism,” Colbert quipped, referring to Trump’s anti-immigrant rant on Truth Social from the weekend. “Somewhere in all of that nonsense”, he attacked Minnesota’s immigration policies and used an ableist slur to describe Walz. Walz responded: “Release the MRI results.” Trump then said he would release the results, though he didn’t know what part of the body was scanned. “Uh, here’s a theory: maybe the part that’s broken is the part that’s supposed to know,” Colbert noted. “As per usual, after the president said something, the White House scrambled to justify it,” he continued. And on Monday afternoon, Trump’s staff posted a letter from Trump’s doctor claiming that the MRI was given “because men in his age group benefit from a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health”. “OK, fair enough,” said Colbert. “Men in his age group also benefit from retiring, so … can we write that prescription next?” Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel also blasted Trump for using an ableist slur. “See, he can be presidential when he wants to be!” he joked. “I wonder why he didn’t get that Nobel peace prize. It makes no sense.” As for Trump’s follow-up on Air Force One – emphasizing of Walz that “I think there’s something wrong with him” – Kimmel was blunt: “another bold statement from the president of the eighth grade”. Trump also continued to claim that his approval ratings had never been higher, “which means it’s not just books he can’t read”, said Kimmel. With a negative rating of 60%, “there are gas station bathrooms on Yelp with higher approval ratings than Donald Trump right now.” Kimmel then touched on Trump’s promise to pardon Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras who was sentenced last year to 45 years in prison for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway to the United States”. “Now some have pointed out the unbelievable hypocrisy of Trump, blowing up boats and killing random Venezuelans because he believes there are low-level drug runners in the boats, while simultaneously pardoning a man who sent a million pounds of cocaine to this country,” said Kimmel. “But those people are just haters and losers, you know? Lighten up! “When he was running for president, Trump made it very clear: his top priorities were a) pardoning drug kingpins and b) building a place to ballroom dance,” he added. “Promises made, promises kept.”"
culture_2025_dec_03_late-night-roundup-trump-truth-social.txt,culture,2025-12-03,Guardian staff,Jimmy Kimmel on the Trump administration: ‘They have better-quality cabinets at Ikea’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/03/late-night-roundup-trump-truth-social,"Late-night hosts tore into Donald Trump’s five-hour Truth Social posting spree and his inability to stay awake during cabinet meetings. Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel wasted no time in returning to his favorite target – Donald Trump – on Tuesday evening. “I know I’ve said this before, but for real this time: he went completely off the rails last night,” the host began. “The man who is allegedly running the country banged out an onslaught of posts and reposts in a furious social media blitzkrieg that started at 7.09pm, went nonstop until almost midnight.” In that five-hour span on Monday night, Kimmel noted, the president posted 116 times, at an average of every two minutes. “Do you know how long you have to be on the toilet to post that much?” he laughed. “I mean, what is he eating?” Kimmel then mocked Trump’s press-friendly cabinet meeting on Tuesday, in which he baselessly and impossibly claimed that revenue from his tariffs would lead to the elimination of the US income tax. “Well, he would know – he hasn’t paid income tax in, what, 50 years?” Kimmel noted. “Does anyone believe we’re not going to have income tax to pay? This is like the kid running for student council who promises soda in the drinking fountains. It makes no sense.” During the meeting, Trump also pushed back on a recent New York Times report that he had cut back on public appearances because he’s showing signs of fatigue. “Which is ridiculous. Does this look like a man who is showing signs of fatigue?” Kimmel joked before clips of Trump appearing to fall asleep at the meeting, even dozing off during a presentation by the gravelly voiced Robert F Kennedy Jr. “I mean, if you can sleep through that voice, you are tired. You are fatigued,” he said. “Of course he’s tired – he was up all night posting!” Kimmel then launched into a blistering summary of the Trump cabinet in attendance: “We have a twice-baked RFK Jr, who is now embroiled in a sex-and-drug scandal with a reporter nearly 40 years his junior. Our secretary of war is murdering unidentified civilians and trying to throw the admiral who is following orders under the boat. The director of the FBI is reportedly using a private jet for personal travel with his country music star girlfriend and delayed a murder investigation until somebody brought him an FBI jacket that fit his little body. “We’ve got the attorney general turning the justice department into the Keystone Cops,” he continued. “We have a wrestling magnate running the Department of Education who wants to get rid of the Department of Education. Our director of homeland security somehow has made killing a puppy the least controversial thing she’s done. She’s busy rounding up college girls and deporting them to God knows where. And our healthcare is in the vitamin supplement-powered hands of Dr Oz. “They have better-quality cabinets at Ikea,” he concluded. Stephen Colbert The year 2025 has “been a rough one”, said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. “I mean, obviously, there’s no one to blame for that, other than Donald Trump. “And a lot of people are,” he said, citing a new Gallup poll that found the president’s approval rating has dropped to 36%, with 60% disapproval. “Which is why Trump has started wearing a new hat: ‘More Popular Than Syphilis’,” Colbert joked. “So Trump is underwater in every category,” he continued, showing specific disapproval numbers on the economy, healthcare, the Epstein files, education and the environment. “Donald Trump is also the most hated Zootopia character, the lowest-rated midsize sedan and the least popular Oreo flavor, double-stuffed cankle,” Colbert quipped. But Trump’s worst bugbear as president remains the cost of living for average Americans. “He has been trying everything he can think of, which is not much,” said Colbert. On Tuesday, in one of his “weird cabinet meetings” that lasted three hours, Trump “addressed the affordability crisis head-on”. Specifically, Trump dismissed the concept of “affordability” as a “con job by the Democrats”. “It’s one of the many con job words made up by the Democrats, like democracy, dementia and da-Epstein files,” Colbert joked. Colbert also commented on Trump appearing to nap during his own cabinet meeting. “Let’s be fair – maybe he’s so old that he fell asleep in an afternoon meeting, or maybe he just closed his eyes to better concentrate on filling his adult diaper,” he speculated. “Then, he fell asleep.” The Daily Show And on The Daily Show, Desi Lydic checked in on the self-proclaimed “secretary of war”, Pete Hegseth, now in hot water for authorizing strikes on supposedly suspected drug-runner boats off the coast of Venezuela. Members of both parties and experts have said that the strikes constitute war crimes. “There’s one thing we know: if somebody did something wrong, he’s going to man up and take responsibility as the secretary of war,” Lydic deadpanned. Hegseth, naturally, placed the blame squarely on his commander, Adm Mitch Bradley. On X, Hegseth wrote: “I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made – on the September 2 mission and all others since.” “What a little bitch,” said Lydic. “Blaming someone by pretending to praise them? ‘I stand by him and all the decisions he made on his own, while I was out of the room. If you want to get to him, you’re going to have to get through me – and I will let you do that.’” “I also love how Pete’s pre-blaming Bradley for ‘all the others since’,” she added. “So yeah, things are starting to look a little dicey for the secretary of defensiveness, but Pete is fighting back the way a true warrior does: with memes.” Hegseth posted an image of Franklin the Turtle, a children’s character, shooting at a boat from a helicopter. “This whole image is deeply disturbing,” said Lydic. “Especially the part where the turtle is wearing a helmet – why is he wearing a helmet? His whole body is a helmet.”"
culture_2025_dec_03_norman-conquest-chew-valley-coin-exhibition-bath.txt,culture,2025-12-03,Steven Morris,Norman conquest coin hoard to go on show in Bath before permanent display,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/03/norman-conquest-chew-valley-coin-exhibition-bath,"The coins were buried in a valley in the English West Country almost 1,000 years ago at a time of huge political and social turmoil. A millennium on, plans have been announced to bring the Chew Valley Hoard, 2,584 silver coins hidden shortly after the Norman conquest, back to the south-west of England. The feelgood story of how the coins, worth more than £4m, were found by a band of metal detectorists will be told but visitors will also be encouraged to reflect on how the world continues to be gripped by worries about conflict, the actions of the powerful and money. Sam Astill, the chief executive of South West Heritage Trust, which acquired the hoard for the nation last year, said the idea was not just about showing off the coins and telling their history. He said: “There will also be a conversation about turning points, turning points in history or in people’s lives. The Chew Valley Hoard represents a turning point in our nation’s story. “But as well as evoking the turmoil after the [Norman] conquest, there’s a contemporary significance we’re seeking as well. I think we will ask our visitors to imagine what it must have felt like in 1066 and 1067 when the ruling class had been abolished and there was essentially no government. Obviously, they will draw on their own perspectives and ideas in responding.” The hoard was discovered by seven detectorists south of Bath in 2019. Last year the coins were acquired for the nation and went on display at the British Museum in London, where they were seen by thousands of visitors. The hoard is now in storage at the museum. On Wednesday South West Heritage Trust announced a £993,345 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to deliver a two-year engagement project to celebrate the hoard and mark the 1,000th anniversary of William the Conqueror’s birth, in 1028. The coins will be shown at the Roman Baths Museum, Bath, from January to March 2027. They will then be moved to a temporary exhibition space at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton while a permanent gallery for them is built there. There will be other activities, learning opportunities and events centred on the coins. It is believed the hoard was buried for safekeeping in 1067 or 1068, a time of rebellions in the south-west against William the Conqueror. Represented on just under half the coins is Harold II, the last crowned Anglo-Saxon king of England, who was killed at the Battle of Hastings. A little over half feature William the Conqueror. There is one coin that features Edward the Confessor. About 100 moneyers – the individuals in charge of producing coins – from 46 mints including Bath, Bristol, Exeter, Hastings, Ipswich, London and York are represented. The coins of Harold II are mainly from mints in south-east England, perhaps suggesting financial preparation for the Norman invasion. Astill said that while many people had a concept of 1066 and the Battle of Hastings, they know less about what happened afterwards. “There was a long transition to full-blown Norman rule and there were periods of turmoil and rebellion particularly here in the south-west.” Exeter, 70 miles south-west of where the hoard was buried, was a centre of resistance to the Normans and was besieged by William in 1068. “It may be that the coins were deposited for safe keeping during that period,” Astill said. Federica Smith-Roberts, a councillor at Somerset council and the executive member for communities, housing and culture, said: “The Chew Valley Hoard is a hugely significant treasure in every sense of the word and we cannot wait to welcome it back home to Somerset.”"
culture_2025_dec_04_late-night-roundup-hegseth-trump-naps.txt,culture,2025-12-04,Guardian staff,"Jimmy Kimmel on Pete Hegseth, ‘our secretary of war crimes’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/04/late-night-roundup-hegseth-trump-naps,"Late-night hosts tore into Pete Hegseth’s Venezuelan boat blame game, Donald Trump’s cabinet meeting naps and the annual Spotify Wrapped lists. Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel opened his Wednesday-evening monologue with an acknowledgement of a yearly tradition: the annual Spotify Wrapped list, documenting users’ listening habits for the year. “This Spotify, they really have it figured out,” he said. “They spy on you all year. It’s what they do. And then December comes around and they’re like, ‘We’ve been watching you.’ And we’re like, ‘Awesome! What did you find out?’” “I don’t know why other companies don’t do this,” he continued. “Like imagine getting this from Pornhub, you know? ‘You violated yourself for 6,322 minutes this year – up 5% from 2024! Your favorite genres are stepmothers and Dragonball Z.” Kimmel then turned his attention to the Maga-world freakout over criticism of Trump for falling asleep during a lengthy cabinet meeting on Monday. “The fact is, we all watched him dozing off repeatedly on television. Which meant that the Don Trump Admiration and Ball-Gobbling Society was forced to go into overdrive today to defend him,” Kimmel said before several clips of Maga supporters trying to brush off the story on cable news. “If you sleep three hours or four hours a night, you’re probably going to close your eyes, whether you’re 79 or 49,” said Laura Ingraham on Fox News. “I mean, who wouldn’t doze off in one of these things?” said a Newsmax host. And Dr Marc Siegel, a Fox News “senior medical analyst”, claimed that Thomas Edison believed in 10-minute naps – “What would they say? We wouldn’t have electricity, right?” “Right. It’s such a good point,” Kimmel deadpanned, mimicking Siegel – “Is that what you liberals want, no electricity? Because we will give that to you!” But “no one’s losing more sleep this week than our secretary of war crimes”, Pete Hegseth, under fire for authorizing a strike on a boat off the coast of Venezuela that was allegedly being used to smuggle drugs, and then a second strike to kill all survivors. The ranks of people calling for the prosecution of Hegseth for violating international law now includes Andrew Napolitano, a former co-worker of Hegseth’s on Fox News and a conservative commentator on the rightwing channel Newsmax. “Do you know how badly a member of Trump’s inner circle has to screw up to get criticized on Newsmax?” Kimmel mused. “I mean, if Pete Hegseth had run that guy’s foot over, he would’ve said, ‘It’s OK, I’ve got another one!’ Now he’s saying, ‘Lock him up, this is a war crime.’” Stephen Colbert And on The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also checked in on Hegseth, still under fire for “maybe definitely committing war crimes”. “They argue that those Venezuelan boats deserve to be blowed up real good because trust us, those are drug smugglers,” Colbert said. So he found it “a little odd” that on Friday, Trump announced that he would pardon former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted last year of conspiracy to import more than 400 tons of cocaine to the US. “For reference, here’s a picture of what a 400lb bag of cocaine would look like,” Colbert joked next to a photo of Donald Trump Jr. Asked about the double standard of pardoning a notorious drug trafficker while onboard Air Force One, Trump answered: “Well, I don’t know who you’re talking about. Which one?” “Which one?! How many notorious drug traffickers have you pardoned?” Colbert responded. In other White House news, the first lady released a new version of her seven-hour audiobook, in which she reads her memoir in Spanish. “It’s the perfect listen on a long road trip inside a windowless ICE van,” Colbert quipped. It’s an interesting accomplishment given that, although the first lady claims to speak five languages, she is not known to speak Spanish. “How did Melania do it?” Colbert wondered. “Well, it’s as lazy as you can imagine,” as the audiobook uses an AI-generated version of her voice, which one can listen to for $25. “Just like the work of that other great Spanish-language author, Gabriel García Mar2-D2,” Colbert quipped."
culture_2025_dec_05_pantone-cloud-dancer-2026-colour-year.txt,culture,2025-12-05,Emma Joyce explains it to Nick Miller,A minimalist statement or just Pantonedeaf? ‘Cloud dancer’ shade of white named Pantone’s 2026 colour of the year,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/05/pantone-cloud-dancer-2026-colour-year,"Hi, Emma! I’m so pumped to find out what colour 2026 is going to be. Fill me in! Brace yourself, Nick. Every year since 1999 Pantone chooses a colour for the year, a representation of the zeitgeist – from how we’re feeling to what we’re wearing, how we’re styling our homes and even our eyebrows. Last year’s was the darker shade of beige “mocha mousse”, the year before that was the soft, warm “peach fuzz”. This year’s pick is even more baffling. It’s “cloud dancer”, a “billowy, balanced white”, according to Pantone. Laurie Pressman, vice-president of Pantone Color Institute, said it is “a key structural color … allowing all colors to shine”. Hmmm, cloud dancer, sounds … wait, white? Are they trolling us? Is it even a proper colour? How do you describe the colour of clouds? Milk? A blank page? White is considered a colour by some but essentially all colour is a range of visible light. It’s one of the colours in my kid’s crayon box so I’m saying yes. Whether Pantone is trolling us is harder to ascertain. It says cloud dancer mixes well with others, isn’t overstimulating, makes a minimalist statement and exudes quiet sophistication. The reactions, though, are not as complimentary. Some say Pantone is completely “Pantonedeaf”. The fashion and trend forecaster Mandy Lee called it “disappointing”. Others have likened it to the coded promotion of eugenics in the Sydney Sweeney American Eagle ad. Yeah, right, hopefully they’re cheerfully oblivious about the fact this is not a great time to be pointedly celebrating whiteness … So how should I, a person rarely adjacent to a catwalk, make use of this information in my daily life? I just painted my kitchen ceiling white, does that count? It counts. As would your headphones, or your bathtub. It’s funny you mention catwalks, because many of this year’s have been bright, bold and fuzzy, including naturally dyed fake feathers on the runway at Stella McCartney’s Paris fashion week show. White featured, as it always does, in simple silk T-shirts at Chanel, collared dresses at Givenchy, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, wore a crisp all-white ensemble to Balenciaga’s Paris show. The US first lady, Melania Trump, is often seen wearing all white. The good news is: you probably already own something in the “discrete” (sic) and “understated” colour of the year. As Pressman said, Cloud Dancer “represents a more sustainable choice for the eco-conscious”, and to me that means not having to buy anything new at all. AT LAST, a fashion trend for the deeply unmotivated. A blank page, if you will. A cocoon of monochromatic zen amid the chaos. OK, I’m on board. Are you planning a whiteout for your wardrobe? Absolutely not. Have you tried removing tomato sauce stains from a white shirt? I don’t need more laundry disasters in 2026. I do own a pair of once-white Birkenstocks though, and those never go out of style."

It’s barely bigger than a paving slab, but since the pond has been in place we have had a garden teeming with frogs, hedgehogs have taken up residence and bird life has abounded. Not only do humble ponds like this give nature a boost; they also help to buffer climate extremes. In recent decades, Britain’s ponds have been disappearing, with research revealing that more than half of our dense network of ponds has been lost since the 1900s. Lucy Clarke and colleagues found that 58% of ponds in the Severn Vale region of the UK had been lost since the 1900s, with the average distance between ponds increasing by 25 metres over that time. Similar trends can be seen worldwide, with intensive agriculture and urbanisation obliterating these seemingly insignificant bodies of water. But now a pond revival is under way, with even tiny ponds such as mine helping to create biodiversity hotspots, plus provide cooling during heatwaves and help to slow the flow of water during heavy rains, reducing pressure on our overloaded drains and recharging parched groundwater reservoirs. Previously overlooked, ponds large and small are starting to be recognised as a vital habitat and a small but mighty climate mitigation tool."
news_2025_dec_04_record-numbers-becoming-billionaires-through-inheritance-ubs-report-finds.txt,news,2025-12-04,Lauren Almeida,"Record numbers becoming billionaires through inheritance, UBS report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/04/record-numbers-becoming-billionaires-through-inheritance-ubs-report-finds,"The super-rich are inheriting record levels of wealth as they pass down billions of dollars to their children, grandchildren and spouses, research by a Swiss bank favoured by billionaires shows. Globally, there are 2,919 billionaires this year, up from 2,682 in 2024, UBS found. Of these, 91 people this year became billionaires through inheritance, collectively receiving $298bn (£223bn) in the 12 months to April, the bank said. That was up more than a third against last year and the highest since UBS started its research in 2015. Among them are the six grandchildren of the late Asian paint tycoon Goh Cheng Liang, who died in Singapore in August aged 98. Each grandchild inherited stakes in a public company worth more than $1bn, according to reports. Meanwhile, 196 “self-made” entrepreneurs became billionaires this year, with a collective wealth of $386.5bn, UBS said. Benjamin Cavalli, an executive at the bank, said the increase in billionaire inheritance was proof of a “multi-year wealth transfer that’s intensifying”, with this group expected to inherit at least $5.9tn in the next 15 years. Most of the inheritance is expected to come from the US, followed by India, France, Germany and Switzerland. The UK ranked seventh, with $164bn in wealth expected to be passed down over the next 15 years. However, this could change as footloose billionaires move around the world, motivated by a better quality of life, geopolitical concerns and tax considerations, UBS found. Various European governments have faced calls to introduce a wealth tax on the international elite this year. In Switzerland, where UBS estimates that $206bn will be inherited over the next 15 years, voters on Sunday overwhelmingly rejected a proposed 50% tax on inherited fortunes of £47m or more. In October, the French parliament voted against a proposed 2% tax on fortunes over €100m. Italy, which has attracted many wealthy residents thanks to its flat-tax regime for foreign income, has set out plans to increase the levy by 50% to €300,000 a year from 2026. Meanwhile, the UK, which distanced itself from reports of a formal wealth tax over the summer, officially ended non-dom status this year under which UK residents who declared their permanent home as overseas could avoid paying UK tax on foreign income and gains. It also announced plans for a council tax surcharge, labelled a “mansion tax”, on homes worth more than £2m in last week’s budget. Last year, Spain, Brazil, Germany and South Africa signed a motion at the G20 for a minimum 2% tax on the super-rich to reduce inequality and raise public funds. Forecasts on its impact vary, but a study by the leading French economist Gabriel Zucman found it could net up to $250bn in extra revenue. The four countries have called on other governments to support the campaign, saying a levy on the ultra-wealthy would complement negotiations on the taxation of the digital economy and continuing efforts to bring in a global minimum corporate tax of 15% for multinational businesses. • This article was amended on 4 December 2025. Because of an error in the UBS report, an earlier version said there are 9,919 billionaires around the world this year. This figure has been corrected to 2,919."

In this week’s newsletter we have charts on the revenue required to pay for all this AI infrastructure, how natural disasters are distorting the US home insurance market, and how much little sex gen Z is having. But first … whither group voting tickets? In Australia, Victoria is the last state still using group voting tickets (GVTs) to elect its upper house. This is where voters can vote “above the line” for a party, which then gets to decide where the vote goes after the party’s candidates are eliminated. GVTs have long been exploited, with backroom deals between parties allowing little-known candidates to leapfrog rivals who received far, far more primary votes. As happened in 2018: With Victoria’s electoral matters committee recommending group voting tickets be abolished this week, we took a deep dive into what exactly they are, and what the various options are to replace them and reform the system. Four charts from the fortnight *** 1. An incredible loss Julian Fell and Georgina Piper at the ABC have a devastating story of a man who lost more than US$180k gambling in a crypto casino, including more than US$40k in just eight days: Content warning: the ABC story contains references to suicide. Elsewhere the ABC also had this dire story about rental affordability and some nice charts using the latest wave of the Australian Election Study. *** 2. Harder and harder to insure In 2020, about 222,000 Californian homes were covered by state-run or state-backed insurers of “last resort” as private companies wouldn’t cover them. With many of these homes increasingly prone to natural disasters, that number jumped by more than 100,000 in 2023. Reuters have a wonderfully designed visual story looking at how climate change is driving this trend and how these non-profit insurers may be feeding a vicious cycle. *** 3. Stacks on stacks on stacks There’s been a rich vein of charts looking at the “AI bubble” recently, but this one from the Washington Post really caught our attention: It’s not just because its a bar chart – The Crunch’s chart of choice. But that, according to JP Morgan, the tech industry will need an extra US$650bn in revenue every year just to earn a 10% return on all this investment. For context, Google’s 2024 revenue was US$350bn and OpenAI has annual revenues of about US$20bn. *** 4. More distribution charts, please A lot of fancy graphics focus on means and medians and other summary stats, hiding all the nuance of the actual distribution of the data. There’s a great exception in this story from Works in Progress: Really recommend a click through to this fascinating story about how English is becoming easier to read. Bonus: there’s a scatterplot!

news_2025_dec_05_weather-watch-everyday-phrases-nautical-expressions-wind-language.txt,news,2025-12-05,David Hambling,‘Three sheets to the wind’: how everyday phrases blew in from the sea,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/05/weather-watch-everyday-phrases-nautical-expressions-wind-language,"Some everyday expressions have an obvious nautical origin such as “all at sea” and “an even keel”. But plenty of others have slipped into the language unnoticed, including a number derived from how sailors talked about the wind. Surprisingly, “overbearing” was originally a nautical term, meaning having an advantage over another ship by carrying more canvas safely and so being able to sail faster. The expression came to be used metaphorically to describe an approaching storm or anything else that could not be outrun. Similarly to “bear down” on something was to approach forcefully with the wind behind. “Veering”, from the French “virer”, meaning to turn, was first applied to the change in direction of the wind. Specifically, it means a movement clockwise. A wind that shifts anticlockwise, say from north to west, is “backing” rather than veering. “By and large” originally referred to a ship alternately sailing as close to the wind as possible, known as sailing “by the wind”, and sailing in the direction the wind is blowing in. The expression came to mean under most conditions, or in general. These expressions are amphibians that have moved from the sea to exist on land, leaving behind all traces of the ocean winds and making themselves at home in suburbia."

Last month, the government bowed to pressure from campaigners and pledged to make depictions of strangulation illegal. Research showing that a majority of children have viewed this kind of material is extremely disturbing, all the more so given evidence that viewing “choking” makes people – mostly men – more likely to do it in real life. This week, the Guardian examined the distressing effects of deepfake pornography in schools, and interviewed the women behind the successful campaign to criminalise the nonconsensual creation of deepfake intimate images. Ofcom’s announcement that it has issued a £1m fine to a Belize-based pornography company, AVS Group, thus seems timely. Oliver Griffiths, the regulator’s director of online safety, referred on BBC radio to a “tide turning” as enforcement powers in the Online Safety Act take effect. The age-verification checks on AVS’s websites, introduced to protect children, are judged not to be effective enough. If the company does not pay up, Mr Griffiths said that he would move to block the site. One thing everyone connected with online regulation agrees on is that technology is moving at an incredible rate. The danger is that societies, and the systems we use to manage risks, can’t keep up. While it is good to see Ofcom taking action, it is alarming that 90 other companies – 83 of which run pornography sites – are also being investigated, with further fines said to be imminent. Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, warned last month that the regulator was in danger of losing public trust if it did not up the pace of implementation of the Online Safety Act and get on top of emerging threats. Regulation and enforcement in the online space is complicated. When Ofcom issued a £20,000 fine to the controversial forum 4chan, the companies behind it and another forum, Kiwi Farms, filed a legal case. They want a US court to rule that the UK’s online safety laws and codes of conduct do not apply to them. Such challenges make Ofcom’s task harder. But it must not be cowed. Campaigners such as Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly took her own life after viewing harmful material, are right to highlight the moral imperative to make the internet safer for children. They want a new “duty of candour” for public officials to apply to tech companies too, and for the regulator to be more proactive and less passive. This is all made even more urgent by emerging concerns about agentic AI, or chatbots, which stand accused of acting as “suicide coaches” in several US lawsuits. If Ms Kendall believes that there are gaps in current online safety laws, as she said on Wednesday, she must close them. Beeban Kidron, the crossbench peer and online safety campaigner, has laid amendments to the government’s crime and policing bill that would achieve this. Ministers should not drag their heels, as happened with deepfake images. Online safety is not the only area in which Ofcom is accused of damaging inaction. It has also appeared reluctant to tackle racism and misinformation about climate policy on GB News. Regulatory oversight of news and other media have always been important. But in our age of pocket computers, shape-shifting tech and political polarisation, questions about Ofcom’s performance – particularly in relation to children – have arguably never been more pressing."
commentisfree_2025_dec_04_the-guardian-view-on-the-crown-estate-inquiry-a-necessary-probe-and-a-wider-debate.txt,opinion,2025-12-04,Editorial,The Guardian view on the crown estate inquiry: a necessary probe and a wider debate,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-crown-estate-inquiry-a-necessary-probe-and-a-wider-debate,"Everyone in Britain has views about the royal family. In many cases, lots of views. Britain’s parliament, however, never lets the subject pass its lips. By long tradition, the House of Commons prohibits itself from any mention, let alone any discussion, of the monarchy or the royal family. This self-imposed gag – in which a centuries-old constitutional monarchy is unable to discuss constitutional monarchy – is infantilising and indefensible. The gag may, however, be loosening. This week, the Commons public accounts committee announced an inquiry into the crown estate. The probe is a direct response to news that the disgraced former Prince Andrew (now Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor) and his brother Prince Edward have been paying “peppercorn rents” for very extensive properties owned by the estate. It is an extremely unusual move in the modern era. The crown estate is a public body, established by statute in 1961. It is independent of both monarch and government. It is also a highly successful and profitable property company worth an estimated £15.5bn. Since David Cameron abolished the civil list system in 2011, the crown gets a generous and protected “sovereign grant” from the estate’s profits each year. As the estate gets a cut of all offshore wind development, among other things, the sovereign grant has provided a royal windfall that might have gone to the Treasury. The grant is due for review in 2026. It should be part of the new inquiry. Royal finances are an entirely legitimate subject for full parliamentary accountability, and the kind of scrutiny advocated in the Guardian’s Cost of the crown series. As the Treasury accepted last week in a letter to the committee chair, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the estate commissioners have “a statutory duty to maintain and enhance the value of the estate and the returns obtained from it”. In other words, as Sir Geoffrey had earlier informed the Treasury, the estate must provide “value for money”. The committee is therefore doing its job by inquiring whether this is happening. Its findings are likely to generate great public interest, and rightly so. Value for money is a yardstick that inescapably unlocks the wider debate that parliament ought to routinely be holding about the appropriate workings of the monarchy. The inquiry is doubtless unwelcome for Buckingham Palace. But the announcement this week – a week in which David Dimbleby also began a strikingly sceptical BBC One series entitled What’s the Monarchy For? – may be a sign that times are changing for the crown. That is partly because of changing attitudes. More specifically, it is also because the inquiry should lift a stone on the as yet unpublicised terms under which “grace and favour” residences were, and are, allocated. In addition, it should reveal the terms and responsibilities for ensuring their upkeep. This may mean further unwelcome stories for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and for the palace. The committee should not flinch from this task out of misplaced deference. Value for money is a proper and powerful tool of public accountability, whether applied to the NHS or to the monarchy. As the former Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker has argued, the thoroughness of the inquiry will be judged in part by whether it can clarify the number of royal grace-and-favour residences and their costs. According to Mr Baker, in 1993, the last year for which he was able to discover a figure for such residences, there were 272. By contrast, the number of “working” royals stands at 11.

commentisfree_2025_dec_05_agriculture-revolution-soil-farming-earth-rover-program.txt,opinion,2025-12-05,George Monbiot,"Over a pint in Oxford, we may have stumbled upon the holy grail of agriculture",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/05/agriculture-revolution-soil-farming-earth-rover-program,"It felt like walking up a mountain during a temperature inversion. You struggle through fog so dense you can scarcely see where you’re going. Suddenly, you break through the top of the cloud, and the world is laid out before you. It was that rare and remarkable thing: a eureka moment. For the past three years, I’d been struggling with a big and frustrating problem. In researching my book Regenesis, I’d been working closely with Iain Tolhurst (Tolly), a pioneering farmer who had pulled off something extraordinary. Almost everywhere, high-yield farming means major environmental harm, due to the amount of fertiliser, pesticides and (sometimes) irrigation water and deep ploughing required. Most farms with apparently small environmental impacts produce low yields. This, in reality, means high impacts, as more land is needed to produce a given amount of food. But Tolly has found the holy grail of agriculture: high and rising yields with minimal environmental harm. He uses no fertiliser, no animal manure and no pesticides. His techniques, the result of decades of experiment and observation, appear to enrich the crucial relationships between crops and microbes in the soil, through which soil nutrients must pass. It seems that Tolly has, in effect, “trained” his soil bacteria to release nutrients when his crops require them (a process called mineralisation), and lock them up when his crops aren’t growing (immobilisation), ensuring they don’t leach from the soil. So why the frustration? Well, Tolly has inspired many other growers to attempt the same techniques. Some have succeeded, with excellent results. Others have not. And no one can work out why. It’s likely to have something to do with soil properties. But what? Not for the first time, I had stumbled into a knowledge gap so wide that humanity could fall through it. Soil is a fantastically complex biological structure, like a coral reef, built and sustained by the creatures that inhabit it. It supplies 99% of our calories. Yet we know less about it than any other identified ecosystem. It’s almost a black box. Many brilliant scientists have devoted their lives to its study. But there are major barriers. Most soil properties cannot be seen without digging, and if you dig a hole, you damage the structures you’re trying to investigate. As a result, studying even basic properties is cumbersome, time-consuming and either very expensive or simply impossible at scale. To measure the volume of soil in a field, for example, you need to take hundreds of core samples. But as soil depths can vary greatly from one metre to the next, your figure relies on extrapolation. This makes it very hard to tell whether you’re losing soil or gaining it. Measuring bulk density (the amount of soil in a given volume, which shows how compacted it might be), or connected porosity (the tiny catacombs created by lifeforms, a crucial measure of soil health), or soil carbon – at scale – is even harder. So farmers must guess. Partly because they cannot see exactly what the soil needs, many of their inputs – fertilisers, irrigation, deep ploughing – are wasted. Roughly two-thirds of the nitrogen fertiliser they apply, and between 50% and 80% of their phosphorus, is lost. These lost minerals cause algal blooms in rivers, dead zones at sea, costs for water users and global heating. Huge amounts of irrigation water are also wasted. Farmers sometimes “subsoil” their fields – ploughing that is deep and damaging – because they suspect compaction. The suspicion is often wrong. Our lack of knowledge also inhibits the development of a new agriculture, which may, as Tolly has done, allow farmers to replace chemical augmentation with biological enhancement. So when I came to write the book, I made a statement so vague that it reads like an admission of defeat: we needed to spend heavily on “an advanced science of the soil”, and use it to deliver a “greener revolution”. While we know almost nothing about the surface of our own planet, billions are spent on the Mars Rover programme, exploring the barren regolith there. What we needed, I argued, is an Earth Rover programme, mapping the world’s agricultural soils at much finer resolution. I might as well have written “something must be done!” The necessary technologies simply did not exist. I sank into a stygian gloom. * * * At the same time, Tarje Nissen-Meyer, then a professor of geophysics at the University of Oxford, was grappling with a different challenge. Seismology is the study of waves passing through a solid medium. Thanks to billions from the oil and gas industry, it has become highly sophisticated. Tarje wanted to use this powerful tool for the opposite purpose – ecological improvement. Already, with colleagues, he had deployed seismology to study elephant behaviour in Kenya. Not only was it highly effective, but his team also discovered it could identify animal species walking through the savannah by their signature footfall. By luck we were both attached, in different ways, to Wolfson College, Oxford, where we met in February 2022. I saw immediately that he was a thoughtful man – a visionary. I suggested a pint in The Magdalen Arms. I explained my problem, and we talked about the limits of existing technologies. Was seismology being used to study soil, I asked. He’d never heard of it. “I guess it’s not a suitable technology then?” No, he told me, “soil should be a good medium for seismology. In fact, we need to filter out the soil noise when we look at the rocks.” “So if it’s noise, it could be signal?” “Definitely.” We stared at each other. Time seemed to stall. Could this really be true? Over the next three days, Tarje conducted a literature search. Nothing came up. I wrote to Prof Simon Jeffery, an eminent soil scientist at Harper Adams University, whose advice I’d found invaluable when researching the book. I set up a Zoom call. He would surely explain that we were barking up the wrong tree. Simon is usually a reserved man. But when he had finished questioning Tarje, he became quite animated. “All my life I’ve wanted to ‘see’ into the soil,” he said. “Maybe now we can.” I was introduced to a brilliant operations specialist, Katie Bradford, who helped us build an organisation. We set up a non-profit called the Earth Rover Program, to develop what we call “soilsmology”; to build open-source hardware and software cheap enough to be of use to farmers everywhere; and to create, with farmers, a global, self-improving database. This, we hope, might one day incorporate every soil ecosystem: a kind of Human Genome Project for the soil. We later found that some scientists had in fact sought to apply seismology to soil, but it had not been developed into a programme, partly because the approaches used were not easily scalable. My role was mostly fixer, finding money and other help. We received $4m (£3m) in start-up money from the Bezos Earth Fund. This may cause some discomfort, but our experience has been entirely positive: the fund has helped us do exactly what we want. We also got a lot of pro-bono help from the law firm Hogan Lovells. Tarje, now at the University of Exeter, and Simon began assembling their teams. They would need to develop an ultra-high-frequency variant of seismology. A big obstacle was cost. In 2022, suitable sensors cost $10,000 (£7,500) apiece. They managed to repurpose other kit: Tarje found that a geophone developed by a Slovakian experimental music outfit worked just as well, and cost only $100. Now one of our scientists, Jiayao Meng, is developing a sensor for about $10. In time, we should be able to use the accelerometers in mobile phones, reducing the cost to zero. As for generating seismic waves, we get all the signal we need by hitting a small metal plate with a welder’s hammer. On its first deployment, our team measured the volume of a peat bog that had been studied by scientists for 50 years. After 45 minutes in the field, they produced a preliminary estimate suggesting that previous measurements were out by 20%. Instead of extrapolating the peat depth from point samples, they could see the wavy line where the peat met the subsoil. The implications for estimating carbon stocks are enormous. We’ve also been able to measure bulk density at a very fine scale; to track soil moisture (as part of a wider team); to start building the AI and machine learning tools we need; and to see the varying impacts of different agricultural crops and treatments. Next we’ll work on measuring connected porosity, soil texture and soil carbon; scaling up to the hectare level and beyond; and on testing the use of phones as seismometers. We now have further funding, from the UBS Optimus Foundation, hubs on three continents and a big international team. Eventually, we hope, any farmer anywhere, rich or poor, will be able to get an almost instant readout from their soil. As more people use the tools, building the global database, we hope these readouts will translate into immediate useful advice. The tools should also revolutionise soil protection: the EU has issued a soil-monitoring law, but how can it be implemented? Farmers are paid for their contributions “to improve soil health and soil resilience”, but what this means in practice is ticking a box on a subsidy form: there’s no sensible way of checking. We’re not replacing the great work of other soil scientists but, developing our methods alongside theirs, we believe we can fill part of the massive knowledge gap. As one of the farmers we’re working with, Roddy Hall, remarks, the Earth Rover Program could “take the guesswork out of farming”. One day it might help everyone arrive at that happy point: high yields with low impacts. Seismology promises to shake things up. George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_dec_05_great-european-bake-off-eu-closer-integration-pop-culture.txt,opinion,2025-12-05,Paula Erizanu,"The Great European Bake-Off: if the EU wants closer integration, how about using pop culture?",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/05/great-european-bake-off-eu-closer-integration-pop-culture,"It was both enjoyable and strange to see the EU enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, present the news on Moldovan TV a couple of months ago. For one thing, she is Slovenian – and she is also a diplomat, not a news anchor. But there she was, announcing that Moldova had made more progress in the last three years than it had in the previous 30, and that negotiations for our country to join the European Union would open soon. It was equally surprising to spot Kos in the Instagram stories of leading Moldovan influencer siblings Emilian and Nina Crețu at the end of August – she had invited them to her house in Brussels for a Moldovan pie-making workshop. Kos even brought together the two heads of Moldova’s biggest Orthodox churches for a meeting, in spite of their mutual animosity. This is not the way we are used to EU officials communicating. The departure from stiff, technocratic speeches is part of EU efforts to involve civil society and the public in the EU’s next enlargement process – a difference from the last phase of expansion, from 2004 to 2013, where only the political elites were involved. If the EU is to create a more harmonious kind of European integration, it needs to meet its citizens on the terrain of everyday life like this. In candidate countries such as Albania, Montenegro and Moldova, EU membership feels like a lifeline. But becoming a member is also an arduous, technical process full of reports and negotiation clusters – it is not easy to make it sexy. In the western Balkans, the process has already been going on for years. At the first meeting of a new EU Enlargement Forum in Brussels in November, the Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, observed that he had been talking about EU accession for so long that he could track the process in the anatomy of his receding hairline. More than 90% of Albanians are keen to join the EU, while in Moldova the figure has varied between 53% and 65% throughout the years. For the majority of Moldovans, EU integration promises peace, prosperity, the rule of law and hope that their children could have a better future. The fears of EU-sceptic Moldovans, rooted in unease about the unknown, are boosted by Russian propaganda saying that EU membership means the loss of tradition, identity and sovereignty, or that local companies will not be able to compete against European giants. One other Kremlin-coined narrative is that the EU is about to collapse, just as the USSR did in 1991, or that the EU simply does not want to integrate Moldova. Why would it need a country of 2.4 million people? In the EU itself, enlargement is probably not especially on the minds of ordinary citizens. Overall, 56% of people within the EU said they believe their country would benefit from further enlargement. Tellingly, the same Eurobarometer survey found about two-thirds of EU citizens said they did not feel well informed about the process. Among their concerns, migration was at the top. With an ageing population, the EU continues to need more migrant workers: a labour force often drawn from poorer EU members or candidate states. If we are going to create a more perfect union, we cannot see these people as mere economic units, just human resources to be exploited. If the EU wants the free movement of people to lead to genuine cultural exchanges and human connections, and to stronger European identity and solidarity, it must ensure workers have help to learn the language of their host countries. It is hard to feel fully comfortable living in a country where you don’t speak the language. One theory about the Romanian diaspora’s drift to the far right attributes it to their cultural isolation in their new homes – where social lives exist only through smartphones and sometimes in local Romanian churches. Instead of leaving integration to the labour market and the individual, the EU should encourage people changing countries to take on language classes, perhaps through their employers. One thing more Europeans should do, in the season of Christmas parties, is to invite cleaners, security staff and everyone else working in our offices who may feel invisible to celebrate together, to have a drink and ask them about their lives. These people are usually left out, they are often from other countries, and a small gesture like this can make them feel so much more respected and welcome. Beyond the better integration of migrant workers, if the EU wants to create a stronger and more inclusive European identity, it needs to learn from and compete with Russia’s use of soft power through the entertainment industry. Russian comedy shows like KVN (in which the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy once starred), or the weekly figure-skating programme Ice Age, have been hugely popular – not just in Russia, but across the former Soviet world. Major events like Eurovision and the Champions League may bring Europeans together, but it should not end there. We need more blockbuster shows: what about Europe’s Got Talent, The Voice of Europe, European Top Gear, or The Great European Bake-Off? Why can’t these be broadcast in every EU member and candidate state? If the EU truly wants to get its citizens more involved in processes that once only concerned governments, it needs to drop its dry bureaucratic culture and create more genuine bridges between us – through language, through storytelling, and through the unifying power of culture.

commentisfree_2025_dec_05_labour-supporters-child-poverty-honest-about-brexit.txt,opinion,2025-12-05,Gaby Hinsliff,Give credit where it’s due: Labour is finally doing things its supporters actually want,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/05/labour-supporters-child-poverty-honest-about-brexit,"What does it take for a small child not to recognise their own name? I’ve been thinking about that for days, since reading the Local Government Association’s recent report on a growing crisis in early childhood. We’ve known for a while about children starting school still in nappies, or speaking in Americanisms absorbed from hours stuck in front of YouTube, or even struggling to sit upright because they’ve spent too long slumped over an iPad to develop core muscles. So sadly, it’s not surprising to read of early-years workers telling the LGA they see more and more pre-schoolers who can barely speak, play with others or contain their rage when things don’t go their way. But it was the practitioner who noted that some children “don’t seem to respond to their name” who got to me. You have to wonder how often that child hears a loving adult trying to get their attention. Too often, another practitioner said, “children are not spoken to at home, but offered screens all day” – at mealtimes, out shopping, or in the car – with parents seemingly scared of provoking tantrums if they take the phone away. The report describes a complex puzzle with multiple causes: poverty, and the parental exhaustion that comes of a hardscrabble life; growing up in a pandemic; changes in early-years provision; and way too much screen time. It can’t be solved by money alone, but certainly won’t be solved without it. So a two-pronged strategy of lifting the two-child limit on children’s welfare payments – as Rachel Reeves did last week – and intervening early where toddlers aren’t meeting their milestones makes sense. The Best Start family hubs rolling out gradually nationwide will, we learned this week, get Send (special educational needs and disabilities) co-ordinators, focusing particularly on speech and language. They’ll promote the upcoming National Year of Reading to wean kids off screens and on to books, and more generally attempt, on a shoestring, to mimic the support that their predecessor programme Sure Start once offered parents. There’s not enough funding – there never is – but there are the beginnings of joined-up thinking, accepting that tackling problems in nursery rather than in primary school is easier, cheaper and kinder on everyone involved. Let’s not tempt fate, given this government’s unparalleled ability to take one step forward and three back. But for the record: taxing the better-off in the budget to invest in tackling child poverty, telling some home truths about the economic damage done by Brexit (as Keir Starmer also did this week), and striking a zero-tariff deal on pharmaceuticals with Donald Trump to save a lot of jobs isn’t a terrible week at the office. More surprisingly, for the first time in ages Labour is talking about things its supporters actually like. Jobs! Europe! Children not going hungry! Evidently there has been a disturbance in the force. Westminster rumour has it that the Morgan McSweeney tendency inside government – focused on wining voters back from Reform – is currently being out-argued by those more worried about losing them to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Who knows whether this will last, or what this will do to their electoral fortunes, so for once let’s stay focused on those at the sharp end. The biggest budget winners in terms of net income, the Resolution Foundation thinktank notes, were the poorest 10%; the biggest losers were the richest 10%. Strip away all the fuss about who leaked what to whom, and there’s the gist: Reeves raised money mostly from the better off and spent it mostly on poorer families. She got there inelegantly but she got there, and now there will be children waking up tomorrow who won’t suffer the lifelong harms of early deprivation. At the time of writing, the government’s imminent child poverty strategy is still under wraps, but children’s charities were unanimous that it would be pointless without scrapping the two-child limit. That’s done. What remains is to tell a compelling human story about how children’s lives will change as a result of all that public money, to make people feel it’s worth it. Of course Nigel Farage will say Labour is whacking up taxes for no good reason. But he backed the lifting of the cap this summer, and Reform has problems of its own. For all its meteoric rise in the polls, it has struggled to break the 30% ceiling – a nice problem to have, admittedly, when you’re still miles ahead of the two supposedly big parties, but 30% isn’t enough to win an election. Hence renewed speculation that Reform will merge with the Tories, which would indeed make sense electorally – if only so many of those involved didn’t hate each other. Meanwhile both Labour and Tory strategists have noticed that Reform’s vote share seemingly falls a bit when the economy is uppermost in people’s thoughts, and rises when immigration is. When the battle is over tax and how to spend it, or where new jobs are coming from, Reform isn’t clear what it wants to say and so loses ground to the Tories. The striking thing about watching Kemi Badenoch pummel Rachel Reeves in parliament last week was how it left Farage oddly out in the cold. Let’s not get carried away here. The chancellor’s path remains strewn with landmines – including a revolt brewing among rural Labour MPs over the increasingly toxic farm inheritance tax – and this administration’s capacity for self-destruction is prodigious. But when a Labour government actually delivers some of what its supporters were screaming for, it’s churlish not to acknowledge it. Sometimes, you just have to take yes for an answer.

sport_2025_dec_04_majestic-joe-root-glory-down-under-harry-brook-folly-ashes-england-australia.txt,sport,2025-12-04,Barney Ronay,Joe Root is finally a wizard in Aus after Harry Brook’s Bazball scarecrow act,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/04/majestic-joe-root-glory-down-under-harry-brook-folly-ashes-england-australia,"In the end even the celebration was perfect, out there under that strange deep-blue southern sky, in the frenzy of the game-state – manic Baz energy, England’s lower order scything away death cult-style at the other end, the way even the grass seems lacquered and glazed by the lights. So yeah. All that stuff. In the middle of this Joe Root guided the ball away through fine leg to complete his first Test hundred in Australia, then marked it with a gentle smile and a wave of the bat, no fist-punching, no monkeys off backs, no angsty and pointed messaging. But, then if you know, you know. Imagine trying to explain to someone who hasn’t followed the story why this was not just warm, uplifting and cathartic, but quietly epic, a moment caught for ever in its own square of space and light. A man who already had 39 hundreds in this starchy formal dance of a sport has now scored his 40th. But follow the story, the craft, the jags in the road, the pieces this thing takes out of you along the way. And at the end of it you have one of those great self-contained sporting moments, the sense of emotional connection through all the surrounding hoopla, the way Test cricket in particular can make you feel you know someone intimately just by watching them move and work and fail and come back. There will, of course, be plenty of banter-war stuff to be resolved on all sides now. Is Joe Root finally great? Is he Australian great? Do we have enough? Numbers. Symmetry. Completion. Men in sheds stroking their beards and sighing. At times cricket really does feel like nothing more than lists, pencil stubs, a fussicky ticking of boxes. But there is something more about wanting Root to be great in Australia. It’s not about one-upmanship, or the chance to gloat, to countermand David Warner’s latest thought-blurt. Any Australian who knows about cricket already knows Root is a great cricketer. But you want them to see it too, and to feel it, in the way you want people to love a band you love, or a book or a place. Joe Root being great in Australia. Win or lose, this ennobles everyone’s Ashes. Although, having said that, and if there’s still any slight chance, we do still want to see Matthew Hayden naked. Root’s hundred felt significant in other ways, not least as something solid in the series for this team, a handhold in the glacier, even a basic freeing up. Are England going to win at the Gabba? Don’t know. But Joe Root got a hundred. Did Harry Brook play if not the worst shot of all time, then perhaps the worst shot yet? Yes. He did. Brook was once again tediously conventional in his attempts at being wild and free, not so much punk rock, more the cricket equivalent of David Cameron listening to The Smiths. But Joe Root did also score a hundred. And not just a hundred in Australia, but a brilliant one in genuinely tough conditions, and an innings that might just have saved his team in this series. There were moments of escalation and gear change. After three hours of furious focus Root could be seen whirling himself inside out to produce an outrageous reverse swat over what was now deep fine leg, moving his score to 128 off 194 balls with all the carefree elan of a man hurling a television set out of a 19th floor hotel window, and teeing up the 50 partnership for the last wicket with Jofra Archer as the day started to melt a little and ooze England’s way. Although, naturally, it had to start with the wings already falling off, the drinks trolley floating past his ear, and England’s greatest modern player coming out at two wickets down for five runs. Root was dropped early in the slips by Steve Smith. From there he was into his most ferrety mode, counterattacking with such gentle grace you hardly noticed as he glided into the twenties alongside Zak Crawley, driving stiff legged at everything in his arc, like a guardsman playing croquet. By mid-afternoon England were 175 for three and poised at the jumping off point. Two versions of elite Yorkshire-dom at the crease. Vice-captain and ex-captain. Numbers one and two in the world. And so the question was asked again. Can they be ruthless here? The answer to which was, of course, no. At one end Root was simply being himself, easy, lithe, watchful, killing you softly, working out in real time how to play these angles and this set of lines. At the other one Brook was batting like a man who desperately needs the bathroom, batting like Lord Farquharson swishing at the dandelions with his walking stick. All the while a darkness was coming, shadows creeping across the ground, Brisbane turning a lovely soft green, and the pink ball genius, Mitchell Starc, revving up for the key spell of the day. Do you run towards this danger? Yep. You do. No sighters, no feet. Just throw the hands at it first up. Trust talent, trust vibes. The ball to Brook was full, the edge thick. There is no world where this was a good choice, no cool-guy dynamic where it makes sense. Australia had pretty much handed Brook a cue card. This is a plan. Would you like to be part of it? Oh, you would? It was at least novel in its abjectness. We have seen England bat in Australia like the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz, stiff and brittle with no heart. We’ve seen them bat like the Lion, without a spleen. Now Brook gave us the scarecrow, batting without a brain. We are the stuffed men. We are the hollow men. We are an attitude, a set of slogans. And so one half of this England team continued to collapse in stages, while at the other end Root batted not just for his life, but for everyone else’s too. There is at times something exhilarating about watching this, the lack of care, the let-the-world-burn energy. But it is also increasingly tedious in the refusal to learn, develop, find new things. Chances are being wasted here. We could have been anything that we wanted to be, with all the talent we had. But we decided, a fact we take pride in. We became the best at being bad. Root provided his own quiet rebuke, a triumph for doing your homework, working at your flaws, a hundred off 181 balls, 35 off his last 19 as the day demanded it. England are still in this series because he did the thing, scaled his own final peak, offered a lesson in what talent ultimately means. Are they going to bowl Australia out now, turn things around? Are they going to learn, to become more Bazball with brains, which is, in the end, not really Bazball at all? Not sure. But Joe Root did score a hundred."
sport_2025_dec_04_marco-odermatt-ryan-cochran-siegle-beaver-creek-downhill-world-cup.txt,sport,2025-12-04,Guardian sport and agencies,US skier Ryan Cochran-Siegle kicks off Olympic push with Beaver Creek downhill podium,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/04/marco-odermatt-ryan-cochran-siegle-beaver-creek-downhill-world-cup,"Marco Odermatt of Switzerland won the downhill season-opener Thursday, beating American Ryan Cochran-Siegle in a World Cup race on a tricky but shorter Birds of Prey course. Odermatt finished in 1min 29.84sec to surpass Cochran-Siegle by .30sec. Norway’s Adrian Smiseth Sejersted finished third. The finish line was moved up the hill – and just barely visible by fans in the stands – due to a lack of snow to properly place the safety netting. The 11th race on the course, Odermatt said he was able to attack the steeper sections and carry enough speed through the flatter part. “For me, a perfect race,” Odermatt said. These days, when isn’t it a perfect race for him? Odermatt has won the last two overall World Cup downhill titles. He’s been consistent in the event and hasn’t finished outside of the top seven in a World Cup downhill race since 2023. This was his fifth World Cup downhill win. Odermatt also started the World Cup super-G season with a Thanksgiving win at nearby Copper Mountain. “How do you catch him? I don’t know,” Cochran-Siegle said of Odermatt, who’s won the last four overall World Cup crowns. “I think the rest of the world’s still trying to figure that out.” Cochran-Siegle spent some time in the leader’s box after a smooth run. He’s the first American to be on a World Cup downhill podium in Beaver Creek since Steven Nyman finished third in 2014. The last American racer to win a World Cup downhill at Beaver Creek was Bode Miller in 2011. “It’s cool to stand among those legends,” said Cochran-Siegle, a silver medalist in the super-G at the 2022 Beijing Games. Cochran-Siegle, 32, is the newest standard-bearer of one of American skiing’s most enduring families. The son of 1972 Olympic slalom champion Barbara Cochran, he grew up on the family’s small ski area outside Burlington, Vermont, where generations of Cochrans have learned the sport. He began his career as a promising giant slalom specialist before shifting his focus to the speed events, steadily carving out a place on the World Cup circuit. His path has also been shaped by resilience. Cochran-Siegle has endured a series of serious setbacks – including a major knee injury that required multiple surgeries and a broken neck that threatened to end his career – only to return stronger each time. He claimed his first World Cup victory in 2020 in his 101st start and stunned the field in the Olympic super-G three years ago. Over recent seasons he has become one of the tour’s more consistent performers in downhill and super-G, recording 28 top-10 finishes across the two disciplines. Sejersted notched his first World Cup podium in the downhill. He has two other podium finishes in super-G. His Norwegian teammate, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, finished in 11th place as he took another big step in his return from a serious crash. This was Kilde’s first downhill race since his crash in January 2024. Kilde underwent surgery for a severe cut and nerve damage in his right calf and two torn ligaments in his shoulder. “I’m super happy with how I could control things today,” said Kilde, who also competed in the super-G on Thanksgiving. “I can’t be more satisfied with the feeling that I had in the finish.” Rok Aznoh of Slovenia had a scary crash near the end of the race. He was taken to the hospital to evaluate head and knee injuries. Earlier in the day, organizers announced the super-G race would be moved to Friday with the weather forecast not looking favorable for Saturday. There’s a giant slalom event scheduled for Sunday."
sport_2025_dec_05_nodirbek-abdusattorov-overwhelms-rivals-london-classic-chess.txt,sport,2025-12-05,Leonard Barden,Abdusattorov overwhelms rivals at Arsenal but England hit back in style,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/05/nodirbek-abdusattorov-overwhelms-rivals-london-classic-chess,"This week’s XTX London Classic at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium took place in an elegant arena with a full view of the football pitch. The English players suffered for most of the event, but hit back in style on Thursday when all four won their eighth-round games. Scores after eight of the nine rounds were Nodirbek Abdusattorov (Uzbekistan) 7, Alireza Firouzja (France) 5, Nikita Vitiugov (England) 4.5, Luke McShane and Michael Adams (both England) 4, Nikolas Theodorou (Greece) and Pavel Eljanov (Ukraine) 3.5, Abhimanyu Mishra (USA) and Gawain Maroroa Jones (England) 3, Sam Shankland (USA) 2.5. The four English victories in Thursday night’s eighth round transformed what had been a difficult event into a demonstration of sustained national strength at the board. Round nine can be watched free and live on Friday (4pm GMT start) with computer commentary on lichess.org or with grandmaster commentary on chess.com. Abdusattorov, 21, demonstrated his skills with a dominant 3000+ tournament rating performance and a feat of memory in a key game. Paired as White in round two with Mishra, the 16-year-old who at 12 set a world record as the youngest ever grandmaster, Abdusattorov faced the rare Arkhangelsk Ruy Lopez, where Black meets 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 by a6, b5, Bb7 and Bc5. The Uzbek GM was fully prepared for it, and for the first 34(!) moves needed only to double-check his analysis while his opponent used his full time allowance. After the game, Abdusattorov showed that Black could have equalised by 20….Re6! instead of 20…h4?, that his 30 Ke3! improved on a previous 2025 game won by Russia’s Alexander Grischuk, and that 34 Ke3! the final move of his deep preparation, was the only way to get a winning position. White’s g and h pawns are decisive, although it still took another 15 moves to get the pair united on the seventh rank and to force Black’s resignation. Abdusattorov summed up: “It’s very easy to misjudge this endgame from a human perspective. That’s how we tend to think as humans, but the engine is merciless.” By round five, when the former tennis star Andy Murray made a ceremonial opening move for him, Abdusattorov’s lead over his main rival Firouzja had already stretched to a full point. The Frenchman, who Magnus Carlsen had predicted back in 2022 to be his successor as world champion, lacked sharpness and conceded several draws to opponents in the lower half of the table. Abdusattorov’s fifth successive win, against Shankland in round six, raised his tournament performance rating to 3050 and was a crushing attack where the American resigned one move before checkmate. When the two leaders met in Thursday’s night’s eighth round, Firouzja chose a rare variation of the Queen’s Gambit Accepted with 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 e4, but got nothing from the opening. Abdusattorov could even have played on at the end with 31….Qg6, but chose to draw by perpetual check to wrap up his tournament victory. The event’s Fide Open included world No 7 Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu, who needed to complete a tournament with 50+ competitors to qualify for next year’s Candidates. He made heavy weather of it, including a round six draw with Velimir Ilic, who accepted a peace offer in a position where 25 Rxe6 Qxe6 26 Qe3! would have given the Serb excellent winning chances. At the end, Praggnanandhaa and Ilic both scored 7.5/9 and shared the £10,000 first prize with GM Ameet Ghasi. The 38-year-old Englishman, who works full-time for Biogen and only achieved his grandmaster title a year ago, scored the best result of his career, a remarkable performance by an amateur who took an eight-year break from chess in his late teens. Ghasi’s decisive final round win against Dan Fernandez was out of the ordinary, too. Fernandez, who ended a point behind the winners but along with Matthew Wadsworth (6.5/9) achieved an elite tournament performance above 2600, went for broke with an early g4-g5 against the ancient Philidor Defence 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 d6. Ghasi responded forcefully, and the critical moment came at move 15 where the unlikely 15 Nd1! would have kept White in the game while 15 Qg3? as played soon led to decisive material loss. Many English junior talents took part in the Fide Open, but none were consistent enough to score GM or IM norms. However, Supratit Banerjee, 11, and Kai Hanache, 13, both maintained their very promising progress with strong tournament rating performances. One of the highlights was a 19-move miniature by IM Jonah Willow, where his 19 Nb5! induced immediate resignation. 4001 1 Rh4+! gxh4 2 Nh6+! Rxh6 3 h3 mate."
sport_live_2025_dec_05_australia-vs-england-live-ashes-second-2nd-test-day-two-aus-v-eng-cricket-scores-updates-gabba-brisbane.txt,sport,2025-12-05,Rob Smyth (now) and Angus Fontaine (earlier),"Australia v England: Ashes second Test, day two – live",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/dec/05/australia-vs-england-live-ashes-second-2nd-test-day-two-aus-v-eng-cricket-scores-updates-gabba-brisbane,"48th over: Australia 244-3 (Smith 35, Green 26) The old ball has been changed, though the England players don’t look particularly impressed with the replacement. Archer bowls a nothing over, his 14th of the innings. England look almost cooked. Almost. “It’s 3.16 am in Minnesota,” says El Rose. “I may have chosen the wrong night to make the effort but it’s tonight or never.” In the words of that great cricket commentator Richie Aprile… [NB: Clip contains adult language] 47th over: Australia 243-3 (Smith 35, Green 26) A maiden from Atkinson to Green, much of it landing halfway down the pitch. Sometimes, bowlers drop short because human beings are not robots and they can’t always land the ball where they want to. But this feels like a deliberate tactic, one that is hard to fathom in the circumstances. O Matt Potts, Where Art Thou? 46th over: Australia 243-3 (Smith 35, Green 26) Jofra Archer returns to the attack. It’s only a partial exaggeration to say this spell is England’s last chance. He bowls a zingy short ball to Smith, who is hopelessly late on a pull stroke and top-edges it over the slips for four. Smith makes a mockery of the previous stroke by leaning back to uppercut for six, a deliberate and utterly brilliant stroke. Quite why England are bowling so short, I know not. There is an argument that, in the face of formidable competition from day two at Perth, England’s performance today has been their worst of the series to date. “I’ve been awake since 5.30am with nerves, not just for the cricket,” writes Sam Charlton in Leeds. “My incredible other half, Siân, is defending her PhD in AI for medical diagnosis and care this morning. So here’s to a successful defence, both in Siân’s PhD viva and England’s first-innings total.” All the best, Siân! Let’s accentuate the positive: England have bowled so poorly that you are guaranteed to mount the most successful defence of the day. (But seriously, we wish you well. And if AI can do anything for plantar fascitis, I’m all ears.) 45th over: Australia 233-3 (Smith 25, Green 26) A good over from Atkinson… until the last ball, which is fractionally short and pulled sweetly over the top for four by Green. Australia are giving England a taste of their own medicine, scoring at 5.17 runs per over. How do you like dem Bazball apples? “Re: over 43 - you’re right, it is boring,” says Felix Wood, “but there’s nothing else that can be said. And it’s not really enforced errors plural - it’s a single unforced error repeatedly. Loose drive to balls on fourth or fifth stump. The most frustrating thing is that it’s not even like it’s relentless pressure from a phalanx of bowlers. “How hard would it have been just to leave Starc’s wide balls until he got tired? He’s a phenomenal bowler, so no doubt he would have exploded some stumps with those yorkers, but at least make him work for his wickets. I’ve even bored myself here. This is what England have reduced me to.” Weird thing is they played so sensibly against Bumrah for most of last summer. Perth and Brisbane are the bounciest pitches so it was always going to be a risky stroke… and I’m boring myself as well. “Oh lord,” says Phil Harrison. “This is the series, right here isn’t it? England have to get this session right. If they do, wickets can fall in clumps under the lights. But man, if they don’t this is going to be a long, bleak few weeks...” At least you can sleep through it. Gus Atkinson replaces Brydon Carse for the first over after tea. He has two slips and a leg slip for Steve Smith. Jake Weatherald, whose rapid 72 set the tone for Australia, chats to Adam Gilchrist Yeah it’s great fun, obviously, a pleasure to be out here. The Gabba’s a great place to bat and the atmosphere for a pink-ball game is awesome. [On his scoring rate] We always like to take the positive approach. They were aggressive with the short-ball stuff; it’s good to play off the back foot at the Gabba so they were a lot of scoring options. [On the pitch] It’s still really good to bat on. As the game goes on, with the heat and everything, I think the cracks will play a part. 44th over: Australia 228-3 (Smith 24, Green 22) With Stokes about to bowl, Smith pulls away due to the presence in his eyeline of a bearded fella in a gold rugby shirt, proudly clutching a plastic glass of 3.7% ABV Liver Compromiser, totally oblivious to his impact. AFter four dot balls, Smith cover-drives for three with a flourish. Stokes is blowing. He ends the over, and the sessioon, with a wide full toss that is edged safely for four by Green. Australia have their foot on England’s throat. They trail by just 114 and could take a decisive grip on the turn this evening. England’s bowlers were better than in the first session but still nowhere near their forensic performance in the first innings at Perth. They could be about to enter a world of pain. 43rd over: Australia 221-3 (Smith 21, Green 18) Carse is straining to get the ball fuller, the right thing to do on this pitch. When he overcompensates, an occupational hazard, Green drives crisply thorugh extra cover for three. He’s looked good so far. Smith looks anonymous, which is kind of ominous for England; he moves into the twenties with a squirt through point. The ball isn’t doing a huge amount, and England won’t be getting a new one tonight. It’s important that England fans don’t get carried away; equally, it’s reasonable to suggest that IT’S ALL OVER KAPUT FINITO THREE YEARS’ PLANNING AND THE WHOLE BLOODY THING IS DONE AND DUSTED INSIDE FOUR DAYS I CAN’T TAKE ANY MORE DISAPPOINTMENT YOU CAN FIND SOME OTHER SUCKER TO DO 2029-30 I’LL BE AT A DIGITAL RETREAT ON THE KERGUELEN ISLANDS if they have a bad final session, the Ashes will almost certianly be staying in Australia. I know it’s boring, but the biggest difference in this series to date is that Australia’s batters have made fewer unforced errors. “Soupçon,” says Patrick O’Brien. “I mean, yeah, well done using that word correctly and all. But admit it, you always say it out loud as ‘soup can’.” Au contraire, I tend to go for the full, Amelie-style ‘Monsieur Quincampoix’. Possibly a cancellable offence these days. But it’s done with love! 42nd over: Australia 215-3 (Smith 18, Green 15) Another boundary, though there was nothing wrong with the bowling this time. Stokes squared up Green, who got a thick edge through the slips. Stokes effs and jeffs at the batter, prompting this exchange on commentary Ebony Rainford-Brent I think Stokes was fuming. Alastair Cook [deadpan] Can you lipread, Ebony? You had to be there. Maybe it’s an alpha/allrounder thing but Stokes’ intensity seems to go up a notch when he bowls to Green. That and his F-word percentage. 41st over: Australia 209-3 (Smith 17, Green 10) Duckett makes a fine diving stop in the covers when Green punches a drive off Carse. A better over from Carse, with nothing too short; a maiden in fact. England are back in it! “I’m currently following the OBO while sitting alongside my wife’s hospital bed, as she gave birth to our daughter Audrey at 11am this morning,” writes DanieL McDonald. “Mother and child are doing amazingly well, making me somewhat redundant. The first cricket game I attended was with my dad, the first day of the 1990 Ashes Test in Brisbane, where England were bowled out before stumps and squandered a good match position with a third-innings capitulation (familiar?). I won’t foist it upon her, but maybe Audrey’s first match will an Ashes Test in the new Brisbane Olympic stadium? Whatever comes her way in this crazy mixed up world, I hope she finds something that brings her as much pleasure as Test cricket, and especially the OBO, has for me. Thank you.” Aww, many congratulations to Daniel, Audrey and the unnamed Mrs McDonald. And thank you for reminding us of Brisbane 1990. Peter Bloody Cantrell. 40th over: Australia 209-3 (Smith 17, Green 10) It’s mildly bonkers that a player of Green’s quality hasn’t scored a century in a home Test. This is his 17th, with his highest score the punishing 84 he made against India at Sydney in his debut series. He demonstrates his abuindant class with a beautiful extra-cover drive for four off Stokes. Right, come on down and let’s play a game of spot the differences. Australia, 1st innings of first Test 132 all out (2.91 runs per over) Australia, since then 414 for 5 (6.06 runs per over) 39th over: Australia 204-3 (Smith 17, Green 5) Smith mistimes a pull off Carse so badly that the ball drops right in front of him; at the same time Carse falls over in his delivery stride. Elite cricket, the best of the best. “England should have had a go with Josh Tongue, an expert in removing the tail but also taking wickets further up,” says John Starbuck. “Carse and Atkinson are both adequate in most cases but rather too similar as well, with not enough variation between them. Given that we can now rely on Archer to strengthen the tail, the others’ failures in three innings loom larger.” I’ve never thought of Carse and Atkinson as being similar, but Tongue is certainly a point of difference. So is Potts, whose fuller length and ability to make the batters play would have been valuable on this pitch. He also gets good players out, right-handers especially, and was all over Smith in the ODI series in 2024. Either way, I don’t love the selection of Jacks. Would’ve made sense in a low-scoring dogfight, but not this. 38.2 overs: Australia 200-3 (Smith 14, Green 4) A ripper from Carse hits Smith on the elbow, the same blow he landed at Perth. Smith wrings his hand in pain and then receives treatment; it’s not quite Graham Gooch at Trinidad in 1990 but he’s not enjoying the physio’s poking and prodding. Eventually the pain subsides and he takes guard again. 38th over: Australia 200-3 (Smith 14, Green 4) Cam Green is Australia’s new No5. That was well bowled by Stokes – close to the length Jason Gillespie spoke about a moment ago, with a soupçon of away movement to find the edge. You’d imagine Stokes will settle into a marathon spell at this end, especially if he can get the ball moving under lights. I think he fancies Green too, having set him up beautifully in the first innings at Perth. Green punches a handsome drive that is very well stopped at mid-off by Archer. But he gets off the mark next ball, tucking an errant delivery to the fine leg boundary. England have been spitting out four-balls today. Eeeeeesh, how England needed that. Labuschagne tries to force a good ball from Stokes and gets the thinnest of edges that is well caught by the tumbling Smith. The end of a terrific, quietly forceful innings from Labuschagne, whose 65 came from only 78 balls. Josh Hazlewood is a doubt for the rest of the series after suffering another setback. At this rate, Australia will be able to play him as a specialist batter for the last two Tests. 37th over: Australia 196-2 (Labuschagne 65, Smith 14) Last winter I stayed up into the small hours and watched Brydon Carse bowl like a dream against New Zealand. He was forensic, intimidating, insistent, and he looked like a banker for this series. Alas, today he is bowling pure, unadulterated filth – and not the good kind. The first ball of his eighth over is short on leg stump, and you’ll never guess what Labuschagne does with it?!?! You betcha: a pull round the corner for four more. Tihs is another reason England needed five bowlers, as insurance for somebody having an off day. Two sides to every story, though, and Labuschagne in particular is playing with clarity and ruthlessness. Smith cuts for three to bring up the fifty partnership. Even Jason Gillespie, one of the most empathic, gentle and polite people in cricket, is going off on one in the commentary box about the performance of attacks in this game. “At Perth and Brisbane,” he says, “you want to bowl as short as you can while still getting the batsmen to come forward. In the modern game I’m seeing a lot of impatience.” 36th over: Australia 189-2 (Labuschagne 58, Smith 14) Stokes replaces Archer. His first ball is too short and pulled easily round the corner for four by Labuschagne. England picked the wrong attack – Matt Potts should have played, mainly to bowl to this pair – and have doubled down by bowling really poorly. But apart from that it’s been an unmitigated triumph. In other news, this, from Chris Paraskevas, is an early contender for my favourite email of the 2025-26 Ashes. G’day Rob. Hope you’re well! (I am properly pi$$ed.) Quintessential gorgeous Sydney day today peaking at around 35 degrees celcius in the arvo. Had the Xmas work function off and the afternoon was shaping up to be an absomur3 disastwr when I realised I was the obly one hitting the turps (going at a strike rate of three drinks an hour) and then to top it off- The Old Fitzroy pub literally ran out of burgers (this is afrer I clweayrly saw thwir chef cooking 8 burgers when I accidentally walked into the kitchen lookingnfor the dunny). Anyway long story ahort / sober: had to make do with fish and chips (doesn’tr really absorb the alcohol but that’s a grwat rhing upon reflection) At one point I averted complete catastrophe when the bartender came to remove my empty glass - only to realize I had the MBM and a stream of the game fired up and the phone rreasted against the glass. Might hit the Bottle-O and keep the party going all night, this game is actually going to g0 past 2 dayz (m??+?!?!?!?!?). How good is life inn Australia / the permanent shadow of the pub!?“PS. England bowlint .... bad. Just say no, kids. (Btw you can see Chris’s short film here. It’s not about his Christmas party.) 35th over: Australia 182-2 (Labuschagne 51, Smith 14) England’s Carse has taken a serious spanking, with 54 runs coming from his first six overs. Labuschagne gets four more with a top-edged pull over the keeper’s head – and those runs take him to a vital half-century from only 67 balls. He’s back. Smith forces two more later in the over. Carse’s figures would look a bit grisly in an ODI, never mind a Test: 7-0-61-1. Thanks Angus, hello everyone. We’re about to enter the twilight zone, and unless England have a very good second half of the day, the Ashes hopes of this team will never be seen again. The next few hours are positively Brobdingnagian. As the sun sets on Brisbane, Jofra needs a spell and so do I. Time to hand the pink pill of the OBO to Rob Smyth and bid you all adieu. Enjoy the twilight zone, folks! 34th over: Australia 175-2 (Labuschagne 46, Smith 12) Archer continues and immediately draws an edge from Labuschagne’s dropping hands. It falls well short of the slips though. Third ball is slower and fades down leg-side where Marnus helps it along with a gentle caress that steers it past the fielder at fine leg for FOUR. I’m surprised Archer hasn’t been spelled here. he is clearly tiring and has shown signs of a side strain. Is Stokes taking unnecessary risks with his strike weapon? Or has he simply got nowehere else to turn? An email from Stephen Holliday thinks “there’s something quite nostalgic about all this. An utterly toothless England with no ideas other than to huff and puff and get burnt foreheads, and an Ashes series over on the morning of the fourth day of play. It’s like before Trump. Before social media. Before the internet. Endless summers without a care in the world. Really happy days. I approve!” 33rd over: Australia 170-2 (Labuschagne 41, Smith 12) Change of bowling as Atkinson gives way to Carse… and Ben Stokes issues a snarl straight away as he’s forced to Atkinson’s stop skew off the boot and gifts Smith two runs from the misfield. Smudge takes another two from the fourth, a leg-side no-ball, and then drives FOUR through mid-on from the last as Carse continues to leak runs. 32nd over: Australia 161-2 (Labuschagne 41, Smith 4) Archer enters his 11th over, the most of any England’s bowlers and the most frugal too. He’s going for just 2.36 per over and has the wicket of Jake Weatherald to his name. Given their history, Smith and Labuschagne seem happy to wait Archer out and attack the change bowler. Will Stokes risk Carse again, despite him giving up nine an over? He’ll have to roll the dice because Archer looks done and Labuschagne lifts him for SIX over fine leg to prove it. 31st over: Australia 155-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 4) Australia’s run-rate has dropped to 5.11 since Weatherald’s exit and Atkinson is slowly turning the screws on Smith, delivering a maiden. Looks like Archer is going to keep this spell going. England are going for broke. 30th over: Australia 155-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 4) Breathe easy, England fans. Jofra Archer has resumed his spell and his first ball is 139kph, still a good clip. Smith lets it pass down leg-side but he pulls the second square and steals a run. Archer tosses down a 146kph bumper and Labuschagne ducks it, rising with an impish grin. 29th over: Australia 154-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 3) Footage on air now is showing Archer in consultation with the England physio on the boundary. He’s staying on but looks to be stretching out his flanks. Atkinson is still rolling at the other end, faster and tighter than in the first session. He draws an ugly flash from Labuschagne first ball that sends Marnus back into his shell for the rest. A maiden ensues. 28th over: Australia 154-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 3) Archer is still delivering at 140kph but seems to be tiring a little. Smith works an overpitched ball for three and then another full one gets lashed through the covers by Labuschagne. Seven from the over. 27th over: Australia 147-2 (Labuschagne 30, Smith 0) The Old Firm of Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne reunite following Jake Weatherald’s departure for an excellent 72. Smith sees off two deliveries from Atkinson, happy to watch awhile. Breakthrough! Great bowling by Jofra Archer. He got clouted for four last ball and sought revenge. He has nailed Jake Weatherald bang in front. No appeals to the third umpire by the batter. He knows he’s gone. And sure enough, replays show it hitting middle stump halfway up. 26th over: Australia 141-1 (Weatherald 68, Labuschagne 29) Marnus steals a single and leaves Archer to Weatherald who is loving life as a Test cricketer. All the more now, as he crunches a late cut to the rope. Strewth, that was brutal. He took it off the third rib and it rocketed to the boundary. But Archer’s reply is a yorker and it’s got past the bat and thundered into the pads. Big shout! 25th over: Australia 141-1 (Weatherald 68, Labuschagne 29) Gus Atkinson’s girded loins continue to deliver tighter lines but minimal threat. He’s throwing them down at 137kph and angling it back in at the stumps. It’s all going well until Weatherald steps back and cuts like a knife behind point for FOUR. Guy Hornsby doesn’t like what the new dawn has delivered in the UK but, like all stoic Poms, is looking on the bright side: “Well that’s a sobering score to wake up to Angus! But we’ve been here many times before. England bowled 2nd XI stuff in the first session, but you have to hope they’ll have had a bit of a talking to in the break. And looking at how they’re coming out so far, it seems to have worked. There’s a really long way to go and we have the lights to come, so we are still right in this, we just have to bring the stumps into play. And pray.” 24th over: Australia 137-1 (Weatherald 64, Labuschagne 29) As Archer rolls to the crease, Jake Weatherald begins mouthing mantras. Lip readers, please write in to tell me what he’s saying to himself. Or is he just pouting and pussing like Mick Jagger? Whatever he’s doing, it’s working and he’s having fun out there. He clips Archer for another single as Australia take their target under 200. 23rd over: Australia 133-1 (Weatherald 61, Labuschagne 28) Atkinson has been given a fresh spin. His first four overs went at almost six an over but he yields just a single to each batter here. Perhaps tea has girded his loins for the new session? Darryl Accone is following from South Africa: “At lunch at the Gabbatoir, the best-laid plans of Bazzers and men lie in waste after Australia’s Baz-like start to their innings. It’s good to see cricketing intelligence whip cricketing inflexibility, to see respect for fundamentals trump the self-hypnotising mantras of a mindless cult.” 22nd over: Australia 131-1 (Weatherald 60, Labuschagne 27) Jofra Archer enters his sixth with 0-9: frugal figures but he’s paid to make breakthroughs. Weatherald works him for a single but Archer responds with a good line outside off to Labuschagne. Tight bowling but England need aggression from Archer. Players are taking the field for the second session of this pink ball Test. Jofra Archer looks full of beans (perhaps, literally) and is pawing at the ground like a wolf watching a rabbit on the horizon. Mind you, so is Jake Weatherald. He has thumped 59 from 56 for his first Test half-century and looks hungry for more. Here we go… With England reeling and Australia rolling, Stephen Smith is keeping calm rather than carrying on: “We’ve had a horribly traditional first innings 334 with a big score from the big man [the 183cm Joe Root] (his red inker and subsequent 70-odd average soothes me). And now top order runs in reply. Take away the run rate and this just has too much of a feel of an actual Test match. Where’s the flash where’s the pizzazz where’s the chutzpah? Hopefully Jamie Smith emerges after lunch with his hard cricket replaced by an e scooter helmet to get this all back off track.” Tom Banks isn’t quite as hopeful and asks. “Too late to fly out Jimmy?” Advantage Australia. The home side still trail by over 200-runs but on the evidence of that session they will reach and breach that target before the day is out. England may have edged day one and piled a few more runs onto an entertaining 10th-wicket partnership this morning, but they have dropped their bundle on day two through loose bowling, a dropped catch and abysmal body language. As Brian Withington writes in from Blighty under the gloomy headline ‘Fill Your Boots’: “The generosity of most of our batters has been surpassed by the bowlers, with a smorgasbord of long hops spiced with the occasional half volley. Bon appetit!” Joe Root’s unbeaten 138 was magnificent but Australia have erased it in a session. Can the visitors recover their mojo after lunch and give themselves a sniff of squaring the series? Or will Australia pile on the runs and rain down more misery? Time to grab a bite and wet the whistle. We’ll be back in halfa. 21st over: Australia 130-1 (Weatherald 59, Labuschagne 27) Stokes enters his sixth over with 0-32. He should be working on his lunchtime speech instead. It will need to be Henry V-at-Agincourt-esque to get England up for the second session. They are flatter than the Barmy Army choir right now. The run-rate is 6.19 and rising and both batters are set, stealing singles at will and slapping every loose ball to the rope. 20th over: Australia 125-1 (Weatherald 57, Labuschagne 25) Good change-up, England. Spinner Will Jacks is into the attack. Can he add a little more egg to the face of Australian selectors who left their own spin champion Nathan Lyon out of the XI? Not immediately he cant. First ball beats everyone and runs for four byes. Ouch. Now another FOUR as Weatherald taps a legside drifter to the rope with ease. A cut square yields another single. Jack now delivers a rank full toss and Labuschagne bludgeons it down the ground for yet another boundary. 19th over: Australia 112-1 (Weatherald 52, Labuschagne 21) Since the dismissal of Travis Head, Australia have actually accelerated. This Labuschagne-Weatherald partnership is now worth 32 from as many balls and England look in the doldrums. They have given up 16 boundaries 18 overs and lunch cannot come soon enough. Stokes is trying to lead from the front but this Gabba pitch looks to be flattening. 18th over: Australia 109-1 (Weatherald 50, Labuschagne 20) FOUR more for Weatherald as his hip clip yields an eighth boundary. That is a terrible ball first up from Carse. And now the Tassie tiger doubles the dose, lifting Carse over slips. One bounce, over the fence. Australia’s 100 is up in just the 18th over. And now Jake Weatherald pulls sweetly for his FIRST TEST FIFTY. Well played, young man! That half century came from just 45 balls and featured nine fours and six. Now Labuschagne gets in on the action, pulling another short ball to the rope. And now he DOES IT AGAIN, driving down the ground. That’s 17 from the over! 17th over: Australia 92-1 (Weatherald 41, Labuschagne 12) Weatherald works a single to maintain his strike-rate of 100. He continues to look the part at Test level. Labuschagne is into his 60th Test and now shows why, leaning on a full ball from Stokes and sending it down the ground for FOUR. He takes another two through mid-on to make it eight from the over. 16th over: Australia 84-1 (Weatherald 40, Labuschagne 6) Dangerous leave, Marnie! Carse got that one to duck back and it shaved the off stump. Oohs and Aahs ensue as England bask in the dopamine squirt of Head’s dismissal. That will sober them up a little though. Labuschagne cuts crisply through the slips cordon for FOUR. 15th over: Australia 80-1 (Weatherald 40, Labuschagne 2) Massive bounce for Ben Stokes! And again Labuschagne makes a late decision to shoulder arms and almost comes undone as the ball ricochets off his gloves and narrowly misses the stumps. That’s how Jofra Archer did Marnus in the first innings at Perth. England’s fans are up and about now England have their first, the prized scalp of Travis Head. 14th over: Australia 78-1 (Weatherald 40, Labuschagne 1) Here comes Marnus. After suffering the ignominy of exile as a former No 1 batter in the world, the feisty and eccentric 31-year-old has fought his way back into the baggy green. He showed off a new technique in Perth and carted an unbeaten 51 in the second innings as Head’s wingman to win victory in the first Test. He gets off the mark sharply today. England strike at last! Carse steamed in with a scrambled seam and put it on leg stump. Head swung for the rafters but skied it and Atkinson pouched the chance. England have their first, Labuschagne enters the fray with Australia trailing by 257. 13th over: Australia 77-0 (Head 33, Weatherald 40) Stokes enters his second over. Head steps out to the first ball and slaps him down the ground for FOUR. England are in disarray here, still shoe-gazing after that dropped catch by Smith off Archer. Australia, by comparison, are playing eyes-up cricket. Now Head gets onto his toes to tonk Stokes away for FOUR through midwicket. Real danger signs for England (and Usman Khawaja) as Australia’s openers light up the Gabba at a 5.92 run-rate. 12th over: Australia 66-0 (Head 22, Weatherald 40) England needed that drinks break. What can they summon after it? Alas, it’s the same slop. Brydon Carse puts the third ball of his second over way short and Weatherald leans back and taps him over the fine leg fence for SIX! Slipshod bowling. Brilliant batting. Gervase Greene from Clovelly writes in to ask if “any batter has ever asked Jofra Archer to remove that chunky gold chain he sports around his neck? While it might offend many fans’ aesthetic sensibilities (including mine), if I were a batsman trying to follow a 140kmh thunderbolt such a glittery jangling distraction would infuriate me.” Gervase, allow me to submit for evidence this salutary tale in which Dean Jones narrowly avoided being scalped by Curtley Ambrose after asking the big fella to remove his armbands… 11th over: Australia 57-0 (Head 20, Weatherald 33) Time for a change, says Ben Stokes as England’s captain brings himself on. He delivers a full bunger straight up and Head feasts, flicking it for three. Stokes gets the next one on a fifth-stump line and the next follows but is shorter. Weatherald squares up and cuts hard. FOUR! England have been loose early here and Australia are making them pay. 10th over: Australia 50-0 (Head 17, Weatherald 29) Weatherald sneaks a single from Atkinson’s first to find a new highest Test score. Head has predictably decided to throw caution to the wind. He swings and misses at two but finds a bit of extra width from the fourth and BANG – it flies over deep backward point for FOUR. That’s Head’s first boundary of the day… but heree’s his second. This one is SIX! A glorious standing slash over slips for a maximum. Head hammers the next one but doesn’t quite time it and settles for three. FIFTY is up for Australia! 9th over: Australia 36-0 (Head 4, Weatherald 28) ALMOST A RUN-OUT! Head punched it into the onside and set off for the run but Ollie Pope swooped and threw and the Australian had to scramble to get back in time. NOW A DROPPED CATCH! Archer dug it in short and it leapt at Head’s throat, finding a thick edge. Jamie Smith got the gloves up but a fraction too late and it bounced off his thumb and fell to ground. Head somehow survives. Wow, that could be a massive moment in this Test match. Head taps a single to think on his second life while Weatherald slashes at Archer’s fifth ball and sends it soaring over the cordon for his sixth boundary. 8th over: Australia 30-0 (Head 3, Weatherald 23) Jake the Snake strikes! Atkinson pitched it up and Weatherald met it with full force, driving powerfully down the ground. Two balls later he finds the rope again, taking this one off middle stump and punching it to the boundary. Now he brings down the hammer again, this time cutting Atkinson through covers. Three boundaries in an over for for Weatherald! 7th over: Australia 18-0 (Head 3, Weatherald 12) Archer stays full to Weatherald who is seeing them well now and works a single with a punched pull. Archer bends his back to ping the next two in short to Head, seeking the ribs. But the man with the moustache takes both off the soup strainer and flicks them away without scoring. Although Joe Root and Jofra Archer found valuable runs for the final wicket, a few critics think they played day two unwisely. “England didn’t take the chance to bowl under lights on Day 1. Sensible. Day 2, third over. Root on strike. Why take the single first ball?” says Gavin Margetson. “Archer is a No.9 or 10, fair enough he’s not an 11. But England’s best chance of winning is if its best batsman spends as much of the 5 days as possible at the crease.” Tony Hughes agrees: “Bazball or whatever we’re calling this unnecessary aggressiveness made no sense here. All Archer had to do was block and play the poor balls, allowing Joe Root to make runs. England cannot go 15 minutes without trying to smash bowlers around. Make it make sense!” 6th over: Australia 17-0 (Head 3, Weatherald 10) Australia are away now. Each batter taps a single from the first deliveries of Atkinson’s third over. Extra bounce on the third and Weatherald flinches as the pink missile finds a crack and flies at his grille. Next ball isn just as fast – 138kph – but benign. Weatherald scampers a single from the last. 5th over: Australia 14-0 (Head 2, Weatherald 8) After 14 balls without a run, Travis Head finally gets off the mark, working Archer off his pads for a quick two runs. Archer has his pace up to 143kph but hasn’t quite nailed the line yet. Now he strays down leg and Head gets his hip on it, to send it skidding away to the fine leg boundary for leg byes. Fifth ball is a beauty, sizzling past the edge and making Head jump. 4th over: Australia 8-0 (Head 0, Weatherald 8) Runs at last! Atkinson is short on the second ball and Weatherald seizes on it, late cutting sweetly to the third man rope. Nice shot and a nerve settler for the 31-year-old in his second Test. Yowzer! Atkinson digs the final ball in even shorter and Weatherald takes it on, top-edging high over the slips. Roots and Smith give chase but it bounces once and goes over for FOUR. 3rd over: Australia 0-0 (Head 0, Weatherald 0) Twelve balls and no runs so far and it’s Archer v Head again. The England firebrand has drawn hints of swing from this day two pitch and is moving the ball across Head at 140kph+ looking to feed his three slips a snick. Head stays circumspect to the first four but steps down to the fifth but flays it straight to square leg. Another dot ball on the last. Three maidens! 2nd over: Australia 0-0 (Head 0, Weatherald 0) Now it’s Jake Weatherald’s turn. He has Gus Atkinson steaming in at him. And straight away the big quick is online, thundering the first delivery into Weatherald’s pads at 137kph and sending the second whistling past off stump. The tattooed Tasmanian had a ixed bag debut. He fell second-ball in the first dig at Perth but showed good signs in the second innings. With Head at the other end, he attacked England’s bowlers and swaggered to 28 while Head plundered his way to a famous century. Second over is another maiden. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Head 0, Weatherald 0) Head takes strike as he did in the first Test, shielding his junior partner and throwing down the gauntlet to England’s bowlers. Archer sprays the first three wide of off-stump and puts the fourth down leg. Head doesn’t waft at any of them. Instead he watches and waits. Finally he gets a straight ball he has to defend. A dot ball follows. Archer delivers a maiden first-up. Here comes Travis Head with Jake Weatherald to open Australia’s innings. Jofra Archer has the fresh pink ball in his hands at the Vulture Street end. What a duel this will be… here we go, folks. That looked a little ominous for Australia as Joe Root and Jofra Archer came out swinging and seized on some sloppy bowling from young Australian fast-bowler Brendan Doggett. But thanks to a magnificent bit of out-fielding by Labuschange, Australia has spared itself further embarrassment and will start their chase early in the day. Joe Root walks off with a wonderful unbeaten 138 from 206 balls and that tenth wicket stand with Archer (38 from 36) spanned 70 runs. How crucial will that wagging English tail be? Archer launches, looking for a six. The ball was back of a length and the big quick spun on his hip and sent it high into the vast outfield of the Gabba. Brisbane boy Marnus Labuschagne saw it coming early and sprinted to meet it, jumping full-length to his right and plucking the catch. Superb grab! England are ALL OUT! 76th over: England 333-9 (Root 137, Archer 38) Mitchell Starc enters the attack. Can he continue his remarkable run of dismissals in the first over of a spell? Archer attacks from the get-go, stepping out to a full delivery and driving handsomely to the rope. Great shot! Starc hangs the next one wider and it wobbles past Archer’s flashing blade. Starc reclaims his line on the next three and Archer is happy to bank his boundary and watch them sail by. 75th over: England 329-9 (Root 137, Archer 34) In his second Test, Doggett was ineffective yesterday, finishing with 0-74. He starts today with a short ball. Root pulls it but finds a fielder. He steers the second one behind square for a single. Jofra Archer adds another run to his highest Test score, swatting another short one. The easy runs for England continue as Root swipes to fine leg. Archer does likewise, ducking and hooking. Four singles, zero threat. Here we go. Brendan Doggett will open the attack for Australia and he’ll be bowling to Joe Root on 135. We have sunny skies in Brisbane and the mercury is currently at its highest level – a toasty 28 degrees. Conditions will start cooling off after the 6.32pm AEST sunset as we enter the “witching hour” of pink ball Tests. Presuming Australia snatch this tenth wicket quickly, where will the home side be by then? Here come the players onto the field… Mitchell Starc might’ve had Ben Duckett’s measure yesterday but his opening partner Zak Crawley did much better. With Joe Root in company, Crawley stood tall for England to pile on a 117-run stand and drag his side out of the abyss of 5 for 2 and stroke them into a position of superiority at 122 for 3. Crawley had carved 76 from 93 balls with 11 fours in 138 minutes before he became Michael Neser’s sole victim. Simon Burnton enjoyed the big man’s bounce-back from his double-duck disaster in the first Test in Perth. Mitchell Starc continued his incredible record of striking in the first over yesterday, sending Ben Duckett on his way from the sixth ball of the Test. It is the 26th time Starc has struck in the first over of a Test innings. England’s Jimmy Anderson is next (19), Kemar Roach (10) and Stuart Broad (nine) follow and New Zealanders Tim Southee (nine) and Trent Boult (nine) are also first-over demolition experts. Starc also got some high praise overnight from the man whose 414 Test wickets he surpassed yesterday. Wasim Akram got his 414 from 104 Tests at 23.62 while Starc has his from 103 Tests at a higher average but a superior strike-rate. England’s fans found some villains of their own, with no less than four of their side – Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Jamie Smith and Brydon Carse – failing to trouble the scorer. Of those donut kings, Max Rushden reserved special scorn for one English batter… It’s impossible to write this without saying the F word repeatedly. Just leave it outside the off stump. Surely there’s been some self-reflection since Perth. Surely. IT ISN’T THERE TO BE HIT. The whole Ashes is disappearing before our eyes. But if you’re English, Joe Root was the rolled gold star of the opening day. Having closely followed Root’s rise and 13,551 runs since his Test debut in 2012, Barney Ronay was happy to rhapsodise about the Yorkie terrier’s rescue job in Brisbane. Follow the story, the craft, the jags in the road, the pieces this thing takes out of you along the way. And at the end of it you have one of those great self-contained sporting moments, the sense of emotional connection through all the surrounding hoopla, the way Test cricket in particular can make you feel you know someone intimately just by watching them move and work and fail and come back. If you’re a hometown supporter, Australia’s selectors were the villains of day one, leaving an “absolutely filthy” Nathan Lyon our of the side to play Gabba specialist Michael Neser, and Mitchell Starc was again the conquering hero. Geoff Lemon paid fitting tribute to the big quick from Penrith who saved his side’s blushes (again) and whose sterling six-for swept him past the 414 dismissals of the great Wasim Akram to make Starc the most prolific left-arm quick of all. In a series supposed to be defined by Australia’s fast-bowling Big Three, he has done the work as the sole member to make the starting line. With one English wicket left to fall and his tally on six for 46, he was on the brink of the remarkable feat of recording career-best figures for the fourth time in less than 12 months. For those who came in late… here’s our blow-by-blow, over-by-over coverage of day one. Hello cricket fans! Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage for day two of the second Test between Australia and England at the Gabba for the 2025-26 Ashes. This match is beautifully poised, with both combatants seizing momentum then letting it slide throughout a gripping opening day. England won the toss and chose to bat but it was Australia who drew first blood, Mitchell Starc working his magic with the rapid-fire dismissals of Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope to have the visitors two wickets down for five runs. Joe Root strode out in the fifth over with a serious salvage mission on his hands. His team were one-nil down in the series, back at Australia’s happiest hunting ground of the “Gabbatoir” and still raw from their drubbing in Perth. But at stumps, Root’s resilience had carved a new legend to lead his side to an improbable 325 for nine. The 34-year-old Yorkshireman had also got the gorilla off his back at last with a maiden century in Australia to join the 39 others he’s amassed around the world across 159 Tests over 13 years.And with the help of Zak Crawley (76 from 93) and Jofra Archer (a dervish 32 from 26 late in the day), Root had hauled his team into ascendancy with an unbeaten 135 from 202. Despite selectors bizarrely benching Nathan Lyon to play a fifth seamer in Michael Neser, Australia entered the final hour of play with their tails up. Starc had another six-for, having seen off Duckett, Pope, Jamie Smith and Brydon Carse for ducks, and Josh Inglis had embarrassed Ben Stokes with a brilliant run-out. But at 264-9, England sucker-punched them, Root and Archer swinging the axe, seeking fast runs or a late-evening lash at the Australian top-order. They got the former, piling on a fifty-run partnership that will continue this morning to salt the wound of Lyon’s non-selection and his largely-ineffectual substitutions. So settle in and buckle up. Play begins at 2pm AEST in Brisbane, 3pm AEDT, 4am GMT."
