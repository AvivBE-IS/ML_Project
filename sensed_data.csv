culture_2025_dec_02_jon-stewart-trump-mri-tim-walz.txt,culture,2025-12-02,Guardian staff,Jon Stewart on Trump claiming not to know about his own MRI: ‘That’s not physically possible’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/02/jon-stewart-trump-mri-tim-walz,"Late-night hosts tore into Donald Trump for his use of an ableist slur and unconvincing attempts to assuage concerns about his cognitive abilities. Jon Stewart As the Thanksgiving spirit gave way to the work week, Jon Stewart tore into the president for using an ableist slur to describe the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz. In a Truth Social post over the weekend, Trump called Walz, who ran against him last year as Kamala Harris’s running mate, “seriously retarded”. “On Thanksgiving?! Are you confusing that with Festivus?” the Daily Show host exclaimed on Monday evening. Days later, asked by reporters if he regretted his remarks, Trump doubled down, saying that there was “something seriously wrong” with the Democratic governor. “Something wrong with him? With him?” Stewart fumed. “You were sitting with your family at Thanksgiving, belly full of turkey and pie, surrounded by the love of your extended crime family, but your initial instinct was to Truth a slur at Tim Walz? And there’s something wrong with him? “The press corps had to spend the whole holiday weekend down at Mar-a-Lago, listening to this brain ooze, and then, they couldn’t even go back home by themselves,” he added. “They had to fly back with this nut and ask him if he wants to clarify any of the nonsense.” In fact, Trump attempted to assuage recurring concerns about his health and cognitive abilities, including a recently revealed MRI scan in October, by claiming that he had “no idea” what part of the body was even scanned. “It was just an MRI,” he said. “What part of the body? It wasn’t the brain because I took a cognitive test, and I aced it.” “That’s not physically possible,” Stewart responded. “To have no idea, it’s not possible. What would you say to the doctor? ‘No no no, don’t tell me. I want to find out at my MRI reveal party.’ “For God’s sakes, man, were you not curious at all?” he continued. “When they laid you down in a tube for a half an hour to 45 minutes, you didn’t want to know what they might be doing? Or did you just think to yourself, ‘What a loud tanning bed’?” Stewart also mocked Trump’s claim that he got a “perfect score” on his MRI. “That’s how they score the MRIs,” Stewart joked. “You either get a big stamp, ‘Perfect,’ or you get in red ink, ‘See me.’” Stephen Colbert “Maga folks are starting to notice that Trump treats them like meat animals,” said Stephen Colbert on Monday’s Late Show, citing a Daily Beast interview with former supporters angry with the president for building a gilded ballroom instead of tackling affordability. “I’ll have you know that the entire purpose of that ballroom is to serve the poor — and they will be delicious,” Colbert quipped. In other news, “Trump celebrated Thanksgiving in his traditional way – with racism,” Colbert quipped, referring to Trump’s anti-immigrant rant on Truth Social from the weekend. “Somewhere in all of that nonsense”, he attacked Minnesota’s immigration policies and used an ableist slur to describe Walz. Walz responded: “Release the MRI results.” Trump then said he would release the results, though he didn’t know what part of the body was scanned. “Uh, here’s a theory: maybe the part that’s broken is the part that’s supposed to know,” Colbert noted. “As per usual, after the president said something, the White House scrambled to justify it,” he continued. And on Monday afternoon, Trump’s staff posted a letter from Trump’s doctor claiming that the MRI was given “because men in his age group benefit from a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health”. “OK, fair enough,” said Colbert. “Men in his age group also benefit from retiring, so … can we write that prescription next?” Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel also blasted Trump for using an ableist slur. “See, he can be presidential when he wants to be!” he joked. “I wonder why he didn’t get that Nobel peace prize. It makes no sense.” As for Trump’s follow-up on Air Force One – emphasizing of Walz that “I think there’s something wrong with him” – Kimmel was blunt: “another bold statement from the president of the eighth grade”. Trump also continued to claim that his approval ratings had never been higher, “which means it’s not just books he can’t read”, said Kimmel. With a negative rating of 60%, “there are gas station bathrooms on Yelp with higher approval ratings than Donald Trump right now.” Kimmel then touched on Trump’s promise to pardon Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras who was sentenced last year to 45 years in prison for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway to the United States”. “Now some have pointed out the unbelievable hypocrisy of Trump, blowing up boats and killing random Venezuelans because he believes there are low-level drug runners in the boats, while simultaneously pardoning a man who sent a million pounds of cocaine to this country,” said Kimmel. “But those people are just haters and losers, you know? Lighten up! “When he was running for president, Trump made it very clear: his top priorities were a) pardoning drug kingpins and b) building a place to ballroom dance,” he added. “Promises made, promises kept.”"
culture_2025_dec_03_late-night-roundup-trump-truth-social.txt,culture,2025-12-03,Guardian staff,Jimmy Kimmel on the Trump administration: ‘They have better-quality cabinets at Ikea’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/03/late-night-roundup-trump-truth-social,"Late-night hosts tore into Donald Trump’s five-hour Truth Social posting spree and his inability to stay awake during cabinet meetings. Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel wasted no time in returning to his favorite target – Donald Trump – on Tuesday evening. “I know I’ve said this before, but for real this time: he went completely off the rails last night,” the host began. “The man who is allegedly running the country banged out an onslaught of posts and reposts in a furious social media blitzkrieg that started at 7.09pm, went nonstop until almost midnight.” In that five-hour span on Monday night, Kimmel noted, the president posted 116 times, at an average of every two minutes. “Do you know how long you have to be on the toilet to post that much?” he laughed. “I mean, what is he eating?” Kimmel then mocked Trump’s press-friendly cabinet meeting on Tuesday, in which he baselessly and impossibly claimed that revenue from his tariffs would lead to the elimination of the US income tax. “Well, he would know – he hasn’t paid income tax in, what, 50 years?” Kimmel noted. “Does anyone believe we’re not going to have income tax to pay? This is like the kid running for student council who promises soda in the drinking fountains. It makes no sense.” During the meeting, Trump also pushed back on a recent New York Times report that he had cut back on public appearances because he’s showing signs of fatigue. “Which is ridiculous. Does this look like a man who is showing signs of fatigue?” Kimmel joked before clips of Trump appearing to fall asleep at the meeting, even dozing off during a presentation by the gravelly voiced Robert F Kennedy Jr. “I mean, if you can sleep through that voice, you are tired. You are fatigued,” he said. “Of course he’s tired – he was up all night posting!” Kimmel then launched into a blistering summary of the Trump cabinet in attendance: “We have a twice-baked RFK Jr, who is now embroiled in a sex-and-drug scandal with a reporter nearly 40 years his junior. Our secretary of war is murdering unidentified civilians and trying to throw the admiral who is following orders under the boat. The director of the FBI is reportedly using a private jet for personal travel with his country music star girlfriend and delayed a murder investigation until somebody brought him an FBI jacket that fit his little body. “We’ve got the attorney general turning the justice department into the Keystone Cops,” he continued. “We have a wrestling magnate running the Department of Education who wants to get rid of the Department of Education. Our director of homeland security somehow has made killing a puppy the least controversial thing she’s done. She’s busy rounding up college girls and deporting them to God knows where. And our healthcare is in the vitamin supplement-powered hands of Dr Oz. “They have better-quality cabinets at Ikea,” he concluded. Stephen Colbert The year 2025 has “been a rough one”, said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. “I mean, obviously, there’s no one to blame for that, other than Donald Trump. “And a lot of people are,” he said, citing a new Gallup poll that found the president’s approval rating has dropped to 36%, with 60% disapproval. “Which is why Trump has started wearing a new hat: ‘More Popular Than Syphilis’,” Colbert joked. “So Trump is underwater in every category,” he continued, showing specific disapproval numbers on the economy, healthcare, the Epstein files, education and the environment. “Donald Trump is also the most hated Zootopia character, the lowest-rated midsize sedan and the least popular Oreo flavor, double-stuffed cankle,” Colbert quipped. But Trump’s worst bugbear as president remains the cost of living for average Americans. “He has been trying everything he can think of, which is not much,” said Colbert. On Tuesday, in one of his “weird cabinet meetings” that lasted three hours, Trump “addressed the affordability crisis head-on”. Specifically, Trump dismissed the concept of “affordability” as a “con job by the Democrats”. “It’s one of the many con job words made up by the Democrats, like democracy, dementia and da-Epstein files,” Colbert joked. Colbert also commented on Trump appearing to nap during his own cabinet meeting. “Let’s be fair – maybe he’s so old that he fell asleep in an afternoon meeting, or maybe he just closed his eyes to better concentrate on filling his adult diaper,” he speculated. “Then, he fell asleep.” The Daily Show And on The Daily Show, Desi Lydic checked in on the self-proclaimed “secretary of war”, Pete Hegseth, now in hot water for authorizing strikes on supposedly suspected drug-runner boats off the coast of Venezuela. Members of both parties and experts have said that the strikes constitute war crimes. “There’s one thing we know: if somebody did something wrong, he’s going to man up and take responsibility as the secretary of war,” Lydic deadpanned. Hegseth, naturally, placed the blame squarely on his commander, Adm Mitch Bradley. On X, Hegseth wrote: “I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made – on the September 2 mission and all others since.” “What a little bitch,” said Lydic. “Blaming someone by pretending to praise them? ‘I stand by him and all the decisions he made on his own, while I was out of the room. If you want to get to him, you’re going to have to get through me – and I will let you do that.’” “I also love how Pete’s pre-blaming Bradley for ‘all the others since’,” she added. “So yeah, things are starting to look a little dicey for the secretary of defensiveness, but Pete is fighting back the way a true warrior does: with memes.” Hegseth posted an image of Franklin the Turtle, a children’s character, shooting at a boat from a helicopter. “This whole image is deeply disturbing,” said Lydic. “Especially the part where the turtle is wearing a helmet – why is he wearing a helmet? His whole body is a helmet.”"
culture_2025_dec_03_norman-conquest-chew-valley-coin-exhibition-bath.txt,culture,2025-12-03,Steven Morris,Norman conquest coin hoard to go on show in Bath before permanent display,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/03/norman-conquest-chew-valley-coin-exhibition-bath,"The coins were buried in a valley in the English West Country almost 1,000 years ago at a time of huge political and social turmoil. A millennium on, plans have been announced to bring the Chew Valley Hoard, 2,584 silver coins hidden shortly after the Norman conquest, back to the south-west of England. The feelgood story of how the coins, worth more than £4m, were found by a band of metal detectorists will be told but visitors will also be encouraged to reflect on how the world continues to be gripped by worries about conflict, the actions of the powerful and money. Sam Astill, the chief executive of South West Heritage Trust, which acquired the hoard for the nation last year, said the idea was not just about showing off the coins and telling their history. He said: “There will also be a conversation about turning points, turning points in history or in people’s lives. The Chew Valley Hoard represents a turning point in our nation’s story. “But as well as evoking the turmoil after the [Norman] conquest, there’s a contemporary significance we’re seeking as well. I think we will ask our visitors to imagine what it must have felt like in 1066 and 1067 when the ruling class had been abolished and there was essentially no government. Obviously, they will draw on their own perspectives and ideas in responding.” The hoard was discovered by seven detectorists south of Bath in 2019. Last year the coins were acquired for the nation and went on display at the British Museum in London, where they were seen by thousands of visitors. The hoard is now in storage at the museum. On Wednesday South West Heritage Trust announced a £993,345 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to deliver a two-year engagement project to celebrate the hoard and mark the 1,000th anniversary of William the Conqueror’s birth, in 1028. The coins will be shown at the Roman Baths Museum, Bath, from January to March 2027. They will then be moved to a temporary exhibition space at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton while a permanent gallery for them is built there. There will be other activities, learning opportunities and events centred on the coins. It is believed the hoard was buried for safekeeping in 1067 or 1068, a time of rebellions in the south-west against William the Conqueror. Represented on just under half the coins is Harold II, the last crowned Anglo-Saxon king of England, who was killed at the Battle of Hastings. A little over half feature William the Conqueror. There is one coin that features Edward the Confessor. About 100 moneyers – the individuals in charge of producing coins – from 46 mints including Bath, Bristol, Exeter, Hastings, Ipswich, London and York are represented. The coins of Harold II are mainly from mints in south-east England, perhaps suggesting financial preparation for the Norman invasion. Astill said that while many people had a concept of 1066 and the Battle of Hastings, they know less about what happened afterwards. “There was a long transition to full-blown Norman rule and there were periods of turmoil and rebellion particularly here in the south-west.” Exeter, 70 miles south-west of where the hoard was buried, was a centre of resistance to the Normans and was besieged by William in 1068. “It may be that the coins were deposited for safe keeping during that period,” Astill said. Federica Smith-Roberts, a councillor at Somerset council and the executive member for communities, housing and culture, said: “The Chew Valley Hoard is a hugely significant treasure in every sense of the word and we cannot wait to welcome it back home to Somerset.”"
culture_2025_dec_04_late-night-roundup-hegseth-trump-naps.txt,culture,2025-12-04,Guardian staff,"Jimmy Kimmel on Pete Hegseth, ‘our secretary of war crimes’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/04/late-night-roundup-hegseth-trump-naps,"Late-night hosts tore into Pete Hegseth’s Venezuelan boat blame game, Donald Trump’s cabinet meeting naps and the annual Spotify Wrapped lists. Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel opened his Wednesday-evening monologue with an acknowledgement of a yearly tradition: the annual Spotify Wrapped list, documenting users’ listening habits for the year. “This Spotify, they really have it figured out,” he said. “They spy on you all year. It’s what they do. And then December comes around and they’re like, ‘We’ve been watching you.’ And we’re like, ‘Awesome! What did you find out?’” “I don’t know why other companies don’t do this,” he continued. “Like imagine getting this from Pornhub, you know? ‘You violated yourself for 6,322 minutes this year – up 5% from 2024! Your favorite genres are stepmothers and Dragonball Z.” Kimmel then turned his attention to the Maga-world freakout over criticism of Trump for falling asleep during a lengthy cabinet meeting on Monday. “The fact is, we all watched him dozing off repeatedly on television. Which meant that the Don Trump Admiration and Ball-Gobbling Society was forced to go into overdrive today to defend him,” Kimmel said before several clips of Maga supporters trying to brush off the story on cable news. “If you sleep three hours or four hours a night, you’re probably going to close your eyes, whether you’re 79 or 49,” said Laura Ingraham on Fox News. “I mean, who wouldn’t doze off in one of these things?” said a Newsmax host. And Dr Marc Siegel, a Fox News “senior medical analyst”, claimed that Thomas Edison believed in 10-minute naps – “What would they say? We wouldn’t have electricity, right?” “Right. It’s such a good point,” Kimmel deadpanned, mimicking Siegel – “Is that what you liberals want, no electricity? Because we will give that to you!” But “no one’s losing more sleep this week than our secretary of war crimes”, Pete Hegseth, under fire for authorizing a strike on a boat off the coast of Venezuela that was allegedly being used to smuggle drugs, and then a second strike to kill all survivors. The ranks of people calling for the prosecution of Hegseth for violating international law now includes Andrew Napolitano, a former co-worker of Hegseth’s on Fox News and a conservative commentator on the rightwing channel Newsmax. “Do you know how badly a member of Trump’s inner circle has to screw up to get criticized on Newsmax?” Kimmel mused. “I mean, if Pete Hegseth had run that guy’s foot over, he would’ve said, ‘It’s OK, I’ve got another one!’ Now he’s saying, ‘Lock him up, this is a war crime.’” Stephen Colbert And on The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also checked in on Hegseth, still under fire for “maybe definitely committing war crimes”. “They argue that those Venezuelan boats deserve to be blowed up real good because trust us, those are drug smugglers,” Colbert said. So he found it “a little odd” that on Friday, Trump announced that he would pardon former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted last year of conspiracy to import more than 400 tons of cocaine to the US. “For reference, here’s a picture of what a 400lb bag of cocaine would look like,” Colbert joked next to a photo of Donald Trump Jr. Asked about the double standard of pardoning a notorious drug trafficker while onboard Air Force One, Trump answered: “Well, I don’t know who you’re talking about. Which one?” “Which one?! How many notorious drug traffickers have you pardoned?” Colbert responded. In other White House news, the first lady released a new version of her seven-hour audiobook, in which she reads her memoir in Spanish. “It’s the perfect listen on a long road trip inside a windowless ICE van,” Colbert quipped. It’s an interesting accomplishment given that, although the first lady claims to speak five languages, she is not known to speak Spanish. “How did Melania do it?” Colbert wondered. “Well, it’s as lazy as you can imagine,” as the audiobook uses an AI-generated version of her voice, which one can listen to for $25. “Just like the work of that other great Spanish-language author, Gabriel García Mar2-D2,” Colbert quipped."
culture_2025_dec_05_barbican-revamp-to-give-london-arts-centre-a-new-lease-of-life.txt,culture,2025-12-05,Lanre Bakare Arts and culture correspondent,Barbican revamp to give ‘bewildering’ arts centre a new lease of life,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/05/barbican-revamp-to-give-london-arts-centre-a-new-lease-of-life,"“Everything leaks,” says Philippa Simpson, the director of buildings and renewal at the Barbican, who is standing outside the venue’s lakeside area and inspecting the tired-looking tiles beneath her feet. Water seeps through the cracks into the building below and serves as a reminder of the job facing Simpson and the team who are overhauling the 43-year-old landmark. The first phase of the project will cost £231m, and Simpson – who did a similar, if less daunting, job for the Young V&amp;A in east London – hopes it will be finished in time for the 50th anniversary in 2032. The overall bill is estimated to be £451m. A mammoth task awaits her. During a behind-the-scenes look the Guardian is shown the inner workings, including the central services plant room: a maze of concrete corridors lined by green pipework that is a third of the size of Wembley stadium. Inside, five tanks, including one that can hold 250,000 litres – that once provided hot water for heating – sit dormant and need to be replaced. The issue is that the Barbican was built around them, meaning they need to be chopped up and removed. The task is something that Richard McQuilliam, the head of engineering, calls “a messy, risky job”, which could work as a description of the whole project. The Barbican was divisive when it opened (described by the Guardian as “the world’s most bewildering arts centre”) but it is celebrated by many today as an iconic part of London’s skyline and creative life. Opened in 1982, the Barbican arts centre is a unique cultural institution. Built in the middle of the city of London on a former bomb site, the centre’s cultural offering was primarily dreamed up as entertainment for the 4,000 residents of the flats that tower above it. Today, more than 1.5 million people walk through its doors every year, making it one of the most popular cultural attractions in the UK. Part of the challenge is its age – or lack of. Compared with the Young V&amp;A, which has a building that dates back to the 1870s and has already been through several retrofits, it is a very young building. The Barbican has never been given a major facelift. “We have these extraordinary civic spaces in the heart of the Square Mile,” says Simpson. “But how do you make them usable for everybody? How do you make them fully permissive, fully open, fully inclusive?” Comprising a theatre, concert space, art gallery and conservatory, the Barbican has been celebrated as a well-executed vision of mid-century communal living. But it is severely lacking by modern design standards. The conservatory is inaccessible to wheelchair users and is only opened to the public for a few hours over the weekend; its lakeside area – replete with leaky tiles – looks worn out; and its foyers, which should be a welcoming area that give visitors pertinent information, are disorientating spaces. “People coming in and out of the main lakeside doors often miss the lifts,” says Jaymi Sudra, a partner at the Turner prize-winning architecture collective Assemble, who is part of the design team overhauling the wayfinding at the institution. “They completely walk past them.” New lightbulbs will brighten the foyer spaces, and the notoriously grotty carpets will be torn out and replaced. It is not only the tiles that are porous at the Barbican; Sudra says there are about 40 different entrances to the building. “Because there are so many points of entry it adds to this sense of people being slightly disoriented, not really having a clear idea of what level they’ve actually entered on to,” she says. The history of the arts centre explains some of the confusion. It had to be constructed around other elements, such as the lake and primarily the flats, meaning there is little consistency in the design and the entrances are not where you would expect to find them. The Silk Street entrance, which for many is the “front” of the building, is actually the back; while the huge doors that face the lakeside are technically the front entrance. Walkways loom over spaces. There are secret corridors for residents. Even for seasoned visitors, there is little rhyme or reason. The Barbican’s labyrinthine layout has caught out many visitors over the years. Stanley Tucci and David Dimbleby got lost, while the explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes once clambered over a wall to get in. Brian Eno was found wandering on the fourth floor trying to find the Fountain Room, which is on the ground floor. Fiona Shaw hated performing in the building and complained of actors being “lost on the staircases and the inhospitable corridors”. One of Sudra’s biggest jobs is creating a new signage scheme to replace the four in use now. They often clash and accessibility groups say they are hard for people to follow. Now all but the original (and listed) Ken Briggs signs are being removed. The organisation has historically made hay with the difficulty visitors have when trying to find it. Posters printed shortly after it opened feature the film critic Barry Norman holding a map next to a confused looking police officer with a caption: “If Barry Norman can find the new Barbican Centre before it opens in March he’ll review the season of classic English films”. At one point the shop sold a T-shirt that read: “I found the Barbican Centre.” Simpson hopes that when construction starts in 2027, a new – more accessible – era begins."
culture_2025_dec_05_pantone-cloud-dancer-2026-colour-year.txt,culture,2025-12-05,Emma Joyce explains it to Nick Miller,A minimalist statement or just Pantonedeaf? ‘Cloud dancer’ shade of white named Pantone’s 2026 colour of the year,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/05/pantone-cloud-dancer-2026-colour-year,"Hi, Emma! I’m so pumped to find out what colour 2026 is going to be. Fill me in! Brace yourself, Nick. Every year since 1999 Pantone chooses a colour for the year, a representation of the zeitgeist – from how we’re feeling to what we’re wearing, how we’re styling our homes and even our eyebrows. Last year’s was the darker shade of beige “mocha mousse”, the year before that was the soft, warm “peach fuzz”. This year’s pick is even more baffling. It’s “cloud dancer”, a “billowy, balanced white”, according to Pantone. Laurie Pressman, vice-president of Pantone Color Institute, said it is “a key structural color … allowing all colors to shine”. Hmmm, cloud dancer, sounds … wait, white? Are they trolling us? Is it even a proper colour? How do you describe the colour of clouds? Milk? A blank page? White is considered a colour by some but essentially all colour is a range of visible light. It’s one of the colours in my kid’s crayon box so I’m saying yes. Whether Pantone is trolling us is harder to ascertain. It says cloud dancer mixes well with others, isn’t overstimulating, makes a minimalist statement and exudes quiet sophistication. The reactions, though, are not as complimentary. Some say Pantone is completely “Pantonedeaf”. The fashion and trend forecaster Mandy Lee called it “disappointing”. Others have likened it to the coded promotion of eugenics in the Sydney Sweeney American Eagle ad. Yeah, right, hopefully they’re cheerfully oblivious about the fact this is not a great time to be pointedly celebrating whiteness … So how should I, a person rarely adjacent to a catwalk, make use of this information in my daily life? I just painted my kitchen ceiling white, does that count? It counts. As would your headphones, or your bathtub. It’s funny you mention catwalks, because many of this year’s have been bright, bold and fuzzy, including naturally dyed fake feathers on the runway at Stella McCartney’s Paris fashion week show. White featured, as it always does, in simple silk T-shirts at Chanel, collared dresses at Givenchy, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, wore a crisp all-white ensemble to Balenciaga’s Paris show. The US first lady, Melania Trump, is often seen wearing all white. The good news is: you probably already own something in the “discrete” (sic) and “understated” colour of the year. As Pressman said, Cloud Dancer “represents a more sustainable choice for the eco-conscious”, and to me that means not having to buy anything new at all. AT LAST, a fashion trend for the deeply unmotivated. A blank page, if you will. A cocoon of monochromatic zen amid the chaos. OK, I’m on board. Are you planning a whiteout for your wardrobe? Absolutely not. Have you tried removing tomato sauce stains from a white shirt? I don’t need more laundry disasters in 2026. I do own a pair of once-white Birkenstocks though, and those never go out of style."
culture_2025_dec_05_stephen-colbert-pete-hegseth-venezuela-trump-epstein.txt,culture,2025-12-05,Guardian staff,Stephen Colbert on Pete Hegseth’s Venezuela scandal: ‘Frantically pointing the finger’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/05/stephen-colbert-pete-hegseth-venezuela-trump-epstein,"Late-night hosts talked Donald Trump’s renaming of the Institute of Peace, Pete Hegseth’s ongoing Venezuela scandal and a new batch of photos from Epstein Island. Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert opened Thursday’s Late Show with a note about the president’s meeting with leaders from the auto industry, where announced that he would do away with the guidances enacted by Joe Biden to make more electric cars. “This is a Green New Stand,” said Trump in the Oval Office. “And people were paying too much for a car that didn’t work as well … All of the nonsense is going to be taken out of the cars.” “All you need in a car is the basics, folks,” said Colbert in his Trump voice. “You need the gas pedal, you need the steering wheel, and a little hula lady on the dashboard. Dance for me, tiny ukulele bride!” Trump also said he would cancel the Environmental Protection Agency’s “absurd” tailpipe emission standards. “Well, that makes sense,” said Colbert. “I mean, standing behind a tailpipe is how he applies his makeup.” In other Washington news this week, the Trump administration managed to get the name changed at the supposedly non-partisan Institute of Peace, which is now named … the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace. In a post to its official account on X, the state department said that the name was changed to “reflect the greatest dealmaker in our nation’s history”. “What are you talking about?! The ‘greatest dealmaker’?” Colbert scoffed. “Critics were surprised,” he noted, because the administration had previously called the institute “bloated and useless”. “So, Donald Trump,” Colbert laughed. Meanwhile, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, remains in hot water for bombing what the administration claimed, without evidence, are drug smugglers off the coast of Venezuela and, in September, executing survivors of an attack with a second strike. Even members of Hegseth’s own party have noted that this constitutes a violation of international law. Hegseth has been “frantically pointing the finger” at Frank “Mitch” Bradley, the navy admiral overseeing the operation. And on Thursday, “Mitch testified and frankly, things went bradly,” Colbert joked. Bradley told lawmakers that the two survivors of the initial strike in September were attempting to continue their drug run, as they were seen still onboard the damaged vessel alongside packages of illegal narcotics. “Yeah, but the boat was blown to bits!” Colbert responded. “How were they going to continue their drug run? Ride to Miami on the back of dolphin drug mules?” Jimmy Kimmel In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel revealed that, according to Google, he was the third-most trending person in the world for 2025, behind the singer d4vd (a suspect in a grisly murder) and rapper Kendrick Lamar (“who murdered Drake this year at the half-time of the Super Bowl”, Kimmel joked). “None of this would’ve ever happened without the support of loyal viewers like President Trump, who has done so much this year to raise awareness of our show,” the host said. “Thank you, Mr President, for making me No 3 in the world. “I beat Diddy! How did I beat Diddy this year?” he added. Kimmel then turned to more Trump news: “We’re all aware of how hungry for praise he is constantly, but I’m always surprised by how eager his suck-ups are to feed it to him.” That would be, in this case, the US Institute of Peace, now renamed the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace – “and casino”, Kimmel added. A White House spokesperson defended the renaming, claiming the agency “was once a bloated, useless entity that blew $50m per year while delivering no peace”. “So they named it after another bloated, useless entity that provides no peace,” said Kimmel. The Daily Show Only two weeks remain until the deadline for the Department of Justice to release all its files related to the late convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. “And Pam Bondi, if you’re listening, it’s still not too late to release them Advent-calendar-style,” said Jordan Klepper on the Daily Show. In the meantime, House Democrats continue to release some of the documents in their possession. “What’s in this latest drop?” Klepper wondered. “Is it emails? Maybe bank records?” Instead, it was more than 150 photos and videos of the vast Caribbean estate commonly known as “Epstein Island”, including images of the pool area, bedrooms and bathrooms, and a framed photo of Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell, meeting Pope John Paul II. “Wow, I can’t believe it. The face of the world’s most notorious pedophile ring got to meet Jeffrey Epstein?” Klepper joked. “That’s the most ‘game recognize game’ photo I’ve ever seen. “Now this release doesn’t contain any major bombshells,” Klepper noted, “but we did learn one new thing: Epstein Island looked like shit. “How does a billionaire’s private island look like a two-star AirBnb?” he continued. “I’m not even talking about the sex rooms – the common spaces are even worse,” such as the “library” with four patterned recliners clumped together facing together in the center of the room. “Jeffrey, come on! You have all the money in the world but you don’t have one pal who gets a Herman Miller catalogue?” said Klepper in mock disgust. “The pedophile billionaire couldn’t find one pedophile decorator to help out here? And don’t say it was Ghislaine’s job to decorate, because that’s sexist. She was a working professional who was very busy with her own sex-trafficking career.”"
culture_2025_dec_05_the-best-things-we-watched-read-and-listened-to-this-year-that-werent-from-2025.txt,culture,2025-12-05,Gwilym Mumford,"The Guide #220: The best things we watched, read and listened to this year – that weren’t from 2025",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/05/the-best-things-we-watched-read-and-listened-to-this-year-that-werent-from-2025,"We’ve just inched into December, which of course means Christmas list season. Already, five days in, plenty of publications have shared their cultural best-ofs for 2025 – you can read the Guardian’s best books and songs of the year right now, with our countdowns in TV, film and music coming very soon. Meanwhile, many of you will have been bombarded on social media by screengrabs of your colleagues/friends/enemies’ Spotify Wrapped playlists (though Mood Machine author Liz Pelly has written pretty convincingly about why you shouldn’t share yours). This year’s Wrapped includes a “listening age” feature, which uses the release dates of the music you streamed to determine how horribly out-of-date your tastes are – revealing to some users that they are, in fact, centenarians. But there is, of course, no shame in taking a break from the deluge of new releases to catch some forgotten or not-forgotten classics. So in this week’s Guide we’re sharing some of the best non-2025 culture we watched, listened to, read or played in 2025 … *** Film Fuelled by the appreciation for old films on Letterboxd and podcasts like Blank Check and The Big Picture, revival houses or repertory cinemas are having a moment on both sides of the Atlantic. I had a great time watching Jean-Pierre Melville’s noir classic Le Samouraï (available to stream on Prime Video, amazingly), with Alain Delon slinking about Paris in a trenchcoat on the big screen. And was pretty blown away seeing Billy Wilder’s The Lost Weekend (available to rent on most streaming services) for the first time, a movie that may have received a bit of a viewing bump through the Oscars success of Anora, which joined The Lost Weekend in being one of four Palme d’Or winners to go on to win best picture (The other two? Parasite, of course, and 1955’s Marty, which is still on my to-view list.) In a big year for Richard Linklater (he has two films, Blue Moon and Nouvelle Vague, now out in the US), I revisited his breakthrough, Slacker (sadly not on streaming, but the DVD is pretty widely available). A trippy amble round early 90s Austin, Texas, in which you encounter a series of often defiantly odd (and defiantly unemployed) characters, it’s a film I absolutely loved in my own Slackerish early 20s, but worried I might have grown out of today. Not a bit of it: it’s still completely mesmerising, a world that you want to climb through the screen and live in. GM *** Television With Adolescence dominating this year’s TV landscape, I stumbled on an old British drama with a lot of parallels: Jake’s Progress (Channel 4), Alan Bleasdale’s 1995 drama about a dysfunctional middle-class Liverpool family struggling to deal with a pyromaniac child. It is quite of its time – both the acting and the score are grand – but it is compelling and, like all of Bleasdale’s stuff, it avoids the easy and cliched for something perceptive and lived-in. Meanwhile, while we already did a pretty exhaustive deep dive into the old documentaries available on streaming earlier this year in the Guide, there’s one more non-2025 documentary on iPlayer that I want to flag, though it is a bit of a cheat really: S4C doc Ffa Coffi Pawb! was released just eight days before 2025 began. It’s worth a look though, offering up an exhaustive, entertaining account of the DIY, defiantly anti-commercial Welsh language music scene that bubbled up in the 1980s, and launched the career of a young Gruff Rhys (later of Super Furry Animals fame). The archive footage is brilliant: clips of sweaty gigs in the back rooms of north Walian pubs, and a clip of a pre-puberty Rhys telling a Welsh chatshow host about the punk fanzine he just made. Fantastic. GM *** Music Reading an article by an indie record label boss on the desperate state of the industry is an unlikely way of discovering some music, but Jagjaguwar founder Darius Van Arman’s piece for Stereogum did introduce me to a great record his label put out in their early days: Drunk’s A Derby Spiritual (1996), a backwoods indie-folk album sat somewhere between Bonnie Prince Billy and Neutral Milk Hotel, which Van Arman says has received a grand total of $100 in streams in the 15 years it has been on Spotify. Bleak! Give it a listen. Elsewhere, the new album by Zamrock veterans Witch got me digging into their 70s heyday. Their self-titled album, the last one before they splintered and became a disco group, is full of great, summery, psych-tinged tunes. Finally, the best “needle drop” in a film this year came in One Battle After Another, as Steely Dan’s Dirty Work soundtracked an extremely stoned Leo attending a parent-teacher meeting. Between all these, my “listening age” must be hovering around the late 60s. GM *** Books I finally got round to reading Self-Help by American writer Lorrie Moore earlier this year, the 1985 short story collection that earned her cult status. Sardonic, cutting and aggressively clever, Moore’s collection pokes fun at the self-help genre through stories written in the second person imperative, with titles like How to Be an Other Woman, How to Talk to Your Mother (Notes), and The Kid’s Guide to Divorce. Witty wordplay and experimental chronology mark out these stories exploring womanhood, relationships, illness, family and loss. And Moore manages to be both snarky and profound. Ella Creamer.

It has an eclectic selection of classics from the N64, SNES, Game Boy and more – some of which I’ve never played before, such as 2005’s Chibi-Robo!, a game about being an obliging miniature robot helping out a weird little girl in a frog hat. I also finished the superbly creepy Super Metroid for the first time, a sci-fi all-timer. Keza MacDonald. Keza writes the Guardian’s Pushing Buttons newsletter on gaming.

Should Olsen’s character pick the man she settled down with (Teller) or her first love (Turner)? It Was Just an Accident Out now This Palme d’Or-winning feature from Iranian director Jafar Panahi blends social realism with political commentary, as a man (Ebrahim Azizi) and his pregnant wife (Afsaneh Najmabadi), travelling with their young daughter (Delmaz Najafi), are involved in a minor car crash. Folktales Out now Documentary-makers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady (Jesus Camp) follow a group of teens as they take a gap year at a traditional folk high school in Arctic Norway, where the emphasis is less on a traditional curriculum and more on dog sledding and survival skills. Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 Out now Based on the second video game in the popular series, this sequel sees Josh Hutcherson reprising his role as night guard Mike Schmidt, and Jim Henson’s Creature Shop back on puppet duty, for this horror about animatronic critters possessed from within by unquiet souls. Catherine Bray * * * Going out: Gigs The Charlatans O2 Academy Leeds, 6 December; touring to 12 December Released in October, the Charlatans’ 14th album We Are Love found the indie perennials continuing to push their sound via production help from Dev Hynes. Songs such as its psych-tinged title track should sit neatly alongside their best work when played live. Michael Cragg Georgia Mancio Trio The Verdict, Brighton, 6 December; Peterborough Jazz Club, 14 December This quietly evocative singer has long been a lot more than a standards specialist: she can reinvent Antônio Carlos Jobim classics; skip through fast bebop swingers; and captivate audiences with the storytelling of her originals. She’s accompanied by fine keyboardist Pete Whittaker and drummer Dave Ohm here. John Fordham Barbara Hannigan and Bertrand Chamayou Wigmore Hall, London, 6 December The fearless Canadian soprano joins forces with the ever-adventurous French pianist for 20th- and 21st-century works. Hannigan sings Messiaen’s song cycle Chants de Terre et de Ciel and Chamayou plays Scriabin, including the late, obsessive Vers la Flamme, before they tackle John Zorn’s Jumalatteret, celebrating the goddesses of Sami Shamanism and described by Hannigan as the hardest thing she’s ever sung. Andrew Clements Jamiroquai Co-op Live, Manchester, 6 December; touring to 14 December Jay Kay and his jazz-funk band arrive in arenas this week. With work under way on a new album there’s a lot for the diehards, while Virtual Insanity and Canned Heat should soothe the glory hunters. MC * * * Going out: Art Wes Anderson Design Museum, London, to 26 July The scene in Wes Anderson’s Grand Budapest Hotel when a villain punches a hole in an Egon Schiele painting is one of the funniest art moments in cinema. This and other Anderson films are layered confections of design and aestheticism. Here he gets a retrospective of his exquisite comic sensibility. Performing Trees Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, to 4 April Do trees actually perform? They do in art, according to this exhibition, and have been doing so for centuries, from orange trees in Renaissance paintings to Romantic firs and impressionist poplars. Trees by Cézanne, Carracci, Sutherland and George Shaw feature in this forest of delights from the Whitworth collection. William Nicholson Pallant House Gallery, Chichester, to 10 May This respected British painter’s life straddled the Victorian and modern ages: he was born in 1872 and lived until 1949. But his most memorable art takes you to the blithely unseeing years of the early 1900s with tender, tranquil, colourful scenes of a world about to be lost to war. Monument to the Unimportant Pace Gallery, London, to 14 February Modern art’s shift from grand narratives to everyday objects – Coke cans, flowers in a vase – finds expression here. Artists featured include Claes Oldenburg, Rachel Whiteread and Sylvie Fleury, in a survey from pop to now. Jonathan Jones * * * Going out: Stage Rob Brydon Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, 7 December; touring to 16 December We may not be getting Gavin and Stacey this Christmas, but Uncle Bryn is still spreading the seasonal spirit. Alongside his “fabulous band”, Brydon will combine songs, jokes and his incredible impersonations (sadly Steve Coogan won’t be on hand to critique them). Rachel Aroesti Into the Woods Bridge theatre, London, to 18 April Director Jordan Fein has a knack for reigniting musicals (see also Fiddler on the Roof). Here he tackles Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s entrancing work, which puts a twist on four Grimm tales. With design from the brilliant Tom Scutt. Miriam Gillinson Beauty and the Beast Northern Stage, Newcastle upon Tyne, to 3 January An all-female creative team helm this year’s panto, directed by Bryony Shanahan and devised by Katie Mitchell and Lucy Kirkwood. Unexpected twists include mischievous fairies, a Thoughtsnatcher machine and a live Insect Orchestra of fleas and flies. MG Wee Nutcracker Tramway, Glasgow, 12 December to Christmas Eve A trip to see the Nutcracker may be Christmas tradition, but the full ballet can be a lot to sit through for small children waiting for their interval ice cream. Step forward Scottish Ballet’s Wee Nutcracker, adapted for kids age 5+, it’s a smaller-scale version of the story, capped at 45 minutes. Lyndsey Winship * * * Staying in: Streaming The Revenge Club Paramount+, 12 December Based on JD Pennington’s novel The Othello Club, this drama about a group of divorced strangers who decide to get their own back on their former spouses is the kind of high-concept crime caper that post-peak TV does so well. Martin Compston, Meera Syal, Sharon Rooney and Aimee-Ffion Edwards star. The War Between the Land and the Sea BBC One &amp; iPlayer, 7 December, 8.30pm One last hurrah for the big Disney+ Doctor Who deal, as this ambitious spin-off chronicling humanity’s battle against ancient species the Sea Devils commences. Russell Tovey is the man with the world on his shoulders; Gugu Mbatha-Raw plays one of the beleaguered creatures. Man vs Baby Netflix, 11 December Rowan Atkinson consolidates his Netflix-abetted comeback with this follow-up to his 2022 hit Man vs Bee. Once again, Trevor Bingley is faced with an unexpected colleague on a housesitting job: cue Bean-esque slapstick and humiliation. Susannah Fielding and Ashley Jensen co-star. Nick Cave’s Veiled World Sky Arts &amp; Now, 6 December, 9pm Timed to coincide with the Matt Smith-led adaptation of his novel The Death of Bunny Munro, this one-off documentary examines Cave’s unique artistic universe with help from friends and collaborators including Warren Ellis, Bella Freud, Florence Welch and Colin Greenwood. RA * * * Going Out: Games Skate Story PS5, Switch 2, PC; out 8 December As if skateboarding wasn’t perilous enough, Skate Story sees you play a brittle rider made of glass making their way through the underworld. The surreal scenario doesn’t skimp on depth: there are more than 70 tricks to master. Terminator 2D: No Fate PS4, PS5, Xbox, Switch, PC; out 12 December What if 1991’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day had a new video game adaptation appropriate to the decade it came from? Expect side-scrolling arcade action and lavish pixel art, plus new missions alongside reimaginings of the film’s set-pieces. Matthew Reynolds * * * Staying in: Albums XO – Fashionably Late Out now New UK girlband XO arrive with their debut “body of work” in the shape of this high-octane EP. The Charli xcx-assisted Real Friends is an attitude-heavy update of Girl Power, while Silly Boy – complete with earworm whistle riff – and Candy are naggingly catchy. A promising start. Alison Wonderland – Ghost World Out now Since swapping classical – she was a cellist with the Sydney Youth Opera – for dance music, Alexandra Sholler has scored three Top 10 albums in her homeland. Ghost World continues her penchant for mind-melting EDM, specifically on the metallic clank of XTC and Get Started’s sweaty dancefloor yearning. TEED – Always With Me Out now London-born electronic music producer Orlando Higginbottom, FKA Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs, releases this debut album under a new moniker. Written in LA, chiefly on a single synth, Always With Me harnesses a nostalgic musical and emotional brevity on songs like Desire and My Melody. Melody’s Echo Chamber – Unclouded Out now Thirteen years after her debut, French musician Melody Prochet returns with this fourth album of sweeping psych-pop abstraction. With a title inspired by Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki and a hard-won love for life, songs such as In the Stars feel both dramatic and buoyant. MC * * * Staying in: Brain food Masaka Kids, A Rhythm Within Netflix, 9 December This joyful film follows a group of children in a Ugandan orphanage whose dances have gained millions of views over the past five years on social media. We see how virality has transformed their lives. The Modern Art Notes Podcast Art critic Tyler Green hosts this in-depth series featuring hour-long conversations with artists, historians and curators. Highlights include Antony Gormley on the changing status of sculpture, and Hew Locke on British imperialism. Crash Out The aptly named American Artist presents this video commission for Somerset House’s online exhibition space, Channel, exploring the tension between free speech and censorship – all via the medium of a fictional streaming persona.

culture_2025_dec_06_nicola-coughlan-interview-bridgerton-derry-girls-activism-politics-parasocial-fandom.txt,culture,2025-12-06,Charlotte Edwardes,"‘True activism has to cost you something’: Bridgerton’s Nicola Coughlan on politics, paparazzi and parasocial fandom",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/06/nicola-coughlan-interview-bridgerton-derry-girls-activism-politics-parasocial-fandom,"Back in 2008, when Nicola Coughlan was at drama school, a guy in her class swaggered over and, with all the brimming confidence of young men in the noughties, asked her, “Do the Irish think the English are really cool?” Coughlan, born in Galway, mimes processing the question. “Well,” she said, “it’s quite complicated. Like, there’s a lot of history there, between the two countries. Like, there’s a lot going on.” Today, people are more knowledgable about the history of the English in Ireland. Coughlan is happy about that. She’s also happy about the explosion of Irish storytelling in popular culture – Normal People, Trespasses, Small Things Like These, not to mention the series that made her name, Derry Girls. And she’s proud of young Irish actors – Paul Mescal, Barry Keoghan and Lola Petticrew, to name a few. She listens to bands such as Fontaines DC, CMAT and Kneecap. “It’s such a small country and the amount of creativity that comes out of Ireland is really extraordinary.” But now there’s a different kind of English guy, the one who swaggers over “to explain Irish history to you through the music. I’m like, ‘No, no. I know all of that.’ Like, ‘I know why [Kneecap] is wearing a balaclava, yes. I know why all of it.’” And then there’s the person who congratulates her for having an elected leftwing female president in the form of Catherine Connolly. “I’m like, ‘Our third. Our third female president. And by the way, Michael D Higgins, her predecessor, is incredibly leftwing. And a poet.’” Depending on your viewing tastes, Coughlan is either most recognisable as Clare Devlin from Derry Girls, the sublime comedy about Catholic teens set in the Troubles in 1990s Northern Ireland, or Penelope Featherington from Bridgerton, the Jane Austen-meets-Gossip Girl Netflix juggernaut in which she plays a Regency debutante with a secret. She’s become equally well known for her frankness – refusing, even under considerable pressure, to stop talking about Gaza or abortion or trans rights. She’s also not going to apologise for not meeting societal expectations of what a starlet should look like. This steel is arresting in person from such a fairy-cake package. She looks like a Norman Rockwell illustration of a child from the 40s or 50s, or an Eileen Soper book cover, blond with the rounded forehead of a china doll, fondant pink cheeks that blotch at times with emotion. And she’s tiny, 5ft at a push, swamped in an oversized beige jersey. (She tells me that back when she’d collect her niece and nephew from primary school, other kids would shout, “Why are you so short if you’re an adult? Why do you look like that?”) This morning, we’re deep in the concrete block that is London’s National Theatre, discussing her latest project, The Playboy of the Western World. It’s a play set in a pub in 1900s County Mayo and she’s immersed in conversations with the other actors about “the contradictions of being Irish and the perceptions of Irish people and what it means to be Irish”, she says. “Also to be part of a country that was colonised for so long, and had ideas imposed on it, but we’re all sitting around speaking English in the British National Theatre.” She’s interested to see how audiences respond, and a little apprehensive. “I read some reviews from when it was staged at the Old Vic in 2011 and they were like, ‘No one could understand a word!’ You don’t see anyone going to [Shakespeare’s] Globe and writing, ‘I couldn’t understand anything.’” On stage she’ll be reunited with Siobhán McSweeney – Sister Michael in Derry Girls – and directed by Caitríona McLaughlin of Dublin’s Abbey theatre. The all-Irish cast accounts for the outbreaks of Gaeilge in the corridors, which Coughlan loves. “I saw a report about how many young people are learning Irish now. It’s terrible to admit, but as a teenager, myself and my friends were like, ‘Well, I can’t use this language anywhere else, so why would I learn it?’ Then as you get older, you realise it’s your native language, and you feel ashamed that you can’t speak it.” She’s relieved to be doing something small and intimate after Bridgerton (the show is the reason a group of diehard fans are outside the stage door every day) – her first play since 2018. Bridgerton was already one of Netflix’s hugest shows, but an astounding 45.05 million viewers watched the first episodes of season three, the season in which Coughlan’s character transforms from bashful and bookish into a ravishing goddess, which climaxed with her near six-minute nude sex scene (a record even for this bonkbuster). How she dealt with journalists’ questions about doing a nude scene – given her voluptuousness – was instructive. She’s done press tours with hundreds of interviews and, sure enough, each time, there it was nestled in among the anodyne and the technical. She tried batting it away, rejecting the label “plus size”, politely asking people to stop contacting her directly to offer their opinion on her curves. One night, doing a Q&amp;A on stage in Dublin, she was asked about her “bravery”. “You know it is hard,” she said, hand resting gently on her corseted waist. “Because I think women with my body type – women with perfect breasts – we do not see ourselves on screen enough.” She paused to soak up the laughter from the audience. “I am very proud to be a member of the perfect breasts community. I hope you enjoy seeing them.” The riposte captured both her come-off-it realness and the ludicrousness of what, until recently, has been considered acceptable to ask women in a PR back and forth. No wonder the clip went viral. “It was a joke I’d definitely made to friends,” she says now. “But I’d never said it in public. You know what [journalists] want to get out of you and you think, I’m not going to give you that. I’m just going be stupid in response.” Although Bridgerton was huge amounts of fun and she’s proud of her work and adores all the cast and crew, it brought a landslide of attention, some of which, well, let’s just say there’s a specific type of parasocial fandom. “With Derry Girls, people really enjoy the show, and say, ‘I love that.’ With Bridgerton, it’s a different beast.” Fans identified strongly with her character. They devoured theories about Coughlan and her co-star love interest Luke Newton, convinced they were a real-life couple concealing their marriage. They looked for clues in what she wore, what she posted, where she appeared, believing that, like Taylor Swift, Coughlan was telegraphing messages specifically to them – “which I’m definitely not. I definitely just put a jumper on and the colour doesn’t mean anything.” When Newton posted photographs of a summer holiday with his actual girlfriend, those fans felt cheated, called it a PR stunt, a hoax. They wrote wild posts and cancelled their Netflix subscriptions. “The maddest thing they thought was that I’d had a secret baby and was hiding it,” Coughlan says. “I would like to go on the record and say, ‘I don’t have a secret baby.’” Then she sugars her tone, “But it’s real in the show! They’re married for ever in the show! They have a baby in the show!” There was also acute public scrutiny of Coughlan’s love life, partly because her boyfriend, the actor Jake Dunn, is 25 and she is 38. It was bad enough after paparazzi shots appeared of her with Dunn in the early days of their relationship (“Imagine if you had an evening at the pub and then you walked around, talking, having a lovely time. And a few days later, you see pictures of that. The violation is immense”). But a widespread assumption that she had courted this publicity meant she was suddenly fair game for anyone with a cameraphone. She was photographed as she went about her day – shops, parks, restaurants, streets – the pictures uploaded online. “People go, ‘Oh, there’s so-and-so from TV.’ They forget you’re a person.” Soon her world began to contract. Fans were trying to find out where she lived. They posted photos of her and Dunn in real time and she realised that they were being tailed. “That level of attention is hugely intense. And I don’t know how well that suits me. The intensity gave me horrific anxiety,” she says. “I was like, ‘I really want to go away.’ And also, because I’m somewhat politically outspoken, I didn’t know that people didn’t mean me harm. Work is one world and my private life is another. When one started collapsing into the other, I thought, oh my God, what have I done?” Her face goes pink and she apologises because she’s trying not to cry but the tears are spilling over. And then she’s apologising both because it genuinely stresses her out to think what might have happened if people had found out where she lived, but also because, look at her, she’s being ridiculous, crying in the first interview she’s done in a year. Then she’s laughing and crying at the same time and telling me not to worry because I’m scrabbling around in my Pret bag looking for a napkin. She cries all the time, she says, rallying. She cried last night, in fact, watching Married at First Sight because there was a couple so in love, but he lived in Brighton and she in Liverpool. She cried watching Oasis recently because they played Wonderwall and she hadn’t realised until she heard it live that “it’s a fucking masterpiece”. She touches the corner of her eye and picks up her point. A year later, she’s still reflecting on the intensity of the Bridgerton experience. It’s made her think twice about her career trajectory. Only the other day, watching Wicked, she thought of Jonathan Bailey: “You are a movie star, like, you are literally huge, but I don’t know that I could do that.” And in the summer when she didn’t get a part she’d auditioned for in a big movie (they cast a man instead), she felt OK. “It sounds really saccharine, but I do really just want to work with nice people who want to make great things. Those are my guiding principles now. Because I am really sensitive and I can’t work in bad environments. I’m not built for it at all.” When Derry Girls first came out, Couglan’s plan was “to be myself in the public eye”, and if anyone misunderstood, “I’d explain what I meant and it would all be fine.” She learned quickly enough that the actual way to deal with trolls was “to block and move on”. These days she’s retreated from social media and is mainly on the New York Times games app, trying to do the crossword in under 10 minutes. She uses her Instagram platform mostly to raise awareness and money for charity. Back in April she helped Not A Phase, the charity supporting trans people, to stay open. “I don’t have a Twitter account on which to say ‘I don’t think blah blah blah’, so I was like, well, maybe I should help raise money. And I did.” So far, she’s also raised more than £1.5m for relief for people in Palestine through organisations such as the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, ActionAid UK and Medical Aid for Palestine. She knew early on in the conflict that she had to do something, “Not in a holier than thou way. I was just, like, no, I don’t think I can stay quiet about [watching civilians being killed]. But no one was talking about it early on. People were very afraid to.” Some of those she worked with – “people with my best interests at heart” – told her, “You could really damage your career doing this.” Who, I ask? “I feel bad saying who specifically. But that’s the truth, I could. And I had to go, OK, I have to accept that. They said, ‘You mightn’t be able to do this, this and this [job].’ And I thought, well, then I don’t want to be able to do that, that and that. I can’t throw away my moral conscience. True activism, it should cost you something.” She started wearing a ceasefire pin to public appearances. “People [on social media] really tried to be bullies about it and go, ‘Shut up and stop talking.’ And I was, like, well, no.” She estimates that she lost a quarter of a million followers on Instagram, which in crude terms is money, because commercial deals are often calculated on engagement numbers. “So it costs me something. But that’s a price I’m very happy to pay.” Did she lose friends? “I had difficult moments with friends, yes. With Jewish friends. It’s untrue to conflate [support of Palestine] with antisemitism. All of these systems of oppression and hatred go hand in hand – antisemitism, Islamophobia – they’re abhorrent and I reject them all. But it’s a way of silencing people, to throw antisemitism as an accusation.” She told those friends, “‘There’s no world in which I would not stand up as vocally for antisemitism.’ And those are the more difficult conversations to have – the actual, real ones with people in your life. But you have to approach those with understanding, too. It must feel really intense. It must feel horrific.” She says she went on one of the London marches – she can’t remember when exactly – but it was positioned as a “pro-Hamas” march by the government and some media, and resulted in “a very difficult conversation” with one particular friend. “I was, like, ‘I was there, literally. And it wasn’t [pro-Hamas].’ I can’t speak for every single person at a march, obviously, but there was no space for that in the atmosphere I saw.” She defends her decision to get out there. “It’s very easy to type something on social media and put your phone away. It’s harder to show up. All that is very important.” * * * Coughlan was born just outside the city of Galway, the young child. Her father, Martin, was in the Irish Army and worked for much of his career for the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation on peacekeeping missions. Among the places he and her mother lived in the 70s and 80s were Jerusalem, Lebanon and Syria. Coughlan says her parents did not “impose dogma on us”. But they did often talk about that time happily, about how much they loved their work. What Coughlan took from those conversations was “both my parents trying to help in practical ways”. Although her father died five days before she was offered the part in Derry Girls, “I hope that he knew I was on the right path.” He came over to see her do a reading of Jess and Joe Forever at the Old Vic. “He was almost like a theatre luvvie for that one night. He was in the bar at the Old Vic, and he was full of it. He was really excited.” She jokes that as a child she parked herself in front of the TV, “never going outdoors” (one reason, she adds, for her glass-like complexion – no sun damage). It was while sitting on the floor watching Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz that she first realised she wanted to act. From the age of nine she had a professional career “doing little bits”. And even back then acting felt completely right. “It was like that true love feeling. When you’re like, ‘Everything makes sense.’” What was harder was convincing her parents that this could be a career. Her father had grown up on a farm and joined the army at 17. “So having a child that’s like, ‘I’m going to be a thespian full-time! That’s how I’ll pay my bills!’ he was like, ‘Jesus, oh my God, what?’” The way she tells it, she was a handful at school. She remembers getting into a fight with the parish priest. She hated mass. “A cruel and unusual punishment for an ADHD child. You’re sat there listing to, ‘Remember you are dust and to dust you shall return’ and, like, having a fucking existential crisis every time. When I realised I never had to go back to mass, I was like, ‘Brilliant!’ The most uncomfortable seats you’ve ever sat on.” Incidentally, she was telling someone the other day why she hates Irish country and western music. “Which I’m sorry to anyone who’s a fan, but I literally have, like, a Pavlovian horror response to it, because it’s what my dad used to play in the car on the way to mass on Sunday. So I hear it. I’m like” – she makes a noise like huuuurrr from the pit of her stomach – “It’s straight back to getting out of bed early on a Sunday, getting into the car, listening to country and western music and then having an existential crisis.” She followed her siblings to the University of Galway, studying English and classics because she liked the “salacious” aspect, “all the bacchanalia” in Roman and Greek history. “Less so the dates of wars.” Afterwards, she went to the Oxford School of Drama for a foundation course, then on to Royal Birmingham Conservatoire’s School of Acting for a master’s. She wrote her thesis on improv in the work of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. There followed a painful and very lean near decade while she waited for her acting career to take off. She did a series of jobs – as a waitress at Bill’s in Ealing (“Didn’t love that”) and at Snog in Westfield, Shepherd’s Bush (“My worst job. People go to Westfield just to be terrible to other people”). One of her favourite jobs was at Lush. “I used to do all the bath bombs and stuff for little kids. I love kids.” But even that had its low points. “One day a little girl said, ‘When I’m older, I want to work here.’ Without a beat, her mum said, ‘No, no, darling, when you’re older, you’ll have a better job than this.’ I wanted to say, ‘I have two degrees. I have no shame in what job I’m doing. Why do you think I’m less than you because I can only get this job?’” Twice she had to return home when she ran out of money. Once she was fired from a promo job with Coors Light because, she says, one of the reps freaked out at how young she looked. She still gets ID’d – although it’s been a few months now, so she wonders aloud if she’s crossed the threshold for what it looks like to be 18. Earlier this year she was at a film festival discussing how she was first cast as 15-year-old Clare in Derry Girls when she was 30, and Barry Keoghan piped up from the audience, “What? How old is she now? Why does she look like that?” Coughlan has an immediacy of emotion that is both startling and entertaining. She says her brain goes off “in 50 different directions” and she can bring seemingly quite disparate subjects together without any fear of contradiction. She remembers now how she had no patience once she’d grasped a concept at school. But as she got older, her high-speed approach became more difficult. For instance, she could only ever revise last minute. To learn her lines for her drama exams she locked herself in her wardrobe. “Literally. I remember sitting in the wardrobe going, ‘Why can’t you just do this normally?” (She still learns lines in the makeup chair shortly before going on set.) But then there was the hyperfocus and the slight bewilderment that not everyone was as interested in certain topics as her. Left to her own devices she’ll spending hours browsing gadgets on the internet – “I have two air purifiers, two robot vacuums, two air quality monitors” – or watching really dressed-up girls making sandwiches on TikTok while at the same time forgetting to eat. “That was a big thing living alone, that I would get no sense of how time would be passing.” She talks animatedly about her two forthcoming projects – the latest of Dominic Savage’s I Am series and The Magic Faraway Tree alongside Claire Foy and Andrew Garfield – and I ask, was it better, in the end, to have found fame older? “For me, yes. I had to live in the real world and learn how to pay my council tax, etc. It made me aware and appreciative of what I have. I also know what’s real and what’s important.” This will be the first Christmas in her life that Coughlan hasn’t gone home to Galway – “because of the play,” she explains. But her ties to the city are strong. Her two best friends from school still live there and her family, of course. Her mum worries – “Oh my God, she’s an Irish mother, she’s programmed to worry!” – but calls all the time. “She’ll be like, ‘Tell them to give you a day off. You tell them.’ And I’m like, ‘It doesn’t work like that, unfortunately.’” • The Playboy of the Western World is at the National Theatre in London until 28 February 2026 and will be broadcast in cinemas via NT Live from 28 May 2026."

What our reviewer said “No one’s going to come away from Everybody Scream complaining about a paucity of big choruses and impassioned operatic vocal extemporisations.

culture_2025_nov_01_josh-oconnor-the-shape-shifting-star-who-became-cinemas-most-wanted.txt,culture,2025-11-01,Nadia Khomami Arts and culture correspondent,Josh O’Connor: the shape-shifting star who became cinema’s most wanted,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/01/josh-oconnor-the-shape-shifting-star-who-became-cinemas-most-wanted,"He came to prominence with his portrayal of Prince Charles in The Crown, and now it seems that Josh O’Connor might be primed for his own coronation. The British actor is in three major films between now and January – better known to film-lovers as awards season. He leads Kelly Reichardt’s art heist drama Mastermind, which opened in UK cinemas last week; stars opposite Paul Mescal in the period romance drama The History of Sound; and takes the central role in Wake Up Dead Man, Rian Johnson’s third instalment in the Knives Out mystery franchise. There’s also the persistent industry chatter that he’s among those being considered for the next James Bond. “This Is The Autumn Of Josh O’Connor,” declared Vogue recently, while GQ wondered, “How Josh O’Connor Became the Thinking Man’s Leading Man”. But O’Connor’s success hasn’t come out of nowhere. Born in Cheltenham in 1990 and trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, he graduated in 2011 and spent the following decade steadily building a career across stage, television and independent film, becoming one of the most sought-after actors of his generation. He appeared in productions at the National Theatre and the Donmar Warehouse, and took early screen roles in TV dramas including Law &amp; Order: UK, Peaky Blinders and Ripper Street. On film, he was in features including The Riot Club and Hide and Seek – a story of four young Londoners who move to an isolated country cottage. “What set Josh apart was he seemed so clever and so committed to what an artist’s life is, with real integrity,” Hide and Seek director Joanna Coates told the Guardian. “He really cares about making meaningful things, which sounds simple but holding true to that takes grit.” Coates said O’Connor was not only dedicated but also “really funny”. “I have a whole blur of special memories from that time – but there was a particular scene where he and another actor (Daniel Metz) were making each other laugh so much, in a moment that veered into pure improvisation. It felt so pure and funny we kept it in. The laughter is real.” O’Connor’s breakout role came in 2017 with God’s Own Country, Francis Lee’s tender romance set in the Yorkshire Dales. Playing Johnny Saxby, a young farmer whose life changes after the arrival of a Romanian migrant worker, O’Connor’s vulnerable performance and experiments with method acting drew comparisons to early Heath Ledger and won him the British Independent Film Award for best actor. Lee has described O’Connor as “a real shape-shifter” and said his performance in the film “confirmed his place on casting agents’ scouting radar as one of those subtle, humble chameleons who can disappear into parts and are dubbed ‘actors’ actors’”. Alec Secăreanu, who starred opposite O’Connor in God’s Own Country, told the Guardian the film was “a milestone” in both of their careers and described O’Connor as “the best actor I’ve ever worked with”. “He was so dedicated to the character and to the story,” Secăreanu said. “Anyone who would have him part of their project could call themselves blessed, he is a force that can bring so much truth and power to any character he’s working on. He makes it appear as if it’s easy, only because his approach is thorough and deliberate.” Laia Costa, who starred opposite O’Connor in the romantic drama Only You the following year, said O’Connor was “a brilliant collaborator”. “We were meant to arrive in Glasgow a full week before filming began, but I was stuck in Miami, grounded by hurricane season,” she recalled. “It was chaos – no rehearsal time, no chance to properly build the chemistry our characters needed”. But O’Connor, she added, “was incredible. Completely effortless, calm, and present. There’s something innate about his talent; it’s not something you can teach or fake.” It was in 2019 that O’Connor gained widespread recognition, when he joined the cast of The Crown as Prince Charles, portraying the future king during his young adulthood and early marriage. His depiction of the prince across the series’ third and fourth seasons was lauded for its precision and depth, and earned him an Emmy award and a Golden Globe. The Crown’s creator, Peter Morgan, has compared O’Connor’s talents to that of the former Barcelona footballer Andres Iniesta. “I was drawn to his sensitivity and the fact that he was complex but likable,” Morgan has said. Meanwhile, O’Connor’s co-star on the series, Olivia Colman, also praised him for his on-screen tenderness. “Fragility, sparkle, strength, doubt: It’s all there in a second. Every scene we had together became my favourite scene,” she said. Since The Crown, O’Connor has worked in both British and international film projects, including Eva Husson’s Mothering Sunday (2021) and Luca Guadagnino’s Challengers (2024), opposite Zendaya. The latter marked a shift in his public image, recasting him as an unlikely heartthrob and central figure in what social media dubbed the “hot rodent” trend – a celebration of sharp-featured, offbeat male leads. Today, he’s a gen Z pin-up and one of “the internet’s finest boyfriends” – and his star will only rise. Wake Up Dead Man, which boasts a stellar cast including Daniel Craig, Andrew Scott, Mila Kunis and Kerry Washington, is the biggest movie of his career. He’s also starring in Steven Spielberg’s next blockbuster, and will be making a return to the London stage in Golden Boy at the Almeida. If the past few years established him, the next will probably confirm it: Josh O’Connor is about to be everywhere."
culture_2025_nov_03_big-trouble-in-little-berlin-the-tiny-hamlet-split-in-two-by-the-cold-war.txt,culture,2025-11-03,John Kampfner,Big trouble in ‘Little Berlin’: the tiny hamlet split in two by the cold war,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/03/big-trouble-in-little-berlin-the-tiny-hamlet-split-in-two-by-the-cold-war,"A creek so shallow you barely got your ankles wet divided a community for more than four decades. By an accident of topography, the 50 inhabitants of Mödlareuth, a hamlet surrounded by pine forests, meadows and spectacular vistas, found themselves at the heart of the cold war. They had the misfortune to straddle Bavaria, in West Germany, and Thuringia in the East, a border that was demarcated first by a fence and then by a wall. American soldiers called it Little Berlin. Months after their own wall was breached, and even before their country had reunified in 1990, a group of local people set about memorialising their history. The work is about to come to fruition: on 9 November, the 36th anniversary of the fall of the (big) Berlin Wall, the German-German Museum Mödlareuth will open. It was officially inaugurated by the federal president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in early October, but the exhibition wasn’t quite ready. Addressing the villagers who lived through the old days, Steinmeier said: “You were witnesses of an inhuman division, which ripped families apart and turned neighbours into aliens.” Even at its founding in 1810, the village cut across the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Principality of Reuss, a princely house best known for giving all its male members the name Heinrich and numbering them sequentially by birth. As Steinmeier told the audience, the quirk never stood in the way of the inhabitants drinking in the same pub, attending the same church and sending their children to the same school. Then came the second world war. As soon as they arrived, the Russians erected wooden posts by the stream. For a year they took over the entire village, establishing their command in a house on the Bavarian side, adorning it with a picture of Stalin and a red star. The Americans convinced them to withdraw back over the brook. For a while, villagers could still hop over, though as restrictions tightened they were required to show ID, even though everyone knew who they were, and to return at night. Then, in 1952, came barbed wire and the formal closing of the border. In 1966, as in Berlin five years earlier, a wall was built, with mines, tank traps and guard posts. The villagers could still see each other by climbing hills, but on the eastern side waving and shouting were prohibited. One woman was put on a Stasi watch list for responding “same to you” to a (Bavarian) villager who wished her “happy new year”. I was told stories such as these by Robert Lebegern, the museum’s director, who has spent much of his working life creating it. Villagers were consulted early on about how much wall they wanted to preserve. They chose a stretch on the western fringe, close to where one of their own managed to escape in the dead of night with a ladder, after which the border was heavily reinforced. Two watchtowers are preserved alongside a series of tableaux depicting the most dramatic dates in the village’s history. As we walk, Lebergen lists the regulations: nobody could come within 5km of the border. Farmers needed special permission to tend to their crops; the husband or wife could work the combine harvester but never both, in case they tried to make a run for it. Armed guards stood watch. The border between West Germany and the GDR stretched 1,400km, from the Baltic Sea in the north to here in the south. Berlin is remembered and memorialised the most, but more than twice as many people (well over 300) died trying to cross it in rural areas than in the big city. Lebegern reminds me that 95% of escape attempts failed. Most of Mödlareuth’s villagers were farmers or craftsmen, who adjusted to living in the grey zone between two ideological spheres by keeping their heads down and looking after their fields. They neither supported the communist regime nor resisted it, Lebegern explains. For visitors, however, the hamlet became a kind of pilgrimage. About 15,000 came to visit every year, binoculars in hand, to gawp – and then quickly leave. In 1983, the US vice-president, George Bush, was shown around by the German defence minister. Twenty five years after reunification, Tannbach, a TV series about a fictional village resembling Mödlareuth, led to renewed interest. The opening of the new museum – with a cafe, shop, cinema room and large car park – is likely to provide a further boost. Will it change the village? It is, in any case, changing all the time. Some of the original inhabitants on both sides have died; others have left. Newcomers have moved in, including a man from Leicestershire called Darren. His German wife, Kathrin, is a traffic cop for the Bavarian police. They live up a hill, past a chicken coop, on the Thuringia side. The village is still divided, administratively at least, with different car number plates and postcodes. When Steinmeier visited, he was accompanied by the state premiers of both Bavaria and Thuringia. And when his foot crossed the brook, he was formally handed over by one police force to the other. History has moved on; the border has not. • This article was amended on 3 November 2025. George Bush was vice-president, not president, when he visited in 1983."
culture_2025_nov_04_celebrities-speaking-out-trump-jennifer-lawrence-robert-de-niro.txt,culture,2025-11-04,Jesse Hassenger,De Niro to JLaw: should celebrities be expected to speak out against Trump?,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/04/celebrities-speaking-out-trump-jennifer-lawrence-robert-de-niro,"If you were hoping Jennifer Lawrence might be able to tell you who to vote for and why, you’re in for some disappointment. “I don’t really know if I should,” the actor told the New York Times recently when asked about speaking up about the second Trump administration – and she’s not the only one. “I’ve always believed that I’m not here to tell people what to think,” Sydney Sweeney recently told GQ, after a year in which she was the subject of controversy over a jeans ad and a possible Republican voter registration. This marks a shift from Donald Trump’s first term, when more celebrities seemed not just comfortable speaking out against the administration, but obligated to do so. Now voters will no longer be able to so easily consult with Notes-app-made posts on Instagram to decide who and what they care about before they head to the polls. The era of movie-star-swung elections has come to an end. Of course, this era didn’t really exist in earnest. Celebrity opinion doesn’t seem to hold much genuine sway over the public, with the possible exception of the segments of each that belong to Taylor Swift. (Call that an extremely vocal plurality, if not necessarily a majority.) If it did, the George Clooney/Jennifer Lawrence/Tom Hanks/Scarlett Johansson party would soundly thump the Dean Cain/Tim Allen/James Woods/Chuck Norris party in every contest. In her recent interview, Lawrence is speaking to precisely that point, albeit without invoking any catty status differences: “As we’ve learned, election after election, celebrities do not make a difference whatsoever on who people vote for,” she continues. “So then what am I doing [when speaking out against Trump]? I’m just sharing my opinion on something that’s going to add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart.” Lawrence still isn’t actually shy about confirming her feelings (“The first Trump administration was so wild and just, ‘how can we let this stand?’” she says earlier in the interview, and she alludes to the dispiriting feeling when some voters actively chose a second term after seeing the results of the first). Sweeney, for her part, is more genuinely evasive. (“I’m just here to kind of open their eyes to different ideas. That’s why I gravitate towards characters and stories that are complicated and are maybe morally questionable, and characters that are – on the page – hard to like, but then you find the humanity underneath them.”) But the effect is similar: putting the work first and doing that shut-up-and-sing thing that has been thrown around, in some form another, for half a century or more but felt particularly amped-up around the George W Bush administration, when applied to the artists formerly known as the Dixie Chicks, among others. To some extent, Lawrence is correct to advocate for her work as more potentially meaningful than issuing a statement that underlines her celebrity status, noting that her political views are pretty easy to read in terms of what her production company puts out into the world (including a documentary about abortion bans), and what she does as a performer: “I don’t want to start turning people off to films and to art that could change consciousness or change the world because they don’t like my political opinions,” she says elsewhere in the interview. “I want to protect my craft so that you can still get lost in what I’m doing, in what I’m showing.” In other words, it’s the artistic principle of “show, don’t tell” bleeding over into politics. More personally, who wouldn’t grow exhausted by the expectation that these opinions should be publicly expressed and available for judgment and nitpicking, and prefer instead to speak through art, if that alternate platform was available to them? Trump doesn’t consume art, but he does perform the old-media equivalent of constant name-searching, which means he is likely to name-check any celebrities with high-profile opposition to him – or even those he senses are somehow aligned with his movement, like Sweeney, whose jeans ad he nonsensically praised. Getting dragged into the Trump sphere is a real lose-lose proposition for anyone who wants a genuinely interesting career in the arts. If that sense of self-preservation spares us some cookie-cutter awards show speeches that don’t move the needle outside of the auditorium applause-o-meter, or Clooney relitigating the specifics of Democrats’ mistakes and pitfalls in the 2024 election, all the better. The other side of that strategy, though, is a form of quivery brand management that doubles as faulty market research, implying a tidy split between Trump supporters and those who oppose the president’s policies. In fact, 77 million voters pulling the metaphorical lever for Trump in 2024 out of approximately 258 million adults in the US equals a less-than-robust 30%, not 50 – a percentage his approval rating has rarely crossed. Currently, that number continues to sit below 40% by most estimates. Maybe that’s splitting hairs; 77 million voters is a hell of a lot of people, and 37% of 258 million is even more than that, even if it’s not a majority. But the gesture toward “lowering the temperature”, as so many including Lawrence allude to, feels less noble and more businesslike capitulation. Personal politics becomes a choice between allowing people to read between the lines (as Lawrence does) or an outright opacity (like Sweeney’s) that is, ironically, very politician-like. It also fits with an executive mindset that treats audiences more like shareholders than human beings. As little as celebrity advocacy tends to move the needle on broad political decisions, and likely more effectively moved toward particular issues rather than tilting at the windmills erected by specific politicians, it’s also cathartic to see which folks aren’t backing down. It is telling, too, that some of the most outspoken figures are those closer to Trump’s advanced age. Harrison Ford, for example, had no compunction about telling the Guardian that he considers Trump one of history’s biggest criminals. Robert De Niro has gone further as an anti-Trump spokesperson, recently noting that he was “very happy” to see so many mobilizing against Trump at recent No Kings protests, and repeatedly bringing up his concern that Trump will not abide by the legal term limits on his presidency: “We cannot let up because he is not going to leave the White House. Anybody who thinks, ‘Oh, he’ll do this, he’ll do that,’ is just deluding themselves.” Does anyone need to hear this alarm sounded by De Niro in particular? Probably not, and surely some former fans will dismiss him as an anti-Trump crank. But at 82, the actor is too late in his career to spend much time calculating what is best for business, which also inures him from charges of empty virtue-signaling. He is clearly saying this stuff because he fully believes it. It’s not that De Niro needs Lawrence, Sweeney or whoever else to stand alongside him, but for all the strangeness of a legendary actor reinventing himself as a cable-news staple, it does seem like De Niro better understands his fellow baby boomer New Yorker. He especially seems to get that Trump is a poisonously ironic figure to inspire this kind of celebrity silence. This president is himself a celebrity first, a corrupt politician second, and an actual political strategist in a distant and possibly accidental third. He may well survey his presidency and secretly conclude that his greatest triumph was asserting that celebrity over others – to get away with literally telling people how to think and how to vote (or maybe in the future, that voting is no longer necessary) while cowing others from expressing their opinions on the matter. If celebrities had no political sway at all, Trump would be doddering and leering his way around a TV studio. Lawrence and Sweeney are right to aspire toward their work saying more than they do – but maybe not for the reasons they think. Celebrity without art is what gets you Donald Trump in the first place. For this administration, it’s not the singing that’s important; it’s the shutting up."
culture_2025_nov_04_late-night-hosts-jon-stewart-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel-seth-meyers.txt,culture,2025-11-04,Guardian staff,Jon Stewart on Trump’s Gatsby party: ‘The theme was apparently gross income inequality’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/04/late-night-hosts-jon-stewart-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel-seth-meyers,"Late-night hosts reacted to Donald Trump Great Gatsby-themed Halloween party held just hours before millions of Americans lost their food stamp benefits. Jon Stewart On the Daily Show, Jon Stewart mocked House speaker Mike Johnson’s insistence that Trump is “desperate for Snap benefits to flow to the American people”, even as his administration let the largest food assistance program in the nation, supporting around 42 million Americans, lapse during the government shutdown. Stewart played a clip of Johnson assuring that Trump “is a big-hearted president”. “Is he? Big-hearted? Loves us?” Stewart replied. “Because again, and maybe I’m misinterpreting it, but he did just recently dump diarrhea on all of us.” Stewart then played Trump’s infamous AI video in which he is depicted dumping feces on New York protesters. “He cares a lot about the American people,” Stewart deadpanned. “Maybe that is out of love. I don’t know.” Even worse, Trump held a Great Gatsby-themed Halloween party at Mar-a-Lago this weekend, hours before the Snap benefits expired. The party “once and for all shows that Donald Trump doesn’t give a fuck about even looking like he gives a fuck at all”, Stewart declared. “On the very night Snap benefits ended, Trump threw a Great Gatsby-themed ode to decadence and hedonism that even Jeffrey Epstein would have thought was a little over the top,“ he continued. “There were dancers, costumes, champagne – a wonderful celebration where the theme was apparently gross income inequality. “The slogan of the party, as people were losing their food benefits was, I shit you not, ‘a little party never killed nobody,’” he fumed. “Did you even read the Great Gatsby?! Spoiler alert, the party killed somebody! Two-bodies! How do you not know that? I knew that, and I’ve only read the Cliff notes. “Usually at a time of national suffering, there’s a generally accepted principle in leadership that you at least pretend to feel the pain of the people that you represent,” he added. “But this president seems to go out of his way to let struggling Americans know that he is doing very well.” Stewart pointed to Trump’s $300m gilded ballroom project, as yet another example of his lack of pretense. “Your premiums may be going up, tariffs may be shutting down your small businesses, you may be losing your food assistance, but it’ll all OK because Donald Trump is building a ballroom that looks like the inside of Marie Antoinette’s vagina,” he joked. Stephen Colbert “There are so many bad parts of a government shutdown, but the worst so far is that as of this weekend, nearly 42 million Americans have lost their food stamp benefits,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show on the 34th day of the government shutdown, with no end in sight. “No one should understand the importance of daily meals more than Donald Trump,” he added. “Hungry is his favorite emotion. It’s his whole thing – Trump and food is like JFK and sex, or Thomas Jefferson and sex, or Lincoln and his hat, which he had sex with.” Last week, the Trump administration claimed that it couldn’t use US Department of Agriculture emergency funds for Snap benefits. But on Friday, a federal judge directed the administration to use them anyway for the month of November. “Of course, like all good news during the Trump administration, he managed to make it bad,” said Colbert, as the administration has since said that it will only partially fund Snap, and it could take months because it declined to dip into other contingency pots to find the full $8bn required to fund the program. “So Trump and his people are sitting on a pile of money while American children go hungry, just so they can put pressure on Democrats,” Colbert summarized. Jimmy Kimmel On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host noted that Trump’s “disapproval rating” is 63%. “And what do you do when you have a terrible approval rating? You throw the most ill-timed, tone-deaf Halloween party imaginable,” he said of Trump’s Gatsby bash – “a theme you would select only if you’ve never read the Great Gatsby. “You know, throwing a party at your private golf club where the theme is rich white people hours before millions of Americans are set to lose their food assistance might be the Trumpiest Trump move of all time,” he said. “It felt like the last big bash before the Epstein files come out.” Nevertheless, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT.” “That’s true, he doesn’t want them to go hungry,” Kimmel responded. “He just wants them to lose their health insurance. He wants them to eat, but health insurance? No.” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers touched on Trump’s redecoration of a White House bathroom to befit his garish style – all white marble, with gold finishes. Trump called the changes “very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln”. “I would love to know how Trump came to the conclusion that the changes were ‘appropriate for the time of Lincoln’,” Meyers laughed. “Does he think Lincoln was a high-roller who loved gold trash cans? Every story I’ve heard about Lincoln is like ‘he did his homework with a lump of coal on the back of a shovel in the pouring rain.’ Or ‘did you know he put himself through law school by eating mud for eight cents a day?’ But to hear Trump talk, Lincoln was like, what, best friends with Hugh Hefner?” Trump has also posted repeatedly about the renovation on Truth Social. “Look, it’s never normal to obsess over a new bathroom, but it’s especially crazy to obsess over a luxurious new bathroom right as tens of millions of Americans are facing uncertainty over food assistance,” said Meyers. “What we should be talking about instead is the government shutdown you’re not solving or the food assistance you refuse to fund,” he added. “Working families are struggling while you renovate your bathroom or you build your ballroom, and that’s why your approval ratings are in the toilet.”"

A feature film about the diva puppet is in the works at Disney, which owns the rights to the Muppets franchise, Variety reported on Wednesday. Lawrence and Stone will serve as producers, working with a script from Oh, Mary! creator Cole Escola. “I don’t know if I can announce this but I am just going to … Emma Stone and I are producing a Miss Piggy movie and Cole is writing it,” Lawrence revealed on Las Culturistas podcast hosted by Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers. When the excited cohosts asked whether Lawrence and Stone, longtime friends and two of the most successful film actors of their generation, would co-star in the project, Lawrence teased: “I think so. We have to … It’s fucked up [that we haven’t done a movie together].” Lawrence also revealed that she considered making her Broadway debut in Oh, Mary!, Escola’s historical farce that has seen a range of actors from Jane Krakowski and Tituss Burgess fill the role of Mary Todd Lincoln. The intensely physical comedy, for which Escola won the Tony for best actor in a play, reimagines the former first lady as a historically clueless, alcoholic, aspiring cabaret singer who benefits greatly from her husband’s assassination. “The whole thing is a joke she’s in on,” Lawrence told the podcast. “I felt like I could be big and in on the joke.” She decided not to pursue the role, she said, after considering the physical rigor of Broadway’s punishing eight-shows-a-week schedule. “I don’t think I would be good at [theater] … It’s all your body and voice,” she said. “The only time I wanted to do theater was I wanted to do Oh, Mary! They were like, ‘It’s eight shows a week and six weeks of rehearsal.’ I was like, ‘Do you have daycare there?’ It just wouldn’t have worked.” Lawrence is currently promoting Die, My Love, a psychological thriller of a crumbling marriage in which she stars opposite Robert Pattinson. Stone’s latest film, Bugonia, a dark conspiracy theory comedy that marks her fifth collaboration with director Yorgos Lanthimos, premiered last month; she won her second best actress Oscar, in 2024, for her role in Lanthimos’s Poor Things. The Miss Piggy feature film, should it materialize, will be the character’s first solo outing since Jim Henson debuted her in 1976. The prima donna started as a chorus pig on Henson’s The Muppet Show before gradually becoming a bigger part of the series, and stealing the spotlight from her froggy beau Kermit. As the Muppets characters celebrate their 70th year, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg announced last month that they would refresh The Muppet Show for its 50th anniversary. A Disney+ special, featuring guest star Sabrina Carpenter, will air in 2026, with an expected new series to follow."

Most Americans’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/05/stephen-colbert-trump-pelosi,"Late-night hosts looked back on comments made by Nancy Pelosi about Donald Trump and examined the last-minute campaigning for the New York mayoral race. Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke about the big night for New York. He said that election night in the US is known internationally as “Guys, come look, they’re about to do something stupid!” He spoke about Zohran Mamdani’s late campaign push, hitting multiple clubs and bars in an episode that was taped just before the Democratic candidate made history winning the majority of votes. His major competition, Andrew Cuomo, picked up endorsements from Elon Musk, Eric Adams, George Santos and Stephen Miller, AKA “everyone New Yorkers love”. Colbert also joked that support came from “subway seat puddle” and “your neighbour with the trumpet”. This week also saw Nancy Pelosi call Donald Trump a “vile creature” and the “worst thing on the face of the Earth”. Colbert said that would place him in between “eating half your sandwich before realising it’s moldy” and “that fish in the Amazon that swims up your peehole”. He added: “You know who agrees with Nancy Pelosi? Most Americans.” Because this week a new opinion poll was published showing that Trump has reached a new second-term low in his approval rating with a showing of 37%, down from 47% in mid-February. The week also saw the death of Dick Cheney, at the age of 84. Colbert said that his family are “asking well-wishers, in lieu of flowers, to please shoot a friend in the face”. Jimmy Kimmel On Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host spoke about the California vote over redistricting, joking that whatever the result was, “Trump’s just gonna redraw everything with a Sharpie himself”. The president has already called the vote “unconstitutional” and “a giant scam”, which Kimmel said were “also adjectives someone might use to describe him”. He moved on to the New York mayoral race, calling Eric Adams a “clownishly funny” mayor who will next be seen on Dancing With the Stars. It was also day 35 of the government shutdown and Trump has threatened to delay Snap benefits, something his press secretary had to walk back immediately. It would affect 42 million people, a sign of callousness that explains why “his kids are like that”. Kimmel added: “The guy who never missed a happy meal in his life is deciding who gets to eat in this country.” The administration was ultimately forced into an agreement to pay half and it all led Kimmel to announce that he would be helping local organisations with a “big beautiful food bank” in the studio’s parking lot, asking viewers for food donations. Trump was also asked this week about former prince Andrew being stripped of his royal title as a result of the Jeffrey Epstein association. He told reporters he felt “very badly” for the royal family. Kimmel said it was “like Bill Cosby feeling bad for R Kelly” and there were also dozens of photos of Trump and Andrew together. Ticket sales at the Kennedy Center have also plummeted since Trump took over and demanded less “woke” programming with sales at 57%, down from 93% this time last year. “Everything he touches dies,” Kimmel said before joking: “Good news, Melania, you’re gonna live forever.” Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also spoke about the big New York election day, talking about a recent CNN profile of Mamdani’s wife. “Bad news ladies, he’s married, and even worse news, Cuomo isn’t,” he joked. This week has also seen Trump threatening possible military action in Nigeria on social media which led the Pentagon head, Pete Hegseth, to reply: “Yes, sir.” Meyers called it “gross” and said they were “like those couples who wish each other happy anniversary on Facebook”. Sotheby’s is also set to auction off a sculpture of a solid gold toilet called America, which led Meyers to joke: “I don’t know if that’s fair though since the toilet actually works.”"

While Picnic at Hanging Rock remains his finest work, his foray into Hollywood culminated in the utterly transfixing, intermittently horrifying Jim Carrey vehicle The Truman Show. Almost 30 years after its theatrical release, the film has only grown in stature and prescience. Ostensibly a dark satire on voyeurism and the inexhaustible manipulations of the media, The Truman Show predated the television juggernaut Big Brother by a single year, and it’s hard not to see something causal in that. Both are about surveillance and the murky line separating reality from entertainment; both involve hidden cameras watching the participants’ every move. The key difference – the one that gives the film such moral potency – is that Truman doesn’t know he’s on TV. The film follows Truman Burbank, an insurance salesman whose entire life takes place not on the island of Seahaven as he believes, but on an elaborate film set. His family, including his perky wife, Meryl (Laura Linney), best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich), and even his mother (Holland Taylor), are paid actors desperate to keep the illusion alive and the show on air. Pulling the strings is the God-like Christof (Ed Harris), who directs the show from the “moon”. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning When the film begins, Truman already longs for a way out while pining for Sylvia (Natascha McElhone), the girl who got away – or rather was shipped off set for screwing with Christof’s casting plans. Seahaven’s antiseptic cleanliness and sunny palette may obscure its insidious, monocultural grip. But as Truman’s suspicions grow, and the community conspires to keep him both ignorant and imprisoned, things get very dark indeed. It’s the creepiest film in full light I know (and yes, I’ve seen Midsommar). The first sign comes, in the opening minutes, from the heavens: a large stage light falls from the sky, smashing on to the street outside Truman’s cookie-cutter house. The interruptions continue from a mixed radio signal to a false elevator, and we find ourselves cheering Truman on as he forces open the doors of perception. Christof – with a fascistic tendency to throw his actors under the bus – tries the soft power of diplomacy first, sending Truman’s wife and mother as agents of compliance. When they fail, Christof sends the deadliest weapon in his arsenal: the best friend. It’s in this central scene that Weir shows his allegorical hand. Marlon placates Truman with the undeniable lure of fraternity: “Think about it, Truman. If everyone was in on it, I’d have to be in on it too.” But he’s being fed his lines directly by the repugnant Christof. We are in the world of the Stasi, of an authoritarianism that infects the domestic sphere, poisons the very words coming out of our mouths, and Emmerich, as Marlon, brilliantly captures the moral price the conformist pays to maintain the status quo. All the horrors of political supplication are written on his face. Carrey is sublime, and we can be thankful Weir waited a full year in pre-production to secure him. His cheesy grin and “good afternoon, good evening and good night” evoke the gee-willikers optimism of 50s middle America, and he’s so perfectly in sync with the simulated world around him that his doubt and determination once the veil drops feel almost revolutionary. Carrey’s precision as a comic performer creates a flawless carapace under which his existential essence seethes. One of the miracles of The Truman Show is the way it trades in both the allure and the artifice of cinema; it’s like a magician revealing mid-trick what’s up their sleeve. Production designed to within an inch of its life and equally emotionally contrived, Seahaven still seduces because it plays as much on our fears as our dreams. It’s no accident Christof has to invoke lifelong phobias in Truman to keep him “safe”. Rewatching it now, Weir’s masterpiece feels less about voyeurism and the entertainment industry and more about the individual and their relationship to the state. We’ve created a world of pure solipsism, where we are all our own Truman and Christof combined, endlessly editing and curating our lives in the hope someone’s watching. But we are still in thrall to an economic model that sees everything for sale; remember The Truman Show can only exist because its world is littered top to toe with product placement. It’s a hermetically sealed ecosystem of wealth promotion that rides roughshod over the rights of the individual. Sound familiar? The Truman Show is streaming on Stan (Australia) and available to rent (US/UK). For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia, click here"
culture_2025_nov_06_edward-jenner-vaccine-garden-shed-heritage-at-risk-register.txt,culture,2025-11-06,Mark Brown,Garden shed of vaccine pioneer Edward Jenner added to heritage at risk register,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/06/edward-jenner-vaccine-garden-shed-heritage-at-risk-register,"A rustic, ordinary-looking English garden hut regarded as the birthplace of immunology – revolutionising global public health and saving countless lives – has been added to the nation’s heritage at risk register. The hut belonged to Edward Jenner (1749-1823), regarded as someone who has saved more lives than any other human. It was there that he first trialled a vaccine for smallpox in the late 18th century. The hut, built from brick and rubble stone with a simple thatched roof, was christened “the Temple of Vaccinia” by Jenner. Today the structure in Gloucestershire is in a sorry state and is one of 138 buildings and sites added by Historic England to its annual heritage at risk register. The register is regarded as a useful snapshot of the health of England’s historic places, with 129 taken off the list this year including the ornate and spectacular Papplewick pumping station in Nottingham, which is considered a “Victorian engineering marvel”. Claudia Kenyatta, the co-chief executive of Historic England, said it was astonishing to think Jenner’s hut had played such an important part in history. It was effectively “the world’s first vaccination clinic”, she said. “It’s a really good example of how going on to the heritage at risk register can be a helpful moment to bring profile and attention and focus and skills to these really important places.” It was outside the hut in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, that local villagers lined up to have their arms scratched with a lancet in order to receive the first smallpox vaccine. At the time it was widely known that contracting cowpox, a relatively mild disease, would prevent you from getting smallpox, a deadly contagion. Jenner scraped pus from the cowpox-blistered hands of a milkmaid and inserted it into a cut in the skin of an eight-year-old boy. He then exposed the boy to smallpox and, when the child showed no signs of infection, the world changed. Owned by a charitable trust, the hut needs urgent repairs to its thatched roof, rear wall and chimney to secure its future, said Kenyatta. Other places added to the register this year include: • The Hill Garden pergola on Hampstead Heath in London. Constructed in 1906, the long raised walkway was a feature of the stunning private garden created for the Bolton soap magnate and philanthropist William Lever (Lord Leverhulme). • The St Wendreda’s church in March, Cambridgeshire. This is the only church in the UK dedicated to the 7th-century Anglo-Saxon princess-saint. The church bells can no longer be rung because the roof is at risk of collapse. • Two buildings at Cromford Mills, Matlock, Derbyshire. The two at-risk cottages are part of a site considered the birthplace of the modern factory system. It was at Cromford in the 1770s that Richard Arkwright created the world’s first successful water-powered cotton spinning mill. The register is seen as a way of focusing minds and encouraging people to come up with ways of reusing historic buildings. “Going on the register can be a really positive thing,” said Kenyatta. “It can often be a catalyst to bring people together and begin to find solutions to some of these really important buildings and places.” Among the saved sites this year are Bruce Grove public toilets in Tottenham, north London, constructed in 1910 and a rare survivor of its type. They became derelict in the 1980s but have been rejuvenated with a cafe, community space and, naturally, new public toilets. In Gloucester, the largest surviving timber-framed townhouse in England has been repaired and now contains an antiques centre. In Cumbria, the Augill smelting mill near the A66 has been saved through recent conservation works, Historic England said, “allowing for volunteer training, community engagement and more local understanding of the mining landscape”. The heritage minister Fiona Twycross said it was fantastic to see so many historical sites saved for communities. “These are much-loved places and it is great to see them being brought back in to use,” said the Labour peer. “This year alone our £15m heritage at risk capital fund has been key to saving buildings like these.”"
culture_2025_nov_06_seth-meyers-zohran-mamdani-democrats-trump.txt,culture,2025-11-06,Guardian staff,Seth Meyers on Mamdani’s win: ‘The kind of energy Democrats have been desperately seeking for years’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/06/seth-meyers-zohran-mamdani-democrats-trump,"Late-night hosts reacted to Democrats’ slate of wins across the country and Zohran Mamdani’s historic victory in the New York City mayoral race. Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers celebrated Mamdani’s historic victory in the New York mayoral race, becoming the first south Asian and Muslim mayor of the biggest city in the US, as well as New York’s first mayoral candidate since 1969 to receive more than a million votes. “This is the kind of energy Democrats have been desperately seeking for years,” said an enthusiastic Meyers. “I haven’t seen a crowd of New Yorkers this excited since the time the real Timotheé Chalamet stopped at a Timotheé Chalamet lookalike contest in Manhattan. “And if you thought Trump was bummed about the results before Mamdani’s speech, he probably felt even worse” when he heard Mamdani say: “Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up!” “OK, first of all, you do not need to tell him to turn the volume up,” Meyers joked. “He’s a 79-year-old Fox News addict, you know the volume is maxed out. “Mamdani correctly calculated that standing up to Trump was a better political strategy than whatever this is,” he continued, cutting to a clip of the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer – a New York establishment Democrat who did not endorse Mamdani – droning on about “Kentucky fried french fries” at a press conference. Asked who he voted for, Schumer declined to specify, instead saying: “Look, I voted, and I look forward to working with the next mayor to help New York City.” “You’re the Democratic leader, and you won’t even say you voted for the Democratic nominee?” Meyers fumed. “Why are you treating it like a secret? “Things happen here, and they happen fast,” he said in a final ode to New York. “How fast? A dude who was polling at 1% a year ago was just elected mayor, and that’s what makes New York City great. And if you can’t hear the resounding message voters sent last night, then maybe you should” – to quote Mamdani – “turn the volume up.” Stephen Colbert “I don’t know about you guys, but tonight my heart is full of something I have not felt in almost a year, and that is … good?” said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show, his first since Democrats swept races across the country, offering a sharp rebuke of the Trump administration. “Today Democrats are walking around with a spring in their step like a divorced mom in her 40s whose new haircut just got her carded at two different bars,” he joked. Colbert also celebrated Mamdani’s win in New York. The 34-year-old state assemblyman “didn’t just defeat Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, he nut-punched New York’s fattest cats”, he said. “The billionaires had the knives out for Zohran, pumping massive amounts of cash into anti-Mamdani groups. I’m talking big-roll high-rollers,” including the cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, son of Estée, who donated $2.6m to stop him; hedge fund investor Bill Ackman, who spent $1.75m on anti-Mamdani campaigns; and Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, who spent $2m. “So it’s a bad day for billionaires,” said Colbert. “Or as it’s also known, still a pretty good day! They’re still billionaires.” Speaking to supporters after clinching the victory, Mamdani offered a different political vision than the federal government in Washington. “In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light,” he said. “And as always, the port authority will be the smell,” Colbert added. Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel cheered on the Democrats’ many wins on Tuesday. “We needed a big night,” he said. “Democrats have had fewer wins this year than the Jets. “This was not a good night for the president,” he continued. “Everything he touched was a loser. Trump hasn’t been this embarrassed since there was a Donald Trump Jr.” “But if you’re tired of all the losing, fear not! He’s got an excuse,” Kimmel said. “In fact, he’s got two of them.” Trump wrote on Truth Social: “TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT. AND SHUTDOWN. WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT.” “Now, if Republicans had won and he wasn’t on the ballot, would he take credit for that?” Kimmel responded. “Oh yes, he definitely would.” Trump then posted “… AND SO IT BEGINS!” – “which was either a response to Mamdani winning the mayoral race, or he just sat down on the toilet, I don’t know,” said Kimmel. “I mean, seriously, what is that supposed to mean? What would motivate him to post ‘and so it begins’ at almost midnight?” Kimmel then pivoted to the government shutdown, now the longest in US history at 37 days. “Trump has been desperately trying to convince anyone who will listen that Democrats are responsible for the shutdown and that it has nothing to do with him trying to hide the Epstein files,” he said. “The gaslighting has reached a fever pitch, as Trump cuts off the supply of food to children, families, senior citizens, etc.” But, Kimmel said, the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, “wants you to know: just because they’re cutting off your food and want to cut off your health insurance, that doesn’t mean they don’t care”. As Johnson told reporters: “Every hardworking American in any place that’s missed a paycheck, anyone who has been made to suffer … anyone who is hurting, you have a home in the Republican party.” “Yes, you have a home in the Republican party!” Kimmel scoffed. “You’ll be living under the stairs like Harry Potter and you’re not allowed in the fridge, but you do have a home.”"

The curiously pristine SUVs are back in the garage, the cloaks are off to the dry cleaners and your favourite hits of the 80s and 90s are safe, for a few months at least, from those absurdly melodramatic cover treatments. Yes, The Celebrity Traitors is over, having served up a finale that had just the right amount of intrigue, double-crossing and slack-jawed looks to camera from the terminally outwitted. We won’t ruin things here for anyone who hasn’t watched it yet, but for a full spoiler-filled debrief you can read Lucy Mangan’s review of last night’s drama here. It was a fitting capstone to a remarkably successful first Celebrity Traitors outing. Fears that its big names might be too media-trained or overly deferential to one another – or just lacking the ruthlessness and desperation of their civilian equivalents, who actually need the win a fair bit more than the celebs do – proved unfounded. The show’s core appeal was still there, but in a supersized state. The casting managed to be preposterously starry – featuring at least half a dozen people who wouldn’t usually go within a 10-mile radius of a reality TV show – but also carefully consistent with the civvy edition’s usual mix of personality types. More broadly, the Traitors franchise is now in its imperial phase; a ratings hit in a post-ratings era, a format that it feels like everyone is watching and talking about, even if they’re not. But here we should probably insert a warning from history – history in this case meaning “two days ago on Channel 4”. Did you know that The Great British Bake Off crowned its 16th winner on Tuesday? If you didn’t, you can hardly be accused of living under a rock. There was barely an echo of the breathless, news-alert coverage that the series used to attract, and overnight ratings for this current bun run have been the lowest since its move to Channel 4 (and the lowest altogether since those early experimental series on the BBC with those infuriating cutaway segments on the history of suet pudding or whatnot). I don’t mean to have a dig at a redoubtable reality institution that, having launched just after the coalition government was formed, is now on its sixth prime minister. Bake Off is clearly still valued by Channel 4; those ratings, though low by the show’s standards, tower over the rest of the network’s output. But it does illustrate how perilously quickly a reality franchise can fade from view. Reality TV has a raw deal in this sense. With most scripted series (excluding soaps or procedurals like CSI) a limited shelf life is baked in, even encouraged. Reality TV, though, is expected to continue indefinitely – and then we inevitably lose interest in it, often due more to overfamiliarity than any major fault of its makers. Think of any reality format – the traffic-stopping, thinkpiece-prompting sensation that was Love Island, say – and it’s probably experienced a similar boom and bust. (I’m a Celebrity … and Strictly are curious exceptions – though the sheen seems to be coming off the latter.) All that can be done is to keep those boom times going a little longer, season by season. It’s certainly boom time for The Traitors, but the pitfalls are obvious. The episodes’ daily table-murder structure is vulnerable to feeling repetitive. The usual response to that fear from producers would be to introduce twists or MacGuffins – last season’s Seer power would be an example of the latter – which has the risk of making the series feel overly engineered or manipulated. And there’s the danger of contestants getting a little too familiar with how the game is played – though actually that has been a benefit to the celebrity series, with Jonathan Ross using his knowledge of the show’s many international formats to inform his Traitorly behaviour. But the biggest threat to the Traitors franchise is surely overexposure. Buried at the end of last night’s finale was an atmospheric, though essentially information-free, trail for the regular, original-flavour Traitors, coming soon on BBC One. It’s unclear how soon, but going by previous years it should be back as soon as the start of January. That’s an awful lot of Traitors in a short time for a show that had previously only occupied three nights a week for two months once a year. Other shows have doubled up and paid the price. Will viewers happily readjust to civvy Traitors, or will it feel underwhelming with the memory of Alan Carr and the other hyper-charismatic celeb traitors and faithfuls still fresh? These are good problems to have though, and producers Studio Lambert have talented people on staff to solve them. Season four of the series proper was filmed just a few months after the celebrity edition and no doubt was being constructed and tweaked with its celeb forerunner in mind. New ways of keeping an old game fresh will have been devised. And, most importantly of all, there will always be people, famous or otherwise, ready to make fascinating, maddening, completely engrossing decisions across a big, round table.

Seth Meyers Seth Meyers continued to analyze the results of Tuesday’s elections on Thursday evening, examining what fueled major victories for Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey. “If you do look inside the numbers, you’ll see that it wasn’t just anti-Trump backlash that fueled Democrats’ wins,” the Late Night host said. “Voters are also furious about the economy,” especially record-high grocery prices. “So the same thing that we were told was an issue in the last election was still an issue in this election because nothing has been fixed,” Meyers continued. “And voters are right – grocery prices are going up, everything from coffee to bananas to beef.” In fact, beef prices have never been higher. “Soon it’s going to get so bad that Trump’s going to start pushing Americans toward vegan options,” Meyers joked. But “don’t worry, Republicans, Trump is in touch with the common man,” he added. “That’s his gift. He knows what it’s like to go to the grocery store and feel the pain when you open your wallet and hand the cashier your ID and – wait, what?” Speaking from the White House, Trump claimed that “all we want is voter ID” at the grocery store. “You go to a grocery store, you have to give ID.” “Yeah, everyone knows you get carded at the grocery store,” Meyers deadpanned. “Trump has no idea what regular people are going through and he doesn’t care.” In fact, Trump insisted that grocery prices were going down in his recent interview with CBS News’s 60 Minutes. “You can lie about immigration, you can lie about the stock market, you can even lie about what wars you ended because most Americans will say ‘I didn’t even know that Thailand and Finland were at war,’” said Meyers. “But you can’t lie about the prices people see with their own eyes at the grocery store.” Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert checked in on the government shutdown, now the longest in US history at 38 days. “The shutdown has already wreaked havoc on air travel, and that havoc is about to get even reekier,” he said, as air traffic controllers aren’t being paid and many aren’t showing up to work. So many, in fact, that the Federal Aviation Administration has directed airlines to cut 10% of their flights at the busiest airports. “So unfortunately it may be time to try your new favorite airline: the bus,” Colbert joked. “If you’re traveling for Thanksgiving, you might want to leave now.” Colbert also touched on the major victories for Democrats on election day, which Trump referred to in a press conference as “an interesting evening and we learned a lot”. “That sounds like what you’d say after a Tinder date where someone had to go to the hospital,” Colbert laughed. In other news, Fifa – “whose job, you’ll recall, is to take bribes and regulate soccer”, Colbert joked – announced a new peace prize to be awarded at the World Cup draw in Washington. “Yes, the Fifa peace prize: it’s given exclusively to world leaders who stop wars using only their feet,” Colbert said. “So it really looks like a made-up award just to give Trump something,” he noted, though when asked to confirm that Trump would be given the award, Fifa president Gianni Infantino demurred, saying: “On the 5th of December, you will see.” “Man, it is going to be hilarious when they give it to Obama,” Colbert laughed. The Daily Show And on the Daily Show, Jordan Klepper recapped a dramatic White House press conference in which Trump announced a plan to cut the price of Ozempic and other pharmaceutical weight-loss drugs. “It’s all part of his campaign promise and his one consistent principle of ‘no fatties’,” Klepper joked. The press conference was “an event that turned into a major Hipaa violation”, as Trump announced the price cuts by singling out members of his administration who did or did not take weight-loss drugs. “Joking aside, obesity is a serious issue,” Klepper said. “So, this could be a benefit. Dr Oz, you’re a doctor, theoretically. Give us a reasonable expectation of success here.” Oz, the TV doctor turned Trump’s administrator for Medicare and Medicaid Services, boasted that Americans would “lose 135bn pounds by the midterms”. “Why the midterms?” Klepper wondered. “Did they add a swimsuit competition to those? “Look, I’m no mathematician,” he continued. “But 135bn pounds divided by 340 million Americans means we each have to lose … 400lb by the midterms. And I know that sounds like a lot, but remember: that’s just the average! Some people will lose 300lb, while other people will lose 500lb. Some of us will lose no pounds at all, which will be offset by everyone losing 800lb. “The point is, regardless of how much you lose, Donald Trump will be tracking it and announcing your personal results at a press conference.”"

culture_2025_nov_08_my-cultural-awakening-the-big-lebowski.txt,culture,2025-11-08,Banseka Kayembe,My cultural awakening: The Big Lebowski inspired me to embrace unemployment,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/08/my-cultural-awakening-the-big-lebowski,"Quitting your job in your 30s with no solid plan is generally considered poor decision-making. Doing it because you watched The Big Lebowski is probably even worse. But as I faced up to what would be my eighth year in an IT role, I watched Jeff Bridges meandering his way through the chaos of life in a dressing gown. And I found myself thinking: maybe the Dude had it figured out. For most of my working life, my identity has been strongly bolstered by work: doing well career-wise felt like evidence of my utility and respectability (despite the fact no one ever really understood what my job was anyway). And, like most millennials, I’d felt exceptionally lucky to eventually get a grad job out of university at all, especially one that paid more than a “living wage”. On top of that, as a second generation immigrant, I’d been repeatedly told from a young age that being jobless is a terrible state of affairs. I had been unhappy for some time, but leaving without a new role to go to had always seemed totally unthinkable. But life has a funny way of telling you when you’re no longer where you should be; against my will, I was moved to another department, with a nightmare boss. I then got another role where the colleagues were lovely, but the job felt deeply uncreative and uninteresting. Shortly after, senior leadership began talking about job cuts – it was clear we were expected to do just as much with even less. When two years earlier I’d watched the Coen Brothers’ 1998 classic The Big Lebowski, I’d spent much of it scrolling on my phone and then stupidly wondering why I wasn’t finding the film particularly interesting. But this summer, facing a dreaded project that I had almost no passion for, and with little else to distract me, I watched it properly for the first time. I was completely captivated. I watched it every day for a week, read bits of the script and scoured the internet for any half-decent podcasts about it, so I could figure out why a film that seemed so ridiculous also meant so much to me. A lot of people have described encountering “Dude-ism” as a quasi-religious experience, and there was certainly something philosophical about my sudden affection for the film. The attitude of Jeff Bridges’s bowling-obsessed slacker the Dude is to “take it easy” in a chaotic world that is constantly trying to push him into urgency and action. One of his antagonists, the philanthropist known as “the Big Lebowski”, represents the absurdity of modern, capitalist life, screaming “get a job sir!” and “the bums will always lose!” The Dude is treated by most as an unemployed waster against the backdrop of the 90s economic boom. But by the end of the film it’s difficult not to believe that the Dude is the one who’s really rich in life. He keeps his inner tranquility, despite all the madness around him. I knew I’d been losing myself, getting sucked into workplace politics or tasks that I didn’t care about any more. The final straw came in a meeting with a manager, where I was being encouraged to learn more skills for a role from which I was already mentally checking out. “What would the Dude do?” I asked myself. I already had my answer. Not everyone initially thought it was a great idea. “But what if your boiler broke down?” my mum exclaimed, having anxiously predicted any little thing that could go awry. Still, my mind was made up. I handed in my notice with nothing in particular lined up and an acceptance that life is full of “strikes and gutters”. One of the most strikingly beautiful aspects of The Big Lebowski is the bowling alley the Dude goes to, a space of habitual calm and simplicity. Since leaving I’ve reimmersed myself more in those small rituals of peace, repetition and community; cooking a meal from scratch in peace and quiet, grabbing a coffee with a friend to talk about nothing much at all. Outside the demands of full-time work, I’ve been able to remember what’s really important in life. I’m not exactly living like the Dude; after all I still have a mortgage to pay. For now, I’m living off the savings I built up from my old job, a small income from the media and education platform I’m continuing to fundraise for, and bits of journalism work on the side. I know much of that is a privilege – but I’m grateful to have the choice to live at a slower pace, on my own terms. And if you still think my decision to be jobless was a bad idea, well that’s just, like, your opinion, man."

culture_2025_nov_09_ambika-mod-porn-play-interview-josie-rourke-sophia-chetin-leuner.txt,culture,2025-11-09,Zoe Williams,‘We don’t want to leave people shocked and trembling’: inside the graphic new play tackling violent porn addiction,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/09/ambika-mod-porn-play-interview-josie-rourke-sophia-chetin-leuner,"In Sophia Chetin-Leuner’s Porn Play, which has just opened at London’s Royal Court, Ani is a 30-year-old academic at the frontier of intellectual discovery: she’s winning awards for her radical revision of John Milton’s Paradise Lost, effortlessly earning the admiration of her mentor and her students alike. She’s also addicted to violent pornography and is masturbating constantly. She can’t stay in a real-life sexual moment, but she can’t stay in a real-life conversation, either – constantly reaching for her phone, watching porn and wanking, often in situations just about believable yet so outlandishly wrong that reading the play, and observing Ani’s career and relationships unravel, is like being trapped in someone’s anxiety dream. So it’s quite a bold choice of role for the person playing Ani, Ambika Mod. Since starring in This Is Going to Hurt in 2022, but even more so since One Day last year, she has become known, in her words, “for playing very noble characters who die”. Mod has the world of romantic leads at her feet – a beautiful, relatable everywoman, who could tell you the truth of the human heart with one raised eyebrow. Starring in a play whose opening scene has her on all fours atop a mirror, in a frenzy of narcissistic delight, whose every action is centred on her body … well, it feels like it must have been a decision to wrestle with? “This is going to make me sound really crazy,” Mod says, “but actually no. My initial thoughts when I read the script were: ‘What a fucking great play, what a fucking great character, what an interesting thing that I’ve never seen before.’” Chetin-Leuner started writing Porn Play eight years ago, while she was on a scholarship at Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. She has a sweet, soft voice and demeanour, which seem almost comical when all you know of her is her play’s caustic dialogue. She says she wanted to write about porn, broadly, because “the internet has just ruined what, in essence, could be a really gorgeous exploration of different kinks. When you’re 12, which is the age that children start looking at pornography online now, the way algorithms work is they might start with one thing, but then it pushes more and more violence. By the time people are becoming sexually active, they’ve absorbed so much that it’s shaped their idea of intimacy, their sexual preferences, everything.” Some of the details in the play that might sound madly embellished – Ani has to go to the GP because she’s masturbated so much that she’s done herself a mischief – are actually drawn from real-life porn addicts Chetin-Leuner interviewed while she was in the US. Plenty has been written about this addiction, but almost all of it through a male lens, while in her research she found that women were much more likely than men to watch violent pornography (though it’s low single digits for either gender to search for non-consensual violence, according to the most often-cited study). But how on earth do you stage a play like this? Masturbation is such a private thing. Across the whole spectrum of possible ways you could portray it – from grotesque to erotic – there is something about turning that privacy inside out that is so confrontational as to amount to a kind of violence. Josie Rourke, the play’s director, is one of those people who you take one look at and think, “OK, she’s got this”, given her previous work as artistic director at London’s Donmar Warehouse theatre and, before that, the Bush. “One of the nice things about having been a theatre director for a couple of decades is that it’s possible for me to look at a scene very practically, thinking about how it’s going to be delivered,” she says. “Your brain is thinking: ‘How do we do that?’ using exactly the same technical bits that you’d use for, ‘How are we going to kill Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet?’” This isn’t Rourke’s first rodeo, which she illustrates with even less stageable moments in her career than 24/7 masturbation. In her 20s she directed Loyal Women, a play about the women’s wing of the Ulster Defence Association, in which someone had to be tarred and feathered. “There’s always another question, beyond ‘How do you get it to deliver?’, which is: ‘How do you make it eloquent?’” she says. “Although what occurs in the play is extremely graphic, how do we have the audience feel like the character, and not like they’re observing the character?” From Mod’s perspective, the challenge is part of the point. “Especially as a brown woman, you feel the push towards meekness, towards sexlessness, towards being a good girl. A personal desire of mine is that I want more mess in the characters I play, in the stories I tell.” It’s still on my mind that audiences might revolt. Ten years ago, I covered the scandal at the Royal Opera House, when there was nudity and a rape scene in Guillaume Tell, and the audience booed, people walked out. Rourke is unperturbed about this prospect, partly because the Royal Court is well known for pushing at boundaries, whether those are of decency, taste or simply the frame of what does and does not belong on stage. “Some people walked out of Look Back in Anger,” Rourke says (if you’ve forgotten the fine details, audience members audibly gasped at the sight of an ironing board on stage). “It’s not about sensationalism, it’s about this being a theatre you come to to understand what is occurring in the world, that may reach beyond our own experience. Tough stuff happens here.” And truly, Porn Play is about more than the impact of porn: how it flattens, homogenises, abstracts and finally disembodies sex, as it removes you from the world and the people in it. That is a backdrop, really, to other, searching questions in the play: about shame and grief; kink and authenticity; God and the patriarchy; Milton; Adam and Eve; addiction and relationships; how different generations bounce off each other. Indeed, part of Ani’s unravelling as an academic actually isn’t because she’s watching porn all day; it’s because she hits the hard edge of one of her gen Z student’s boundaries by describing rape as “sexy”. Arguing that she wasn’t calling it sexy, she was considering whether Milton was, does nothing to soften the exchange. It’s a perfect distillation of the condition of millennial womanhood; the first generation to have porn omnipresent through their sexual awakening, they’re policed by the conservatism of their elders, which still sees sexual destiny as a guy thing, while at the same time, the generation beneath them is more militant about consent, abuse, trauma and trigger warnings. The space in which millennial women can discuss desire is vanishingly small, and full of landmines. “We are not given the grace of nuance and complexity in any of our discussions,” Mod says – born in 1995, she is, like Ani, almost too young to be a millennial, but just too old for gen Z, which technically started in 1997. “It feels so healthy to sit in the swirl of this play, because outside it, binaries are becoming stronger and stronger. In the same way that pornography is very harmful, social media is also fucking us up.” Besides tearing up what you can and can’t say, Porn Play might also upend what you thought about Milton – classic patriarch, in art and in life, a man so violently domineering that his first wife left him because she couldn’t stand the sound of him beating his students over Latin grammar. Ani argues that in his portrait of Eve, in Paradise Lost, her worship of the serpent is essentially penis worship – her self-love is indivisible from her sexuality, and the fall is worth it. So the poem doesn’t just allow for female desire, it frames it as elementally powerful. If you squint a bit, Porn Play recasts Milton as a feminist sexual adventurer and philosopher of kink. Was that Chetin-Leuner’s intention? She approaches this obliquely: “I was talking to a lot of recovering sex and porn addicts, and loads of it was about religion,” she says. “They’d either come from really religious backgrounds, or they’d found religion as part of their recovery. I didn’t want to do a play about that, but I understood there’s something about the ultimate patriarch, God …” she tails off, I’m guessing because the thought ends somewhere blasphemous from both a religious and feminist perspective. “Anyway, that’s where Milton came in: he has this great quality, where his poetry shifts beneath your feet. Is he a proto-feminist or a horrible arsehole? Probably both.” Mod was raised a Hindu but isn’t particularly religious now, though she is spiritual. “We decided for Ani that she would have that same background and heritage, but I wanted to be really clear that I didn’t want her specialism in academia to be in any way tied to her own faith,” she says. Rourke was raised Roman Catholic, and says this play has uncovered “a childhood and teens that were spent being told how to worship, how to think about my body. The church needed to sit in between me and those ideas, not just in between me and God. “I think a lot about original sin,” she continues. “Is there a thing we can’t get out of ourselves? That we’re continually trying to? It makes immediate sense to people who went through that doctrine, and no sense at all to people who didn’t: you are told that there is this sin that you carry around from birth. There’s something about that that I find so evocative and profound.” In the end, the porn addiction is just that, an addiction: some of the most powerful scenes are the tragic, ugly loneliness of the addict, and the hero’s journey is, Mod says, “trying to get Ani to interact with the real world. Trying to get her back to a place where she remembered that she was loved. I don’t want to sound really pedestrian, but a lot of research on addiction, isn’t it always a search for love, for connection and intimacy?” But Ani’s arc is so much richer than an addict’s journey back into the world of healthy, responsible adults. Her basest instincts are interlaced throughout with her most truthful, her ugliest moments slide in and out of her noblest. Mod, Rourke and Chetin-Leuner never sound more similar than when they’re laughing about how many times they’ve been asked to make a female character more “likable”. “No one’s going, ‘Is Macbeth likable enough, though?’” Mod says. Chetin-Leuner “can’t believe people are still saying that about women in stories, but they are”. Rourke says that whenever she hears “likable” in a meeting, she says “heroic” at exactly the same time, “so that word sits above ‘likable’”. “A play is also a poetic space,” Rourke continues. “I don’t want anybody leaving Porn Play shocked and trembling; I want to open up the poetic space within their own sense of shame, their own sense of who they are. And for that, they have to have a heroic relationship to this character. She’s the hero of the play.” Porn Play is at the Royal Court theatre, London, to 13 December."
culture_2025_nov_09_groundbreaking-british-museum-show-set-to-challenge-samurai-myths.txt,culture,2025-11-09,Dalya Alberge,Groundbreaking British Museum show set to challenge samurai myths,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/09/groundbreaking-british-museum-show-set-to-challenge-samurai-myths,"A groundbreaking samurai exhibition that promises to challenge “everything we think we know about Japan’s warrior elite” spanning a millennium of myth and reality is to open at the British Museum next year. Titled Samurai, the blockbuster exhibition will reveal a world beyond armour-clad warriors and epic duels, as popularised by the noble, katana-wielding heroes of Akira Kurosawa’s classic action films and PlayStation’s hit video games. Much of the samurai myth – including even the word “samurai” – was invented long after their heyday, a modern phenomenon linked to mass media and pop culture. The exhibition, which opens in February, will also show that, far from being a male warrior cult, samurai women were educated, governed and even fought. Rosina Buckland, the exhibition’s lead curator, told the Guardian: “This is the first exhibition to tackle the myths. Most of the previous exhibitions have been about the ‘boys’ toys’, as I call them sometimes, somewhat facetiously – the weapons. “There have also been exhibitions, particularly in Japan, about the arts of the samurai. But this is trying to say that there’s a lot that is misunderstood and based on myth.” Recalling that the British Museum previously staged two exhibitions on samurai swords, she said: “Swords are important, but they are by no means the whole story. So this is going to be much bigger than has ever been attempted before … “What I want to address in the exhibition is the way that perception of the samurai has become narrowed down to just this male warrior in armour wielding a sword. “That’s a tiny part of what they were over hundreds of years. They were warriors in the beginning, but there was a balance between the military and the literary and the artistic. So that’s a huge part of the story.” She added: “This rediscovery of female samurai history reframes centuries of gendered myth and challenges the hyper-masculine image of the samurai that still dominates film, anime and gaming.” The samurai emerged in the 900s as mercenaries for the imperial court. They were formidable and fearsome warriors during the middle ages. They gained political dominance from the 1100s and, during a long era of peace from 1615, they became government officials, scholars and patrons of the arts. By the late 19th century, their hereditary status had been abolished as Japan modernised itself. The exhibition will feature more than 280 objects, many of which have never been seen in the UK before. It will also draw on the British Museum’s own collection – one of the largest outside Japan – whose objects are too delicate to be displayed permanently. As well as arms and armour, there will be paintings, woodblock prints, books, clothing and ceramics. “Because the samurai were elite, the best quality objects were made for them,” Buckland said. “Different types of clothing for samurai men and women differentiated them from the other classes in society. Most importantly, the men were allowed to wear two swords.” Exhibits to be seen for the first time include a spectacular suit of armour recently acquired by the British Museum. Its helmet and golden standard, shaped like iris leaves and coated in gold leaf, made the wearer both identifiable and fearsome. Buckland said that such suits were recycled over the centuries, reusing the robust sections from those inherited from previous generations and remaking more delicate ones such as silk sleeves, among other elements. Even away from the battlefield, a suit of armour was a status symbol. In one such exhibit, the oldest part dates from 1519, while other details were made in the early 19th century. The exhibition will reflect that the samurai enjoyed centuries of peace, with plenty of time to pursue artistic and intellectual interests. The paintings range from a cute cat depicted by a samurai lord’s wife to botanical studies. There is also a firefighting jacket that women wore while serving within Edo Castle. Fires were so common in the wooden city of Edo – present-day Tokyo – that the fires were known as the “flowers of Edo”, and this jacket’s watery motifs of tasselled anchors and waves evoke protection against the flames. High-ranking samurai were responsible for raising the alarm, supervising firefighting and evacuations. The word “samurai” is used increasingly in Japan but only because it is used by foreigners, Buckland said: “It’s difficult to unearth when it started to be used by foreigners. That was a long time ago. “But there are other words in Japanese that mean warrior or member of the military class. Literally, samurai means something like ‘subordinate’. It’s actually got quite a pejorative sense, which is why it was never previously used in Japanese. “In the early times, the word for warrior was ‘musha’ and, in the later times when the samurai were in charge of everything, they were called ‘bushi’.” Buckland observed the Japanese have imported some of the western perceptions “because it’s useful for the tourist industry”. She added: “I went to a hotel last year and was greeted by three virtual check-in receptionists, Godzilla, a geisha – and a samurai warrior.” Samurai is at the British Museum from 3 February to 4 May 2026.

I can’t stand it’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/09/paul-kelly-seventy-milestone-album-interview,"Your new album is called Seventy. You are 70 years old. And I hear you like the number 70. It’s a biblical number. It’s a very pleasing number to me. I like the sound of it. Turning 70 feels like a real marker. I wouldn’t say it’s an achievement, but I must have had my fair share of luck to reach 70. I was pretty reckless and I took risks – so I feel lucky to reach 70. Everything else after this is just extra. I’ve been writing songs about death always being close by since I was pretty young. [laughs] I think Neil Young once said he was writing songs about being old when he was 21. “Old man, take a look at my life …” I think all poets are interested in time and life not being very long. Has Joe [the protagonist of Kelly’s songs How to Make Gravy and To Her Door] stopped talking to you, now he’s dead? No, he won’t shut up. I wrote Rita Wrote a Letter to give Rita her point of view. And it’s all Joe! He’s talking all the way beyond the grave. He’s still talking as the song fades out. I was a little bit worried that some people are going to be upset that I killed off Joe, but it was just fun to do, fun to write, fun to sing. And in the end I haven’t really killed him off at all! You can’t keep him down. Someone has suggested that I can now write a prequel [to How to Make Gravy]. I often get asked, what’s Joe in prison for? And my honest answer is, I don’t know. Oftentimes you write songs and you don’t know the details. He’s in prison. I don’t know why, sorry! What is your most controversial pop culture opinion? I think Imagine by John Lennon is probably one of the worst songs ever written. I can’t stand it. I love having these arguments with Ash Naylor, our guitar player. I love the Beatles and John Lennon, but that song – I didn’t like it from the start and I still don’t like it. Especially when it became really popular. And I could very happily go through the rest of my life without hearing Hotel California again. There’s probably a whole lot more, but I might stop there! One song that I really love that people might be surprised I like is I Want to Know What Love Is by Foreigner. That’s the most beautiful song. You have toured with both Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen. Who was the more fun to tour with? They were both fun. I learned a lot from both of them. I’ve recently done my first ever headline arena tour, and those guys were touchstones for me because they made those big spaces feel intimate in very different ways. Bob was so casual, off the cuff. You get the sense that even his band didn’t know what song was coming next. Leonard, on the other hand, was totally scripted – he said the same thing every night, did the same songs, pretty much – but it didn’t feel rote or showbizzy. It felt more like prayer or ritual. He served the audience, you could feel the love coming at him. Instead of basking in it and making himself big, he made himself a servant. He was like a vaudevillian rabbi, the way he conducted himself. But everyone was hanging on every word. And the same thing with Dylan, because you always know he is going to do something different. His band’s watching him like a hawk, just to make sure they know what song he’s singing. What book, album or film do you always return to and why? The Sound of Music. I’ve gone back to that a few times. It has great tunes, great story, the romance. I love the way that darkness hovers around the edges of that film. I remember when I saw it as a kid, I just thought of it as a fun movie with catchy songs. Then I remember seeing it as an adult and suddenly realising the depth and the darkness around it. It was such a surprise and probably why that film has stayed with me. And I love Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven. He’s an old bounty hunter going back for one last job. Every time he gets on his horse, he’s really struggling. I love that. I go and watch it just for that alone. I get that these days when getting on my push bike! What’s been your most memorable interaction with a fan? The first one that comes to mind was when we played in Amsterdam this year. A guy was at the front of the stage going, “Paul, I’ve got to talk to you!” So I finished the song and said: “Yeah, what’s up?” He said, “I want to propose to my girlfriend on stage.” I was thinking, what could possibly go wrong if I let this happen? I said to him, “Are you sure she’s going to say yes?” By this time the audience is getting involved, so I said, “All right, come on – you better know that she’s going to say yes.” He said, “Yeah, I think so!” So he called her up on stage, but she hadn’t been expecting it so she was way at the back of the room. He called out her name and she wasn’t there – I was thinking, oh my God, this might not be good. I found out later they were quite drunk and they got drunker as the night went on. But she eventually made her way up, he went down on one knee and she said yes. The room went off, they were all happy. And they proceeded to get uproariously drunk and tried to crash the band room later on, but we managed to get out in time. What song would you like played at your funeral? Black and Tan Fantasy by Duke Ellington. It feels like a funeral march. It’s just beautiful orchestration and an unusual song. I first heard it when I was 12 years old – my older sister was going out with a trumpet player and he bought some records around the house. I didn’t know how people could make that kind of music. What’s the best piece of advice you have ever received? In terms of performing, it’s probably from my grandmother, who was an opera singer. She said: “If you’re nervous before a show, just breathe deeply.” It’s the simplest piece of advice. I still use it before shows – think nothing and breathe deeply. What is your least favourite bird and why? The noisy miner, by far. It’s the one we have all around here where we live. They’re bullies. They’re not pretty. They’re bad for the native birds. I’ll be happy to never see another miner again. There’s Indian mynas and noisy miners – they’re all miners to me and I don’t like them. What’s the most chaotic thing that’s happened on stage? Mittagong RSL Club in 1988. It was an unmitigated disaster. When we got there, our PA was in pieces so soundcheck took forever. The support act was a DJ and he was killing it, there were heaps of people on the dancefloor. He started to make snide remarks – “The band’s gonna come on sometime before Christmas”, that sort of thing. We eventually got on and everyone fled to the bar, which seemed about half a mile away. We started playing and it sounded horrible. There was feedback, the monitors sounded muddy. We were really struggling. Finally, one woman came up from the bar and stood in front of our guitar player and started beckoning to him, during the middle of the song. “Maybe one person likes us!” I thought. And when we finished the song, she said, “Listen, I’m leaving now but I just wanted to say before I go that you’re the worst band I’ve ever seen.” [laughs] We’ve had some better shows since then. Seventy by Paul Kelly is out now on EMI"

When the Beat came to play at the Welly club we gave them a demo tape. Then they invited us to tour with them. Later, after they split up, Andy Cox and David Steele were looking for a singer for a new band and they remembered me. Fine Young Cannibals felt right straight away. After The Tube filmed us doing Johnny Come Home, we just took off. Then somebody must have noticed me on telly because suddenly I was getting film offers, and I appeared in Sammy and Rosie Get Laid and Scandal. But in my heart I didn’t really want to pursue acting. It felt like being a session musician – you do your bit, then you’re not really involved. So after the band did the soundtrack for the film Tin Men, we regrouped to do a second album. All sorts of names were mentioned as producers including, I think, Phil Collins. Instead, we ended up doing The Raw and the Cooked in a way people say you should never do an album: in lots of different studios with different producers. We did She Drives Me Crazy with David Z in Prince’s studio in Paisley Park, at which point we changed the title from She’s My Baby. I’d never sung falsetto before, but we were labelmates with Jimmy Somerville so he might have been an influence on the way I sing it. The way I elongate some of the words – “I can’t help mysel-el-elf” and so on – isn’t proper language but rules are there to be broken. She Drives Me Crazy went Top 5 in the UK and was the first of our two US No 1s, but it was bittersweet for me. When it was a hit I was reading Money by Martin Amis and my girlfriend chucked me, just like in the book. On the other hand, we’d always talked about wanting to make music that people would listen to many years later – which is exactly what happened. David Steele, bass, keyboards, drum machine, songwriter We were playing about in the studio when we came up with what became the riff and beat to She Drives Me Crazy, although it was rockier at that point. None of us really liked it and it went into the box of unfinished songs. Good Thing was set to be our “big single” but then London Records wanted us to work with other producers on other tracks. We told them we wouldn’t work with anyone else unless it was Prince. They said “We can’t get Prince!” but did suggest his engineer, David Z, and said we could do it in Prince’s studio, Paisley Park. When we sent David some songs including the beginnings of She Drives Me Crazy, he went: “This is the song! Come over.” David let us use Prince’s room and all his equipment. The Purple Rain guitar was in the corner, his lava lamps were everywhere and the mixing desk had been used by Sly and the Family Stone. You can’t help but feel inspired in that situation, so we tried things such as putting the keyboards through Prince’s wah-wah pedals. Andy played the riff on Prince’s Rickenbacker guitar. David tells a very complicated story of how he got the snare sound by gating it and all sorts, but most of it was just the conga preset on Prince’s drum machine. When Roland came over later from London to do the vocals he didn’t have enough words. I thought of asking Prince to write some for us but that would have turned it into a Prince song. Instead, She Drives Me Crazy was in a notebook I had of song titles. Roland and I finished the lyrics like William Burroughs cut-ups – pillaging a line from another song of ours and such. Roland laid down the falsetto and a normal vocal running parallel, a trick Prince had used on If I Was Your Girlfriend. Prince was around but we were shy and didn’t want to bug him. After She Drives Me Crazy became the first No 1 single recorded at Paisley Park he played it in some of his post-gig jams and we were supposed to meet him properly. We never did, but sometimes it’s good to keep some mystery. • Fine Young Cannibals’ career-spanning hits, rarities and remixes collection FYC40 is released on 5 December. Roland Gift’s single Everybody Knows It’s Christmas is out now"
culture_2025_nov_11_harlem-studio-museum-new-home.txt,culture,2025-11-11,David Smith in New York,‘Harlem has always been evolving’: inside the Studio Museum’s $160m new home,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/11/harlem-studio-museum-new-home,"Call it the second Harlem renaissance. On Manhattan’s 125th Street, where a statue of Adam Clayton Powell Jr strides onwards and upwards, and a sign marks the spot where a freed Nelson Mandela dropped by, there is bustle and buzz. The celebrated Apollo Theater is in the midst of a major renovation. The National Black Theatre is preparing to move into a $80m arts complex spanning a city block. In September the National Urban League opened a $250m building containing its headquarters, affordable housing and retail space with New York’s first civil rights museum to come. And a flag flies high above the pavement of 125th Street. It is the Stars and Stripes, reimagined by the conceptual artist David Hammons in black, red and green, inspired by the Pan-African flag adopted by Marcus Garvey in the 1920s. The installation welcomes visitors to the charcoal, grey and glass facade of the reborn Studio Museum in Harlem. On Saturday the museum – which owns more than 9,000 objects by over 800 artists of African descent – will inaugurate a purpose-built $160m home. Designed by Adjaye Associates with Cooper Robertson as executive architect, the 82,000-sq-ft, seven-floor facility is the first building created expressly for the institution’s mission and almost doubles its exhibition and programme space. Its arrival feels pointed in the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, Smithsonian Institution museums and the way Black history is told all under attack. New York has just elected a mayor who personifies the city’s cultural diversity and Harlem has a gift for making renaissance look like resistance. “This building says to the world: Harlem matters; Black art matters; Black institutions matter,” Raymond J McGuire, chairman of the board of trustees, said at a media preview last week. “It will stand as a lighthouse on 125th Street, a space where creativity and community meet, where young people can see themselves reflected and artists of African descent can continue to shape our history.” The Studio Museum was founded by artists, activists, philanthropists and local residents to “be a place where art happens” and address the systemic exclusion of Black artists from mainstream institutions. It opened in a rented loft above an off-licence on upper Fifth Avenue in 1968, a traumatic year of assassinations, uprisings and social change. McGuire reflected: “This moment feels like what it must have felt like when it all began. The museum was born in a world of flux. The country was divided. People were marching. Artists were demanding to be seen and heard. There was tension but there was also vision. “Out of that vision came the Studio Museum in Harlem, built by artists and activists who believed that art could be a force for justice, for connection, for our humanity itself. Now, more than a half a century later, we find ourselves in another pivotal time, one that echoes the same mix of uncertainty and determination. The issues are different in form but not in substance.” The Studio Museum’s former home was a 1914 bank building, acquired in 1979 and reopened in 1982. While beloved, it was a classic example of “adaptive reuse” – a structure never truly intended to be a museum. Its physical constraints directly hampered the institution’s work. There was no loading dock, forcing priceless artworks to be unloaded on the busy street. There was no big elevator, making the movement of large-scale pieces a daunting logistical challenge. Crucially, public access was restricted, with less than half of the building open to visitors. Despite producing historically significant programmes for decades, the museum was working within a space that could not contain its aspirations. Building a new one was a 14-year project. The new structure, said long-serving director and chief curator Thelma Golden, allows the institution to exist within “a full expression of our ambition and aspirations as a museum”. Golden led a fundraising effort that netted more than $300m from individuals, corporations, foundations and the City of New York. But construction was hampered by the coronavirus pandemic and dragged on for seven years. Further complications arose when a scandal engulfed the museum’s star architect, Sir David Adjaye, prompting his quiet withdrawal from the project and leaving curators and the remaining design team to step up. It is worth the wait. The facility includes galleries, an expansive lobby, flexible programme spaces, a dedicated education workshop, a cafe and shop and a rooftop terrace with panoramic city views. A monumental stair, clad in terrazzo, occupies the central vertical gallery, connecting the lower level to the fourth floor and offering lookout points. The design, including engineered wood and polished concrete, echoes the masonry-framed windows of local apartment buildings and the top-lit interiors of neighbourhood churches. Pascale Sablan, chief executive of Adjaye Associates New York, described the vision for the new building as a “re-imagining of Harlem’s own vernacular architecture”. This is achieved through a “reverse stoop”, which inverts the signature feature of Harlem’s brownstone houses to create a grand, tiered public common for gathering; the “sanctuary”, evoked in the soaring, arched ceilings of a gallery; and the entire building conceived as a “stage” for elevating the work of Black artists. The inaugural programming reflects the museum’s past, present and future with four major exhibitions. One is the first institutional career survey of Tom Lloyd, the pioneering artist whose electronic light sculptures appeared in the museum’s inaugural 1968 exhibition, Electronic Refractions II. There is a rotating exhibition drawn from the museum’s permanent collection. The opening installation features nearly 200 works spanning from the 19th century to the present. Over the course of the year, more than 300 will be displayed. Highlights range from the historic to the contemporary. William T Williams’s 1969 abstract Trane pays homage to John Coltrane, while Kerry James Marshall’s Silence Is Golden (1986) confronts invisibility and Black representation in art. Malvin Gray Johnson’s Harlem Renaissance-era Swing Low, Sweet Chariot (1928-29) and Barkley L Hendricks’s Lawdy Mama (1969) showcase how Black artists blended European modernism with African American cultural narratives. Jean-Michel Basquiat’s Bayou (1984) is a white canvas overlaid with vigorous marks, fragments of collage, schematic diagrams, handwritten notations and bold colour accents. Faith Ringgold’s first story quilt, Echoes of Harlem (1980), captures her neighbourhood in both celebratory and elegiac tones. Upstairs, thematic galleries explore city life, abstraction and spirituality, featuring works from Jacob Lawrence, Jordan Casteel, Lorraine O’Grady, Betye Saar and Rosana Paulino among others. The museum also celebrates its influential artist-in-residence programme with an alumni show including Renée Green, Kehinde Wiley, Mickalene Thomas and Titus Kaphar. The display combines new commissions with historical pieces from Valerie Maynard’s 1973 print 3 A.M. 125th Street to contemporary woven self-portraits by Qualeasha Wood. Among new commissions are Camille Norment’s Untitled (heliotrope), a monumental sonic and sculptural installation on the terrace staircase, composed of handwoven brass wires and tubes and featuring a chorus of voices. Christopher Myers’s Harlem Is a Myth is a wall-mounted, metal-based installation that depicts an intergenerational community of fantastical figures from Harlem’s history, including a centaur Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and winged jazz legends Thelonious Monk and Count Basie. And seven bronze time capsules created by Houston Conwill that contain confidential testaments by seven distinguished Black Americans, originally buried in the museum’s sculpture garden in 1984, are now on display. The capsules will be opened in September 2034, 50 years after their creation. Visitors will find an archival presentation of photographs and ephemera that documents the museum’s history through its exhibitions, events and programmes over nearly six decades. It is a rich history that includes a visit by the monarch of the Ashanti of Ghana in 1984, a performance in the sculpture garden by choreographer Bill T Jones in 1993 and a newspaper report from 1978 that laments a faulty boiler: “If you walk into the Studio Museum in Harlem and find the staff all bundled up in hats and coats, mufflers and gloves, it’s not because they’re ready to walk out. It’s because there is no heat and they are cold.” In an interview in museum offices, Golden, who began her career in 1987 as an intern at the Studio Museum and became director in 2005, said its founders were not only responding to the urgency of their time but consciously looking back to the Harlem Renaissance, seeking to tie the new institution to that profound legacy. “Harlem has always been evolving,” she said. “This is a neighbourhood that has been evolving since it was established right here as upper Manhattan, as a place people began to live. But Harlem has also been a neighbourhood where Black culture has thrived.”"
culture_2025_nov_11_jon-stewart-government-shutdown-deal.txt,culture,2025-11-11,Guardian staff,Jon Stewart on government shutdown deal: ‘A world-class collapse by Democrats’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/11/jon-stewart-government-shutdown-deal,"Late-night hosts unleashed on Senate Democrats for caving on the longest-ever government shutdown with no assurance on healthcare subsidies from Republicans. Jon Stewart Jon Stewart minced no words for congressional Democrats on Monday evening, hours after a coalition broke from the party and voted with Republicans to extend government funding through January with no assurances on the healthcare tax credits at the center of the 41-day stalemate. “By the way, tonight’s show will be brought to you by: I can’t fucking believe it,” Stewart fumed at the top of The Daily Show. “I can’t fucking believe it: for when the ‘I can’t believe it’ Edvard Munch scream emoji doesn’t quite convey how much you cannot fucking believe it.” “They fucking caved on the shutdown, not even a full week removed from the best election night results they’ve had in years,” he continued. “Seven Democratic senators and an independent voted with their Republican counterparts to end the shutdown and reopen the government.” “You had the wind at your back, election victories all over the country, the new Sydney Sweeney movie – box office bupkis,” he added. “Apparently, her new Maga fanbase didn’t show up in droves to see a biopic about a lesbian professional boxer who overcomes domestic violence to live her truth. Who could have seen that coming? Democrats, you sold out the entire shutdown not to get what you wanted but for a promise to not get what you wanted later.” Stewart also raged at the fact that the only assurance Democrats received on the expiring tax credit for healthcare premiums – whose end would effectively cause millions to lose their health insurance – was the promise of a vote on the issue sometime in December. “Surely, someone in the party understands that offering a vote in the Senate without a commitment that it would pass or that the House would even take it up is an empty offer,” he said. Stewart then singled out Democratic senators Tim Kaine, of Virginia, and New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen, two of the eight Democrats who once opposed such a deal with a Republicans. “Look, either all eight senators who voted to capitulate coincidentally are not up for re-election in 2026, or Chuck Schumer worked behind the scenes to give in to the Republicans while still protecting ‘vulnerable Democrats’, including himself,” he quipped. “This is a world-class collapse by Democrats,” he said, comparing it to a spectacular loss by the New York Giants this weekend. “It would be like being up 10 points with three minutes left to go in a game and still finding a way to miraculously lose it for the fourth time in just one month.” “This is what the Democrats have squandered,” he concluded. “They squandered their leverage, sapped their voters’ enthusiasm and snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.” Stephen Colbert “Our long national nightmare is … different,” joked Stephen Colbert on Monday’s Late Show, as the longest-ever government shutdown appeared to be nearing its end after eight Senate Democrats voted with Republicans to fund the government through January without any Affordable Care Act guarantees. “So yes, yes, the shutdown may have been long and painful for millions of Americans, but at least it achieved jack squat,” said Colbert. “No surprise, the vast majority of Democrats do not want this,” he continued. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, none of those eight are up for re-election next year. Two have already announced their retirement. “What a disappointing way to end your career,” said Colbert. “It reminds me of when Journey released their last album: We Stopped Believin’.” Colbert referred to Sheehan, who said of her New Hampshire constituents: “They say, ‘Why can’t you all just work together to address the problems that are facing this country?’ “Because the country is being run by insane people!” Colbert responded, mocking the senator – “‘My constituents want to know why we can’t work with the meth-addled chimps who broke into the cockpit and are now flying the plane. Some of their ideas are reasonable, although admittedly some are bananas.’” Seth Meyers “Democrats had finally backed Trump into a corner. Polls showed that voters were on their side, and then just when it seemed like they finally turned the tables, they buckled,” Seth Meyers lamented on Late Night. “Now, I’m sure you think caving to Republicans without any meaningful concessions constitutes giving up, but that’s because you’re not an expert on politics like Chuck Schumer is,” he joked of the Senate minority leader. “You’re playing checkers, he’s playing chess, and he’s playing it slowly. He’s not playing it to win. He’s playing until his opponent falls asleep. Which, by the way, literally just happened last week,” he added before a photo of Trump asleep on live television during an Oval Office meeting. “Democrats, do you see this? Why are you caving to this guy?” he fumed. “In the span of like five days he got crushed in elections, got booed at a football game, fell asleep at a meeting – and you guys saw that and thought, ‘There’s no way we can beat this guy, he’s at the top of his game.’” Meyers then played a clip of Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who voted with Republicans and justified it to MSNBC: “There never was an endgame if the strategy didn’t work. And now we have one,” he said, with a “guaranteed vote on the ACA. And it may not succeed, I grant that. But a reasonable chance – 10%, 20%, 30% – is a lot better than 0%, which is where we were as of yesterday morning.” “You guys caved for a 10% chance of success?” Meyers marveled. “Also, I hate to break it to you, but it’s still 0%. You and I know this Republican party is not going to work with Democrats. And yet some Democrats are still capable of deluding themselves into thinking that cooperation is possible.” Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel quickly summarized how we got to this point. “Democrats refused to sign on to a bill that would force millions of Americans off their healthcare and make it much more expensive for those who can afford healthcare,” he said. “So Democrats drew a line in the sand. They said: ‘We’re not going over this.’ And today, after 41 days, they pulled out a shovel and a bucket and ate all that sand, and got nothing for it.” “Isn’t that great?” he mocked. “You know what they got? They got a promise from Republicans in the Senate to hold a vote on healthcare sometime in the future. And if there’s one thing we know about Trump and his merry band of sycophants, it’s that their word is as good as gold.” “It’s incredible at his age that Chuck Schumer is still able to bend over so far,” he quipped. “Chuck Schumer is basically every parent who tells their kid ‘No more iPad, that’s it!’ And next thing you know, he’s playing Roblox at the dinner table.” “This was such a big cave by the Democrats, Bruce Wayne offered to buy it,” he joked. “Turns out all Trump had to do was threaten to starve poor people, and he got his way. I’m sure he’ll never do it again, though.”"
culture_2025_nov_12_m-night-shyamalan-old-film-ambitious-abrasive-surprisingly-poignant.txt,culture,2025-11-11,Kevin Bui,"Old is M Night Shyamalan at his best: ambitious, abrasive and surprisingly poignant",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/12/m-night-shyamalan-old-film-ambitious-abrasive-surprisingly-poignant,"In August 2002, Newsweek boldly anointed the stern-faced man pictured on the cover of its splashy summer issue as “The Next Spielberg”. While some might have called this an unfair comparison to one of cinema’s most legendary figures, for a then 31-year-old M Night Shyamalan, it was a childhood dream come true. The Indian-born, Pennsylvanian-raised film-maker had whetted his cinematic appetite on the images of Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and for better or worse, would find himself chasing that same level of stratospheric fame in the early days of his career. Despite the initial acclaim of The Sixth Sense, though, Shyamalan’s reputation and audience goodwill would soon begin to nosedive as his idiosyncratic directing style rubbed against the grander ambitions of his movies. But after a temporary exodus from Hollywood and a retreat to his roots in independent cinema, Shyamalan finally returned to studio film-making in 2021 with the release of Old, a masterful high-concept thriller that rekindled the director’s longtime fascination with family, parenting and the mystifying possibility of the unknown. Unfolding over the course of a single day, Old follows a group of several families and strangers who realise the secluded cove they’ve travelled to for a supposedly idyllic vacation is in fact ageing them by several years in a mere matter of hours, with any attempts made to leave the beach resulting in a dizzying blackout. With an eerie sense of isolation hanging over the proceedings – no doubt a result of the film’s Covid bubble shoot in the Dominican Republic – Shyamalan spends a good chunk of the first act hammering out the story’s key players. Prisca (Vicky Krieps) and Guy Cappa (Gael García Bernal) are in the midst of separating when they decide to take their two young children on what might be their final family holiday, after it’s recently discovered that Prisca has a slow-growing ovarian tumour. They are soon joined at the beach by a host of other peculiar personalities riddled with their own ailments, including schizophrenic surgeon Charles (Rufus Sewell), his hypocalcaemic trophy wife Chrystal (Abbey Lee) and perhaps most amusingly, haemophilic rapper Mid-Sized Sedan (Aaron Pierre). While the picturesque locale provides some momentary reprieve for the Cappa family, it doesn’t take long for hijinks to ensue. Shyamalan wastes no time in exploiting his ensembles’ afflictions, crafting a series of heart-racing sequences that demonstrate how the beach’s supernatural powers are exacerbating their individual maladies. After the accelerated passage of time causes Prisca’s tumour to rapidly grow in one horrifying scene, Charles must lead the group in removing the lump from her body while suffering from his own mental episode that has been aggravated by the intensified ageing. It’s all familiar territory for Shyamalan, who often exposes his characters to inexplicable events in order to shed light on their personal dilemmas. Whether it be the mysterious crop circles in Signs or the superpowered individuals of the Unbreakable-verse, his films brim with difficult truths coated in genre tropes. In Old, watching a child morph into an adult and seeing their body falter in minutes taps into the deeply human illusion of ageing as a slow, creeping process that we ignore over time until it becomes undeniably real. Of course, it wouldn’t be a true Shyamalan movie without one of his signature plot twists, and when the coin finally drops in Old – courtesy of a cheeky cameo from the director himself – the film broadens out to question how far society is willing to go in the name of progress. While there are echoes of The Twilight Zone, Cronenbergian body horror and indeed the sentimental sensibilities of Spielberg throughout its run time, Old retains a voice that’s uniquely Shyamalan’s: earnest, ambitious and unafraid to be abrasive. In a landscape crowded with franchise fare and IP slop, it reaffirms his role as a film-maker who swings big – and just like his childhood idol, one who is able to withstand the tides of change. Old is available to rent in Australia, the UK and the US. For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia, click here"

Scene 1. A classroom in a secondary school in Peterborough. It is a dreary, wet afternoon. Pupils file into the room, take their seats and face the front. These year 10 English students at Ormiston Bushfield academy are taking part in a workshop about Macbeth, part of a new curriculum devised by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) to bring the Bard’s works to life in the UK’s slightly stuffy classrooms. The pupils are quiet. They slump in their seats. Then a rehearsal-style game of “pass the click [of fingers]” warms them up, and a few minutes later they are up on their feet, paired up and performing some of Shakespeare’s best-known lines with gusto. The focus of this session is on Act 1, scene 7, a pivotal moment in Shakespeare’s famous tragedy where Macbeth is having doubts but is persuaded to kill King Duncan by his wife, Lady Macbeth, who taunts and goads him into action. “Art thou afeard … ?” rings out across the desks. “I have given suck,” someone else yells out, without so much as a giggle, as “plucked my nipple” and “boneless gums” (some of Lady Macbeth’s many memorable lines) echo through the classroom. Paul Ainsworth, the RSC’s young theatre makers developer, who is running the session, is delighted. “Generally we are all terrified of Shakespeare,” he says. “But as soon as we start working actively on the text, exploring it as a play rather than a piece of literature, it opens it up to young people.” The RSC Shakespeare curriculum, which is funded by the Foyle Foundation, launches on Wednesday. It is an online platform for teachers and pupils which uses the RSC’s rehearsal-based teaching approaches – honed in classrooms across the world – to transform the study of Shakespeare in schools. It provides access to more than 2,000 resources including video extracts from RSC rehearsals and past productions, as well as activity-packed lesson plans, and is free to all state schools in the UK. Instead of pupils sitting at their desks glumly taking it in turns to read the play out loud, the RSC curriculum treats Shakespeare’s works as living, breathing texts for performance. Launching first with Macbeth this year, Romeo and Juliet will follow in early 2026, with two more plays each academic year. “The RSC can’t get actors into every school in the country,” says Adjoa Andoh, who plays Lady Danbury in Bridgerton and is a leading light in the RSC. “So this is a way of getting Shakespeare – a living, breathing thing – into schools to excite kids.” The RSC approach is working well for 15-year-old Charlie, who generally prefers rap to Shakespeare. “I’m not usually a performer,” he says. “But it was a nice break, doing something different.” Kieran, 14, is also enthusiastic. “I really enjoyed it. I think some people don’t like Shakespeare because they don’t understand immediately what a lot of it means, but if you listen to it a little bit, even if you don’t fully understand it, you can grasp what’s going on.” David Tennant, best known as Dr Who but a Shakespeare veteran whose recent performance as Macbeth garnered a five-star review in the Guardian, is enthusiastic about the new curriculum. “Many young people’s first experience of Shakespeare is in a classroom. “The lucky ones might have a brilliant teacher who can bring it to life, but many find themselves inexplicably mouthing words that make little sense to you at the age of 14. Shakespeare should be experienced, engaged with and performed, not just read from a page.” Judi Dench, who has played most of Shakespeare’s major female roles in and told the Guardian in 2023, “All I ever wanted to do was play Shakespeare, nothing else”, believes his plays are timeless and can still resonate with young people today. Dench said: “In the rehearsal room, we don’t have all the answers on day one, instead we explore the play and its language, peeling back its layers and playing with different interpretations to find a way of telling the story for today. “The Shakespeare curriculum will bring the spirit of collaboration, inquiry and discovery from the rehearsal room into classrooms up and down the country, inspiring and engaging young minds”."

Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke about the vote to end the federal government shutdown which has seen some Democrats choosing to cave to Republican demands without restoring the healthcare subsidies which were initially threatened. Chuck Schumer told his party he would give the deal neither a blessing nor a curse and would give no steer on how to vote. Colbert joked that this was “bold leadership” and commented on Schumer’s “failure” in the situation. The shutdown has caused major chaos at airports as air traffic controllers were being unpaid for so long that many of them stopped coming to work. On social media, Trump attacked them, saying they would be “substantially docked” and he would hold “a negative mark” at least in his mind against their record. “A negative mark in that mind?” Colbert quipped. “You know what, I’ll take my chances.” He also wrote that he wanted them to be “quickly replaced by true patriots” to which Colbert responded: “Maybe I’m alone, but I don’t care if the guy landing my plane is a true patriot.” He called Trump “an old nepo-billionaire who simply does not understand how hard it is for regular people to survive these days”. This week also saw that regular people are not happy with the state of living, with a consumer satisfaction survey falling to 52.3%, the worst ever score dating back to 1951. “Consumers have not felt this bad since we fed our babies cigarettes,” he said. This week also saw Trump tout a 50-year mortgage in a supposed bid to help those struggling to afford home ownership, yet a study showed that interest would almost double from the standard 30-year mortgage. Colbert called it “a big dumb policy that fixes nothing”. He also warned that a new 107% tariff could lead to Italian pasta disappearing from shelves. “We are officially in a pasta-mergency,” he said. Colbert joked that Trump’s destruction of the White House’s East Wing was “to build a massive compensation for his weird tiny penis” before moving on to his latest addition: labelling the Oval Office. The host claimed that the font being used was called “luxury assisted living” before showing that when you Google it, the same font that comes up. Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers started by talking about the House speaker, Mike Johnson, ordering Congress to return to Capitol Hill for the vote. “I’m sure they would if only the flights weren’t all grounded,” he said. This week also saw Trump write “Less crime more Trump” on social media. “Less crime sounds great but how could there be more Trump?” Meyers asked, before adding: “We’re maxed out on Trump.” Last week saw Joe Biden speak for 30 minutes at a fundraising dinner. Meyers expressed surprise that it was so short, joking that “he usually speaks that long to the valet”. Transportation secretary and former Real World contestant Sean Duffy warned Americans that ongoing issues over flights might mean that many will miss celebrating the holidays with their families. “Oh no, I was so excited to discuss that Zohran win with my uncle,” Meyers said."
culture_2025_nov_13_stephen-colbert-on-trump-and-epstein.txt,culture,2025-11-13,Guardian staff,Colbert on Trump and Epstein: ‘They were best pals and underage girls was Epstein’s whole thing’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/13/stephen-colbert-on-trump-and-epstein,"Late-night hosts covered this week’s latest bombshell Epstein and Trump revelations and spoke about the president’s latest interview with Laura Ingraham. Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke about the government shutdown likely coming to an end after “an historic impasse” (the shutdown later did end) and Democrat Adelita Grijalva being sworn in as a member of Congress, seven weeks after she won a special House election in Arizona. Colbert said she has been “reborn from the ashes” and will be the 218th and final signature needed to force a vote to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. He joked that on her first day she was shown around and told “down there is the room where you’re going to topple the pervert cabal”. This week saw some new emails from Epstein released which suggest Trump knew of his conduct. “What a shocking, shocking revelation,” Colbert deadpanned. He joked that it was “like that moment in The Sixth Sense when Bruce Willis appears on screen and you’re like I get it, he’s the guy on the poster”. Colbert said it was inevitable that Trump was aware, adding: “They were best pals and underage girls was Epstein’s whole thing.” It was “not the only damning email”, with one sent around Trump’s 2015 run showing Epstein suggest possible ways to answer questions about their friendship. Colbert said it’s “never a good sign when Jeffrey Epstein is trying to help you draft a response”, comparing him to a “perverted Clippy”. He joked that when “reached for comment, Donald Trump bulldozed the West Wing”. Republicans claim Democrats are cherrypicking the emails, so they released 20,000 additional documents but that “doesn’t prove anything”. He went on to talk about another odd item this week. “I don’t know if we’ll ever forget the insanity of the Trump presidency, and Trump wants to make sure that we can’t possibly,” he said. This week saw the reveal of a one-dollar coin depicting Trump to celebrate the 250th birthday of the US. “Pick someone who was there when it was founded, like Joe Biden,” Colbert joked. He also spoke about Trump’s “big stupid ballroom” and how he has been doing “extreme home makeovers all over the White House”. Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also spoke about how Trump is “turning the White House into a pharaoh’s tomb” with the “kind of decor you see in a restaurant where they have a fish tank in the waiting area”. He joked that it’s “probably the next thing Trump’s gonna add to the Oval Office”. In an awkward new interview with Fox News pundit Laura Ingraham, “Trump is talking out of his ass” when stumbling over the specifics of the renovation, Meyers said. “This is what Trump was focused on while his government was shut down,” Meyers said. The president was “wandering around the White House like a property only child”, the host joked in reference to the Property Brothers TV show. He then moved on to Epstein and spoke about the emails, which reporters say have raised new questions about their friendship. “They raise new questions?” he said. “To me it sounds like they answer old questions.”"
culture_2025_nov_14_seth-meyers-trump-late-night-recap.txt,culture,2025-11-14,Guardian staff,Seth Meyers on Trump: ‘The most unpopular president of all time’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/14/seth-meyers-trump-late-night-recap,"Seth Meyers spoke about rising tensions within the Republican party with Donald Trump losing support from his base over the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The Late Night host spoke about yesterday’s dramatic meeting in the situation room to discuss Epstein, an ongoing crisis that has seen the president becoming “wildly unpopular”. Meyers said that Trump is “by all the accounts the most unpopular president of all time” and up until this point has only been “able to hang on to power because he has a tight grip on the Republican party no matter what he did or how bad things got”. But a new poll shows that only 33% of American adults approve of how the president is managing the government, a figure that’s down from March with the fall driven by Republicans or independents. Meyers called this “a meaningful and real development” and “it’s not coming out of thin air” with Trump “pissing off Maga” in multiple ways. In a recent interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, the president defended the importance of H-1B visas, saying that workers need to come from outside the US as there’s not enough people with “certain talents”. Meyers joked that Trump is now saying “you can’t expect me to make America again with only Americans”. His comments were criticised as being overly negative about US workers. “You’re the president – you’re supposed to talk us up,” Meyers said. “You’re the mascot for America.” Trump took aim at people queueing for unemployment, which led Meyers to joke: “Why are you shitting on people in the unemployment line? If you didn’t have a rich dad, that’s where you would be.” Meyers said that Trump “should be a cheerleader for America” before playing a montage of him saying that’s exactly what he is in the past. His base is also annoyed with the Epstein scandal, a “far-reaching conspiracy that Maga spent years obsessing over” and one that has “caused a panic in Trump world”. Yesterday saw the president “flustered” in front of press with him refusing to take questions from reporters while claiming that the country was doing well and that it was a great day. Meyers said he has “never seen anyone so sad while saying the words ‘it’s a great day’”. He said Trump “looks like a kid that asked for an Xbox for Christmas but got a jigsaw puzzle instead”. He spoke about the “emergency meetings over this Epstein bombshell” that involved a string of high-ranking names as well as the controversial Colorado representative Lauren Boebert, who was one of the few Republicans to vote for the release of the Epstein files. “You know you’re in the shit when you’ve got to count on Lauren Boebert to bail you out,” he joked, referring to her as a “crazy” person. He added: “It’s taken 10 years but we’re finally seeing a sizable portion of the Maga base grow frustrated with Trump both on policy and on the Epstein scandal. It’s still not a majority, but a growing number of Republicans are losing patience with Trump.”"
culture_2025_nov_14_the-louvre-heist-seems-straight-out-of-a-screenplay-no-wonder-on-screen-capers-have-us-gripped.txt,culture,2025-11-14,Gabrielle Schwarz,The Guide #217: The Louvre heist seems straight out of a screenplay – no wonder on-screen capers have us gripped,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/14/the-louvre-heist-seems-straight-out-of-a-screenplay-no-wonder-on-screen-capers-have-us-gripped,"It was like something out of a movie. On the morning of 19 October, news broke of a heist at the Louvre in Paris: four thieves, disguised as construction workers, had made off with eight “priceless” pieces of French crown jewels from the 19th century. They also took a crown that once belonged to Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, but for some reason dropped it outside the museum. The haul has since been valued by a prosecutor at around €88m. The details of the case are astonishing, from the robbery itself – the thieves arrived in broad daylight, using a truck with a mechanical ladder to access the targeted gallery’s window, which they cut through with power tools – to subsequent revelations about the museum’s security measures. Reportedly, the password for its CCTV servers was “Louvre”, the source of much mirth since. Of course, it’s not really a funny situation. The jewels remain unrecovered, and may have already been broken up for sale (at a fraction of their original value): irreplaceable pieces of cultural heritage possibly lost for ever. Nevertheless, as a genre of story, the museum heist retains an undeniable appeal. It’s audacious, glamorous, sexy and, as far as crimes go, mostly unbloody. No wonder the theft of art or jewels from under the noses of security guards is a popular plotline on-screen – more popular than going to museums and looking at the art itself, perhaps. It is usually played for laughs, as a sub-category of the comedy crime caper. Exemplary in this regard is the 1966 film How to Steal a Million, starring Audrey Hepburn and Peter O’Toole as architects of the heist. The classically convoluted narrative involves a plan to steal back a forged sculpture attributed to the Italian artist Benvenuto Cellini, which has been loaned for an exhibition at the fictional Musée Kléber-Lafayette in Paris, before insurers can work out that it is a fake. Moral qualms about the crime are side-stepped by various means, including the sculpture’s status as a forgery – and the charisma of its conniving yet ultimately sympathetic stars. This is, at heart, a romantic comedy. It is also gorgeous to look at. Hepburn’s outfits are supplied by Givenchy, her jewels by Cartier. For the many artworks that appear on-screen, production designer Alexandre Trauner apparently paid the best forgers in Paris a total of $100,000 to create “masterpieces” inspired by real artists. Other cinematic museum heists range from silly to sillier. In Topkapi (1964), an international gang rope in a small-time conman, played by Peter Ustinov, as their fall guy in the theft of an emerald-encrusted Ottoman dagger from Topkapı Palace in Istanbul. In The Hot Rock (1972), Robert Redford has to repeatedly steal the same gem – a diamond in the Brooklyn Museum called the Sahara Stone – because things keep going wrong. In the 2007 reboot of St Trinian’s, schoolgirls target Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring from the National Gallery in London to help settle their school’s debts. In reality, one of the world’s most recognisable paintings would – like most stolen art – be impossible to sell or leverage. But who cares, it’s just a movie! (I’ve left out small-screen museum heists here, but they are a mainstay of lighthearted police procedurals; my favourite is White Collar, with Matt Bomer as a con artist recruited by the FBI to crack the cases.) It’s interesting, then, to see a very different approach to the genre in a recent release: The Mastermind (2025), featuring Josh O’Connor as, to quote the headline of Peter Bradshaw’s review in the Guardian, the “world’s worst art thief”, who plans the burglary of four paintings by the American artist Arthur Dove from a fictional museum in 1970s Massachusetts. The film is written and directed by Kelly Reichardt, who is associated with the art-house genre of slow cinema – long takes, deliberate pace, minimal plot, certainly no high-octane thrills. Adopting this style for a heist movie is a strange choice, which may dissatisfy some, but which I appreciated for its commitment to realism. Besides, we still get some good laughs. In one lengthy scene, shot in near-total darkness, we watch O’Connor’s character struggle to transport the paintings up a ladder, to be hidden under some hay in a farmyard barn. There’s a pig grunting in the background. Then the thief falls to the ground, his trousers covered in mud and shit. It’s a great moment of bathos that punctures the idea of crime as in any way glamorous.

culture_2025_nov_15_my-cultural-awakening-billy-connolly.txt,culture,2025-11-20,Melanie Brehaut; as told to Emma Loffhagen,My cultural awakening: I moved across the world after watching a Billy Connolly documentary,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/15/my-cultural-awakening-billy-connolly,"I was 23 and thought I had found my path in life. I’d always wanted to work with animals, and I had just landed a job as a vet nurse in Melbourne. I was still learning the ropes, but I imagined I would stay there for years, building a life around the work. Then, five months in, the vet called me into his office and told me it wasn’t working out. “It’s not you,” he said, “I just really hate training people.” His previous nurse had been with him for decades; she knew his every move. I didn’t. And just like that, I was out of a job. I drove home crying, feeling utterly adrift. I wasn’t sure whether to try again at another vet clinic or rip up the plan entirely and do something else. After spending a few days floating around aimlessly, trying to recalibrate my life, I turned on the TV, needing something to take my mind off things. And there he was: Billy Connolly, striding across a windswept Scottish landscape in his World Tour of Scotland documentary. I had always liked Billy: I’d watched plenty of his standup shows on TV, laughing at his stories about growing up in Glasgow. But this was different. The programme, which had come out a few years previously, in 1994, was a love letter to Scotland, full of history, humour and stunning scenery. I had never studied British or Irish history at school, so everything he was talking about – the castles, the battles, the wild coastlines – was brand new to me. I found myself completely transfixed. It wasn’t one joke or moment that got me, it was the combination of it all: his warmth, his irreverent humour and the rugged beauty of the country. I thought: I have to go there. Six months later I had saved enough money to book a trip. I flew into Edinburgh, and as soon as I stepped outside the airport I felt a jolt of recognition, as though something had clicked into place. It was like I had grown up in the wrong country. I spent the first week on a coach tour of the Highlands, then hired a car and drove around the south. I got hopelessly lost more than once – this was pre-GPS – but I loved every moment. When I returned to Melbourne, I knew I hadn’t had my fill. Two years later I applied for a UK work visa, signed up for a live-in pub job in London, and flew back across the world. The plan was to stay in London for a few months, then head up to Scotland to work and explore. Things didn’t go exactly to plan. A bar job in Scotland fell through, and I ended up following a friend to Belfast on a whim. I thought I’d stay a couple of months. I’ve now been here for 26 years. There was something about Belfast that drew me in. It was a smaller, more approachable place to build a life, and I felt people were willing to give me a chance in a way I hadn’t experienced before. I worked in a bar, and it was there that I met my future husband, who was also working there at the time. We got engaged a year later, and eventually fought a long, hard battle with the Home Office to get permanent residency, which I finally received in 2018. My parents were supportive of my decision to come here, although I think they assumed I’d be back after two years. I sometimes wonder how different my life would be if I hadn’t turned on the TV that day; if I’d just stayed home feeling sorry for myself instead of being inspired by a mouthy Glaswegian wandering around Scotland. Thanks to that chance moment 28 years ago, I have a life I love: a home, cat, a husband, and a deep connection to the UK. Without meaning to be, it was a real sliding doors moment, and a fork in the road. And I’m so glad I chose this path."

It turns out that after being sold and leaving the UK, the astrolabe passed through private collections in Australia and the US, its true identity forgotten along the way, before ending up in a museum on the Florida Keys. “It’s been on quite a journey,” said Xavier Duffy, the curator of the Isles of Scilly Museum. “We’re thrilled to have it back on Scilly and in the care of the museum. We can’t wait to share its story with visitors.” The astrolabe, made of a type of bronze, was found in about 1990 in the wreck of a Spanish ship that sank off Pednathise Head, part of Scilly’s uninhabited Western Rocks. The Scilly archipelago, 30 miles off the British mainland, is infamous for shipwrecks. It is not known what the unnamed ship was doing there but it is thought to have been lost at about the time of the Spanish Armada’s attempt to overthrow Elizabeth I in 1588. The Pednathise Head astrolabe was not complete but relatively few are known to survive worldwide and the intrigue around them helps make them valuable artefacts. Philip Pullman saw examples at the History of Science Museum in Oxford and, in the His Dark Materials series, based the look of the mystical truth-telling device the alethiometer on the astrolabe. The Scilly astrolabe was sold and then vanished. It has now been established that at some point it was misidentified as another astrolabe found on a ship called the Nassau, a Dutch vessel that sank off Malaysia in 1606. It is known to have been in the collection of a man from South Australia but was seized by the state when he was convicted of serious crimes. The astrolabe was subsequently mentioned in a chat group by an Australian antiques dealer who said he had paid “peanuts” for it and it was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Curiously, it then found its way into the collection of a car dealer in New Jersey who donated it to the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum in the Florida Keys. A US expert on astrolabes, James Jobling, realised it was the Scilly astrolabe. There were two more stops for it – his laboratory in Texas and the National Maritime Museum in Falmouth, Cornwall – before it arrived back in Scilly. It will take pride of place as the centrepiece of a navigation case at the islands’ revamped museum on the most populous island, St Mary’s, next year. Lydia Bassett, the director of Scilly Arts &amp; Heritage, said: “It’s great timing for us because our museum will open next autumn. “The maritime gallery will tell the story of the many shipwrecks on Scilly. We’re so pleased to have the astrolabe back.”"

Nicholls, who described the book as “a classic piece of comic writing and an incredible piece of ventriloquism on Sue Townsend’s part”, will adapt the book that produced one of the best-known literary creations of the 1980s. Known for Mole’s comically dramatic assessments of his life in a Midlands cul-de-sac – “I feel like a character in a Russian novel half the time” – the book sold 20m copies worldwide and was translated into 30 languages. The BBC said: “With only a multi-coloured ballpoint pen as his guide, Adrian worries about his spots, his parents’ divorce, the torment of first love and the fact he’s never seen a female nipple.” None of the cast has been revealed, and producers say “a nationwide … search is currently underway to find Adrian”. Gian Sammarco starred in the Thames TV’s The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole in 1985, with Julie Walters playing Mole’s mother, Pauline. The book was also adapted as a musical and a play, and a second TV series of based on Townsend’s follow-up novel, The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole, was released in 1987. Big Talk Studios, the production company behind Ludwig and The Outlaws, will produce the show for the BBC, while Nicholls will be joined in the writing room by Moran and her sister Caroline, Big Boy’s Jack Rooke, and Dillon Mapletoft and Oliver Taylor, the team behind Everyone Else Burns. Despite Mole first appearing four decades ago, the character’s influence continues to be felt. Townsend, who died in 2014, said the character “wouldn’t be using Twitter to memorialise his life” in the age of social media because “his thoughts and diary were very much private”. The BBC’s director of drama, Lindsay Salt, said: “The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole is one of those rare, seminal stories that has captivated generation after generation. “David Nicholls has brilliantly distilled the wit, warmth and quiet poignancy of Sue Townsend’s iconic novel, reminding us why Adrian’s voice remains as sharply relevant today as it was in the 1980s. “Times may have changed, but the anxieties, ambitions and wonderfully awkward truths at the heart of Adrian’s world are utterly timeless.”"

A red shard on a ridge, it looks first like a warning sign, and then something more comforting: a shelter pitched into the wind. The structure stands on a high ridge in the municipality of Valbondione, along the Alta Via delle Orobie, exposed to avalanches and sudden weather shifts. I saw it from above, after taking off from the Rifugio Fratelli Longo, near the village of Carona – a small mountain municipality a little over an hour’s drive from GAMeC, Bergamo’s Galleria d’Arte Moderna e Contemporanea – the closest access point I was given for the site visit. The Frattini Bivouac is not staffed, ticketed or mediated. Anyone can enter it, but only after a six-to-eight-hour ascent on foot across scree, moss and snowfields. When I visited, I only saw it from the helicopter for the press preview; in every other circumstance, the only route is the long climb. Perhaps surprisingly, there is also no art inside this museum. The inside is austere: nine sleeping platforms, a wooden bench, a rectangular skylight framing a strip of sky that becomes the only artwork on view. There are no vitrines, labels or interpretative devices. Instead, there is temperature, silence, altitude. Sound travels strangely here: breath, boots, rain on fabric. The museum, usually devoted to protecting objects from the elements, has instead exposed itself to them. Designed by Turin-based Studio EX with the Italian Alpine Club (CAI), the bivouac opened in this autumn as the final chapter of Thinking Like a Mountain: an expression coined by the American ecologist Aldo Leopold, and the title of the museum’s two-year experiment in relocating culture from the gallery to the ecosystem. According to GAMeC director Lorenzo Giusti, the premise is that curating can be a form of geological thinking: slow, durational, attuned to forces larger than the human. Over two years, the project has unfolded across the valleys and pre-alpine villages of Bergamo: performances in former factories, installations in biodiversity oases, sculptures in mining districts. Each commission appeared for a season or a day, often reachable only on foot, involving local communities as co-actors rather than audience. The Frattini Bivouac is the project’s most distilled iteration: the point where the museum leaves the museum entirely. You could also say it’s the point where the project’s claims are most robustly tested by reality. The bivouac replaces a 1970s steel refuge that had become structurally dangerous and contaminated with asbestos. That previous shelter, though hazardous for humans, had become part of the mountain’s texture: local ibex used its metal siding to scratch their horns, leaving bright arcs on the surface. The new structure had to be safe for people, ecologically lighter, and climate resilient – yet there is no guarantee the surrounding wildlife will welcome it. Even the architects admit they have little certainty about how the experimental materials (technical fabric, cork, lightweight composite frame) will respond to animal contact over time. Altitude tests ideas as quickly as it corrodes metal. Studio EX designed the new refuge to weigh just over two tonnes. It was airlifted to the ridge in four rotations, each drop a calculation of balance and wind. The building is a paradox in all the ways its designers intended: permanent yet reversible, robust yet flexible, insulated yet breathable. Its red shell is technical fabric stretched like skin; its interior is lined with cork that expands and contracts with mountain temperatures. Solar panels on the roof power basic lighting and emergency outlets – no heating, no running water, no phone line: enough to keep a stranded hiker alive, but far from comfortable. The building is a shelter first, an artwork only by consequence. At this altitude, however, accessibility is never neutral. A high-mountain shelter is not a luxury pod – there are no helicopter tours, no exclusive stays – but it is still reachable only to a small portion of the public: alpinists, seasoned hikers, and the rare journalist flown in for a preview. The museum’s mission, historically tied to public access, is stretched thin here. If only a few hundred visitors can physically reach a commission, can it still be said to serve the public? Or is this an inevitable tension of ecological art – that the closer a work gets to the land, the fewer people can stand before it? There is also the question of overtourism. The Alps are experiencing a surge of recreational pressure, driven in part by gorpcore culture. The architects insist their bivouac is a counterpoint to that aesthetic – lightweight, reversible, modest. But even as a refusal of the Instagram-friendly refuge trend, it risks becoming its mirror image: a gorpcore in reverse, where instead of peak-performance gear, it is peak-performance culture that claims the ridge. And then there is the matter of symbolism. A museum ascending to 2,300m (7,546ft) inevitably reads like a form of institutional assertion: the tiny red point on the summit, the planted flag. The team is acutely aware of this and has repeatedly stressed its intentions – care, coexistence, humility. But architectural gestures, especially at altitude, can carry meanings their authors never intended. The bivouac can be read simultaneously as an act of love and an act of hubris: a structure that wants to merge with the mountain while also marking it. Still, there is something quietly radical about the Frattini Bivouac’s proposal. It asks whether culture can withstand discomfort, whether a museum can inhabit a site where climate, not concept, determines the terms of survival. It reframes the curator not as someone who selects but someone who adapts – to weather, to terrain, to the limits of the human body. Watching the ridge after the helicopter lifted away, I was struck by how small the building looked. Whatever else it may be, it is also a reminder that nothing at altitude stays fixed for long: not buildings, not intentions, not even the ground beneath them. • The Frattini Bivouac is located at 46°02’27.60”N 9°55’14.90”E and open throughout the year. Visitors are advised to check weather and trail conditions with the Italian Alpine Club"

It’s a science fiction story, more or less, but also indicative of the sort of writer Rushdie would become: garrulous, playful, energetic. The tale of an immortal Indian who travels to a mysterious island, it’s messy but charming, and the sense of writing as performance is already here. (Rushdie’s first choice of career was acting, and he honed his skill in snappy lines when working in an advertising agency.) Not a great book, but one that shows a great writer finding his voice, and a fascinating beginning to a stellar career. 9 Quichotte (2019) Rushdie’s love for pop culture – he was inspired to write his first story, aged nine, after watching The Wizard of Oz – was never more evident than in this rompy rewrite of Don Quixote that references Back to the Future, Disney’s Pinocchio, Beavis and Butt-Head, Starsky &amp; Hutch and more. The eponymous character is driven mad by watching too much TV – but his story is itself being written by a washed-up spy novelist. In its layers within layers it’s as hyperactive as Grimus, but a bit more controlled. And even if Rushdie in this book is half-charming raconteur, half pub-bore, the energy will keep you bouncing merrily along. 8 The Moor’s Last Sigh (1995) Rushdie’s first novel for adults after The Satanic Verses prompted the supreme leader of Iran to issue a fatwa against him in 1989 was a dam bursting open to release all the pent-up ideas, characters and jokes of the previous six years. It’s the story of “Moor” Zogoiby, the ousted heir to a crooked spice dynasty and the youngest of four siblings: “Ina, Minnie, Mynah, Moor”. You can infer references to Rushdie’s ordeal (“Here I stand. Couldn’t’ve done it differently”), but mostly this is supreme, nutritious entertainment. It was shortlisted for the Booker prize and, because of Rushdie’s security needs, this meant – according to that year’s winner, Pat Barker – “lots of men with bulging armpits standing round”. 7 Shame (1983) Coming soon after his great epic Midnight’s Children, Shame is overshadowed but one of Rushdie’s best. It’s shorter, tighter and somewhat darker than its predecessor. Set in “not quite Pakistan”, it delivers a satire of the country that is both over the top and deadly serious. Here, a diet of “honour” above all else leads to brutal killings, – “Shame is like everything else: live with it long enough and it becomes part of the furniture” – but there is typically glorious comedy too. Shame won a major prize in Iran for best translated novel of the year – so Rushdie had no inkling of the way the country’s leadership would respond to his next novel: The Satanic Verses. 6 Knife (2024) Rushdie’s second memoir is about his attempted murder on stage in New York in 2022. “So it’s you,” he recalls thinking as a man in black rushed towards him. “Here you are.” Knife offers a sometimes gruelling account of his recovery – his wife wouldn’t let him look in the mirror, in case realising how serious his injuries were sapped his spirit – but it’s also peppered with Rushdie’s usual humour. Losing four stone, he “no longer had to worry about being overweight”. It also displays a rare softness, with beautiful praise for his wife, his late friend Martin Amis and others. It’s a book where “hatred is answered, and finally overcome, by love”. 5 Haroun and the Sea of Stories (1990) Rushdie was ready to give up writing after The Satanic Verses, but “the thing that saved me as a writer was having promised my son a book”. Haroun, then, is a story for children and adults that distils Rushdie’s greatest qualities – storytelling, comedy, imagination – into a fable about a storyteller doomed to silence. It’s a good entry point for those in what Rushdie calls his “page 15 club of readers” – people who can’t get through his sometimes dense prose. And it’s not hard to see his own experiences in the book: “Stories are fun,” says hero Haroun; “Stories make trouble,” insists the despotic dictator Khattam-Shud. With a joyous blend of wordplay, fantasy and “P2C2Es” (Processes too Complicated to Explain), Haroun is Rushdie’s lightest, brightest achievement. 4 Shalimar the Clown (2005) Rushdie’s best novel of the 21st century is about the murder of an American ambassador to India by a Kashmiri named Shalimar the Clown. It’s a book about “the crimes of the 14th century [being] avenged in the 20th” and the horrors of political violence: “It all made the new, senseless kind of sense.” Addressing Rushdie’s perennial theme of worlds in collision, it also becomes a page-turning thriller and a powerfully moving tragedy. Even Rushdie was overwhelmed, occasionally crying as he wrote. “What am I doing?” he asked himself. “This is somebody I’ve made up.” That, of course, is the power of great writing. 3 Joseph Anton (2012) Rushdie’s memoir of his time under the Ayatollah’s death threat gives a powerful report on the anguish he and his family felt. More surprisingly, it is a comic masterpiece. Rushdie, writing in the third person, drops names shamelessly, whether biting back at Roald Dahl, who had criticised Rushdie during the fatwa affair (Dahl was “a long, unpleasant man with huge strangler’s hands”); or revealing how not to tell Bernardo Bertolucci you hate his new film (“he put his hand on his heart and said, ‘Bernardo … I can’t talk about it’”); or sharing perhaps the greatest suffering during his time undercover: having Harold Pinter fax him his terrible poems. 2 The Satanic Verses (1988) The extra-literary reaction to this book has blotted out its brilliance as a novel. In helter-skelter style, The Satanic Verses opens with two actors, Gibreel and Saladin, falling through the air over England after their plane is blown up by Sikh terrorists. “What an entrance, yaar. I swear: splat.” But they survive, each undergoing a metamorphosis – Gibreel becomes an angel, Saladin grows devil’s horns – and this is just the first act of their troubles. Especially evergreen is the book’s take on the immigrant experience in Britain, and how the demonisation of others leads in only one direction. It is a model for the freedom for literature to say whatever it wants to, as loud as it can. 1 Midnight’s Children (1981) After Grimus took a “critical beating”, Rushdie knew he had to pull out all the stops with his second novel. His peers – Amis, Ian McEwan – were outpacing him. He created the story of Saleem Sinai, born on the moment of Indian independence from British rule, which makes a virtue of its eclectic style drawing on multiple cultures. It creates a flood of language teeming “fastfast” down the page and pulling the reader helplessly along. Midnight’s Children won not only the Booker prize in 1981 but also the Booker of Bookers in 1993, and the Best of the Booker in 2008. It is not only an incredible achievement on its own terms: it opened a door to the next generation of writers. It was, in the words of Anita Desai, “the voice of a new age”. It is a book with room for everything and everyone. To browse all titles by Salman Rushdie, visit the guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply."

We had to prove ourselves fast. Tango’s brief was basically to get talked about. They told us: “We want Coca-Cola to be afraid of this little British brand.” The campaign was based around the hit of real fruit. We decided to escalate that concept, making the hit a physical thing. Most ads were cause and effect – consume the product and something pleasant happens. We flipped that, so something unpleasant happens in a farcical way. It was almost anti-advertising. I loved Charlie Chaplin kicking people up the bum, then running off. A boot up the backside was deemed too aggressive but we figured we’d get away with a Morecambe and Wise-style slap. We shot tests with a camcorder but the slap didn’t look big enough. We ended up putting our arms straight out to the sides, pause, then “whack!”. At first, it was just a big guy. Al said: “Let’s make him orange, so he’s more a manifestation of the drink.” He became this shirtless orange genie. We auditioned loads of actors. Peter Geeves, who got the job, was a proper thespian. He had this funny way of running with his tummy thrust forward and head back, which clinched it. When the ad got pulled by the agency, we got him to redo it with a kiss instead of a slap and Peter told us: “I can’t get parts any more. Everybody just sees me as this fat orange bloke.” Gil Scott-Heron did the closing voiceover. I was terrified – asking one of my heroes to say, “You know when you’ve been Tango’d” at the end of our silly ad. But Gil was giggling away, saying, “You English guys are crazy!” After filming, we were bouncing around like excited toddlers. Whenever we showed the ad to people, it got a reaction of: “What the hell was that?” We knew it was going to be either loved or hated and, if the latter, we’d probably be back on the dole. An industry figure called it “oik advertising”. We were working-class kids trying to make a noise. I knew it was a winner when I fell asleep on the tube one night and woke up to hear these guys mimicking the ad. I wanted to shout: “I did that!” I was in a cinema when it came on and the whole audience roared with laughter. It was the best feeling. Then we started hearing about copycat slappings, which we hadn’t seen coming, and doctors complained about patients having perforated eardrums from being Tango’d. We were gutted but our bosses were cool. They said: “It’s out there now. Everybody’s talking about it.” To an extent, our job was done, which enabled us to do all the sequels. It boosted Tango sales by 35%. They changed the branding to a black can off the back of the commercials. It’s amazing how far it spread, taking on a life of its own. You’d see fans dressed as the Tango man at football matches, painted orange with their tops off, which was quite disturbing. People still come up and tell me they got a perforated eardrum because of me. The slogan resonates to this day. I’ve seen headlines about Donald Trump’s tan, saying: “He’s been Tango’d.” Hugh Dennis, voice actor I was doing voices for Spitting Image when my agent called about a new Tango ad. They needed two sports-style pundits to describe this blink-and-you’ll-miss-it surreal moment. Ex-footballer Ray Wilkins – a lovely bloke, sadly no longer with us – was laid-back and laconic, so they wanted someone excitable as contrast. I came up with this extreme geordie commentator. A cross between Sid Waddell off the darts and Eddie Waring from rugby league. I think they had actually tried Sid Waddell himself but he wasn’t Sid Waddell-ish enough. I absolutely loved doing it – they were groundbreaking ads. The slap caused problems in school playgrounds. I thought: “Oh my god, I’m partly responsible for all these ear injuries.” But there’s always a dangerous playground craze. It was clackers in my day. The campaign ran for four years in the 90s, then was brought back in the 00s. Every six months, I’d go to a studio, chat about football with Ray, then launch into this ludicrous voice: “Wey-aye, Tony, I think we’ve got another one here!” It was huge fun but kind of exhausting. There were a limited number of takes I could do because it stretched my voice. I couldn’t do anything else for two hours afterwards because I’d screamed myself hoarse. Knowing the adverts were popular made it all the more enjoyable. People were waiting for the next one, which rarely happens. Oddly enough, I had also seen this from the other side. After university, I worked for Unilever and became brand manager of Lynx deodorant. So I could view it from a marketing perspective, going: “I wish I’d thought of this.” Because the campaign ran for ages, it brought in regular money. I didn’t buy a private island but I did OK. It was very much of its time. An orange fella in a giant nappy going up to someone in the street and slapping them around the face? You wouldn’t get away with it now – but it’s lovely to be part of such a cult classic. Most people don’t realise it was me. I’m currently in The Importance of Being Earnest in the West End with quite a young cast. When I mentioned doing the Tango voiceover, they went: “Wait, what? That was you? A middle-aged man who’s playing a vicar in Earnest?” But they absolutely all remember it."
culture_2025_nov_18_jon-stewart-trump-epstein-files-republicans.txt,culture,2025-11-18,Guardian staff,Jon Stewart on Trump’s Epstein files flip-flop: ‘This dude is flailing’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/18/jon-stewart-trump-epstein-files-republicans,"Late-night hosts tore into the next chapter of Donald Trump’s never-ending Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Jon Stewart Jon Stewart ripped into Trump on Monday evening after the president abruptly changed tack and called on House Republicans to authorize the justice department’s release of files related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender – files which Trump himself could order to be released. “If he had nothing to hide, he could have declassified and released these files himself at any time,” the Daily Show host explained. “How do I know this? A legal expert named Donald Jurisprudence Trump said so.” Stewart then played footage of Trump from 2022 in which he insisted that the president can declassify anything, at any time, just by saying so or “even by thinking about it”. “Is it possible that Trump’s whole bullshit facade is crumbling?” Stewart wondered. “I mean, right now, all he can do is distract from one lie with what is clearly another lie.” Stewart then rolled a clip of Trump attempting that move, telling reporters: “All I want is I want for people to recognize a great job that I’ve done on pricing, on affordability.” “What planet do you live on?” Stewart responded. “Great job on affordability? My Taco Bell order is now $72!” “This dude is flailing,” he later added. “The normally reliable Trump is even struggling to deliver on his greatest gift: the cutting nickname.” Over the weekend, he took to Truth Social to call his former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene “Marjorie Taylor Brown”, explaining in parentheses that green grass turns brown when it rots. “You know, I’ve always said that the best nicknames are the ones you have to explain in parentheses,” Stewart joked. Jokes aside, Stewart concluded: “Epstein was a convicted sex offender at the time of these emails. And of course, mentioned in these emails more than anyone else, more than 1,600 times, is Donald Trump.” “Is that evidence of his guilt? No,” he continued. “But it shows that he’s a part of that world and certainly the circumstantial evidence points to his understanding of what was occurring.” Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert homed in on one specific email from Epstein, in which the late pedophile claimed Trump “knew about the girls”. The line prompted Republicans to accuse Democrats of cherrypicking. “Let’s pause there,” said Colbert. “Guys, for this one, let’s maybe go with a different fruit. “So to prove that the Democrats were, let’s say, pineapple-choosing,” he continued, “House Republicans released 20,000-plus pages of other Epstein documents. “They did it to show that they were way more transparent than the Democrats, who they say released just enough to make Trump look bad,” said Colbert. “And they were right because the Republicans’ additional release of documents made him look awful.” In the new batch of documents, Trump’s named appeared more than 1,500 times. “These are not casual mentions, either,” Colbert noted. In one email, Epstein wrote: “i have met some very bad people ,, none as bad as trump. not one decent cell in his body.” “It’s gotta hurt when Jeffrey Epstein calls you a bad guy,” said Colbert. “That’s like an airport muffin accusing you of being dry.” Seth Meyers “This weekend, Trump sought to quell the Maga furor by ordering an investigation, but only into Democrats,” Seth Meyers explained on Monday’s Late Night. “Which even some Republicans fear could be another delay tactic.” As Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky put it: “If they have ongoing investigations in certain areas, those documents can’t be released. So this might be a big smokescreen, these investigations, to open up a bunch of them as a last-ditch effort to prevent the release of the Epstein files.” “How dare you accuse the president of setting up a smokescreen,” Meyers laughed. “For one thing, I don’t think he’s nimble enough for that. If Trump threw down a smoke pellet, he wouldn’t run away. He would just stand there coughing until the smoke cleared.” Reporters asked Trump about Massie’s statement on Sunday night, and “all Trump had to do was make clear that he was sincerely interested in getting to the truth”, said Meyers. Instead, Trump claimed “fake news” and said the media “kept bringing [Epstein] up to deflect from the tremendous success of the Trump administration”. “Nailed it!” Meyers joked. “Everyone knows the least suspicious thing you can do when someone asks you about a scandal is to say ‘I don’t want to talk about it’ and then immediately insult. Try that next time your spouse asks why you got home so late.” And then Trump flip-flopped again, telling House Republicans to vote for a discharge petition for the justice department’s release of the Epstein files, after he spent months opposing the measure. “But the whole point of the House vote was to force you to release the files, which you can do on your own. So if you’re in favor of releasing the files, then just do it,” said Meyers. “This new position makes even less sense.” Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel looked ahead to a House vote, possibly as early as Tuesday, to authorize the release of the files, with dozens of Republicans expected to break ranks. “Which has forced Trump to now claim that he’s for the files being released,” Kimmel noted. “After almost a year of saying he didn’t want them released, after a year of stalling, hedging, browbeating members of his own party, last night, all of a sudden, Trump reversed course completely.” Trump posted on Truth Social: “As I said on Friday night aboard Air Force One to the Fake News Media, House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide.” “We have nothing to hide?” Kimmel laughed. “There’s no ‘we’. ‘We’ have nothing to hide. It’s just you. “If you have nothing hide, why even have the vote?” he added. “Why not just have the Department of Justice release the files now? “After 10 months of fighting tooth and nail, doing everything he could to keep the files secret, he’s now asking for a full release,” Kimmel continued, “which is what got all these guys in trouble in the first place. “So his plan now is hurry up and release the files so I can start saying they’re fake.” Trump also instructed Pam Bondi, his attorney general, to investigate prominent Democrats’ ties to Epstein. “Which is like Diddy ordering an investigation into why there were so many bottles of baby oil in his house,” Kimmel joked."

You don’t put up a fight. You merely walk with them to their car, trying to object in the only way you know how: asking nicely for them to stop. The kidnappers are gleeful; they’ve finally captured you, George Kaplan. That’s not your name, you exclaim, you’re Roger Thornhill! They must have the wrong man! Thus begins Hitchcock’s funniest, most ridiculous and visually ambitious film, North by Northwest. All the hallmarks of a Hitchcock classic are here: Cary Grant as the leading man, a completely inexplicable MacGuffin (who is George Kaplan anyway? And more importantly, does anyone even care?), a director cameo, a mysterious and beautiful blonde (the darling and charming Eva Marie Saint), and a 20-minute opening so overstuffed with dialogue that you kind of tune out but it’s fine because once the inciting incident happens, you can’t look away. It’s so Hitchcockian that it borders on parody. Released in 1959 and coming in hot after Hitchcock’s most famous Technicolor nailbiters (including Rear Window and Vertigo, heard of them?), North by Northwest is clearly the work of a film-maker who already knows his success is preordained. He can go absurd, so why not? There is absolutely no reason Cary Grant, painted in three coats of fake tan as always, should be free climbing Mount Rushmore, dodging bullets from Lincoln’s giant rocky nose after being chased around the US by an underground anti-government movement. Grant as Thornhill is one of the most underrated comedic performances of the 20th century. Every single character he meets in this film is very clearly working to screw him over, yet he remains surprised at every turn. He is like a bronzed Homer Simpson in a well-tailored suit, blindly walking into every trap and then believing he can merely talk his way out of it. You want to shake him by the shoulders and scream: CARY, WAKE UP! Despite being made in the thick of Hollywood’s conservative Hays Code, North by Northwest is hornier than any modern blockbuster. Grant and Saint can barely keep their hands off each other in their shared train carriage, and the film ends with an infamous shot of a steam train racing full steam ahead into a snug and innuendo-heavy tunnel. It’s hard to imagine anything as erotic in a Marvel film. In one of the film’s most storied scenes, Grant flees from an aeroplane in an epic chase through a cornfield. Out of context, it seems random and illogical. In context, it still makes no sense. Why wouldn’t the villains just shoot him? Why concoct a plan to try to mow him down with a plane in the middle of nowhere? And that is the core thesis of the film. There is no reason other than it looks fabulous on screen, and that’s why Hitchcock is the master. As long as it looks gorgeous and the stakes are high, reason can be shoehorned into anything. Just as Grant dusts himself off after each life-or-death struggle and immediately emerges ready to trust again, it’s impossible not to enter every absurd scene in North by Northwest with blind wonder and intrigue. Over and over and over again. North by Northwest is streaming on HBO Max in Australia and available to rent in the UK and the US. For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia, click here"
culture_2025_nov_18_why-dont-conservatives-get-credit-for-culture-funding.txt,culture,2025-11-18,Unknown Author,Why don’t Conservatives get credit for culture funding?,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/18/why-dont-conservatives-get-credit-for-culture-funding,"Helen Marriage, a hugely respected cultural leader, writes that “there is no political party that will commit to the kind of investment needed to keep a living art and culture ecology alive” (Durham’s Lumiere festival was a beacon of hope and togetherness – we cannot let the lights go out on the rest of the arts, 11 November). But she also places the responsibility on all of us. She wants the culture sector to make a better case. But can it? As commissioner for culture in the last government, I remain surprised that large funding decisions directed at culture have been forgotten, devalued and ignored, perhaps because the sources were then from a Conservative government. During Covid, culture was the only economic sector to receive its own rapid, specially designed, comprehensive rescue package. The £2bn culture recovery fund took care of more than 5,000 organisations around the country. Many large regional funds, such as those for levelling up, towns and borderlands, directed billions into culture-led projects. Aviva Studios in Manchester, Bristol Beacon, V&amp;A East, Shakespeare North in Prescot, Wentworth Woodhouse in Rotherham and the incipient Eden Project in Morecambe are just a few examples – all hugely ambitious culture and heritage projects funded by the government, working closely with local authorities. Film tax reliefs are vital to encourage inward international investment. But when Rishi Sunak ensured tax credits were also extended to theatre, museums and orchestras, where was the welcome? When the Arts Council announced its (increased) funding round in 2022, there was ferocious negative attention directed on the few organisations that were unsuccessful in their bids and no focus at all on the 275 organisations funded for the very first time all over the country. Follow the money. These were very large chunks of funding directed to the culture sector. Privately, some culture leaders were thrilled, but it was a gratitude that had to be hidden. The majority of recipients were silent because the Conservative narrative doesn’t fit their worldview. Of course, there’s much more that can be done. But if the culture sector won’t recognise and welcome attention from politicians of all parties and the hard graft of officials when it lands, they can’t expect politicians to stay the course – they must follow their voters.

culture_2025_nov_19_british-museum-ends-sponsorship-from-japanese-tobacco-firm-jti.txt,culture,2025-11-19,Lanre Bakare Arts and culture correspondent,British Museum ends ‘deeply troubling’ sponsorship from Japanese tobacco firm,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/19/british-museum-ends-sponsorship-from-japanese-tobacco-firm-jti,"The British Museum has ended a controversial sponsorship deal with a Japanese tobacco firm after reports that the government had raised questions about the deal, which some critics said was “deeply troubling”. The Guardian understands that the museum’s board chose to not renew the 15-year partnership with Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which ended in September. The pressure group Culture Unstained submitted a freedom of information request earlier this year, which it says revealed correspondence sent in January in which the government raised questions about the details of the deal. The Times reports that the Department of Health and Social Care told the Department for Culture, Media and Sport that the deal could be a breach of the World Health Organization’s framework convention on tobacco control (FCTC). The framework bars states from advertising and promoting smoking products. JTI’s name was recently removed from the museum’s website, a move that coincided with the release of a report published by the Tobacco Control Research Group that said the sponsorship deal was a key part of the firm’s lobbying strategy. JTI still sponsors the Royal Academy of Arts and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The move was welcomed by critics, who had been calling for an end to the deal since 2016, when 1,000 experts signed an open letter to the British Museum and the Royal Academy over what they called the morally unacceptable sponsorship by JTI. Dr Allen Gallagher, the co-director of the Tobacco Control Research Group at the University of Bath, said such agreements “enable a deadly industry to use UK cultural institutions as a way to try and improve its public image”. The Labour MP Dr Simon Opher, who is a GP, said: “I find it deeply troubling that a national cultural institution has been sponsored by a tobacco company for 15 years in clear breach of WHO guidelines.” He said there were no circumstances in which public bodies should be “legitimising an industry that profits from harm”. A British Museum spokesperson said the institution was grateful for JTI’s support and that sponsorship was a crucial way for it to secure its financial future. “The museum operates on public and private funding, which ensures the magnificent collection remains free and accessible to the public for centuries to come,” they said. “As a public body we have an obligation to ensure the long-term financial stability of the museum by securing funding from a number of sources. Their support enabled the museum to significantly increase accessibility and engagement with the collection for under-represented adults.” The decision again highlights the controversies surrounding sponsorship of cultural institutions in the UK, which have often centred on the British Museum. The organisation was heavily criticised when it signed a 10-year £50m deal with BP in 2023 that was called “astonishingly out of touch”. The Guardian understands the museum is not conducting a review of current sponsorships, but the BP deal continues to hang over the museum. When it held its inaugural Pink Ball in October, which raised £2.5m, protests about the BP sponsorship disrupted the event. Climate activists have previously held several other protests in the museum. The museum’s leadership has continued to defend the deal. Its director, Nicholas Cullinan, has said he uses two criteria to weigh up donations and sponsorship. “One is: was the money legally acquired? The other is: will accepting it cause us reputational damage?” he said shortly after starting at the museum. “I think you have to have very good, clear reasons for turning down money that would help to keep the British Museum free to the public.” Members of the Museums Association, an industry body, voted last month to adopt a code of ethics that expects museums to transition away from sponsorship by “organisations involved with environmental harm – including fossil fuels – human rights abuses, and other sponsorship that does not align with the values of the museum”."

Jimmy Kimmel Tuesday was “a very big day” in Washington DC, said Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday evening, as both the House and Senate voted near unanimously to authorize the justice department to release investigative files related to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. “Ultimately even [speaker] Mike Johnson voted yes on releasing the files,” Kimmel noted, meaning that the bill now heads to the White House, where it will probably66 be signed by Trump. “The goal was to have the bill pass by such a large margin that Trump can’t put his little orange thumb on the scale and give it the old Cheeto veto,” he explained. “But make no mistake: this isn’t over. He’s not giving up. If anyone thinks he’s going to release all of the Epstein files, I’ve got a beautiful East Wing of the White House to sell you.” That’s because even after the vote, “Trump cronies” in the justice department still have the power to withhold information to “protect ongoing investigations, protect innocent people or for reasons of national security”. “But they would never do anything like that, would they?” Kimmel joked. “They’re sworn to protect the constitution of the United States! “Something is fishy,” he added. “Trump rolled over faster than that dog Ghislaine Maxwell gets to play with in her country club prison.” On that note: “It is amazing the kind of special treatment you get when half of the most powerful people from the last 30 years don’t want to see you testifying in court.” Stephen Colbert “When it comes to Congress, it’s increasingly rare that things happen,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. Which made Tuesday, when the House voted 427-1 to release the Epstein files, all the more notable. The measure then headed to the Senate, which passed it unanimously overnight, after the Late Show taping. “Tomorrow, we might know everything he and his pervert buddies did,” said Colbert. “Meaning it’s Epstein Rockin’ Eve – stay up for a ball drop you’re gonna want to miss.” The vote marked “a huge loss for Trump, make no mistake”, he continued. “For going on four months now, Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson fought the release of the Epstein files with every congressional tool they had, and keep in mind: Congress is loaded with some major tools.” “But when it looked like Republicans were defecting en masse and they were going to lose big, they were suddenly all in, like they always were – right, Mike?” Colbert then played a clip of Johnson claiming that “Republicans support maximum transparency. We always have. The president of the United States supports maximum transparency.” “Yes, the president has always supported maximum transparency, a healthy diet of leafy greens and the understated androgynous sensuality of a flat-chested woman,” Colbert mocked. “The president would be here, but he can’t talk right now as he’s jogging to Bible study.” Colbert also criticized Trump’s chummy White House visit with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. And when a reporter brought up the murder of the journalist and regime critic Jamal Khashoggi, which US intelligence concluded was authorized by the crown prince, Trump reacted angrily. “Things happen, but he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,” he said. “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.” “Yes, how dare you embarrass our guest!” Colbert mocked. “Now he’s going to feel all self-conscious when he tries to chop up somebody like you.” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers returned to a meeting earlier this month between Trump and representatives from Switzerland, in which they gifted the president a special Rolex desktop clock and a 1kg personalized gold bar. “So now foreign officials are just openly giving him gold?” he wondered. “Trump’s turning into a live-action political cartoon. Next time, someone’s going to give him a big sack with a dollar sign on it.” In a new interview with a British rightwing news channel, Trump said that people will ask him: “What do you recommend for growing your children?” “I don’t know if I want advice on raising children from someone who doesn’t even know it’s called ‘raising children’,” Meyers said, laughing. In the same interview, Trump said: “I’ve never had a drink in my life, and I don’t take drugs.” “Maybe one of the best endorsements I’ve ever heard for drinking and doing drugs,” Meyers quipped."
culture_2025_nov_20_late-night-epstein-files.txt,culture,2025-11-20,Guardian staff,Seth Meyers on Epstein files: ‘It’s obvious why Trump fought so hard to stop this bill from passing’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/20/late-night-epstein-files,"Late-night hosts reacted to the congressional vote sending the bill to release all files related to late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein to the desk of his former friend Donald Trump. Seth Meyers It was a tough Tuesday for Trump, who lost his months-long battle to stop the release of the Epstein files on Tuesday after Congress passed a bill forcing the justice department publish them. “So now Trump is doing a 180,” said Seth Meyers on Wednesday’s Late Night. “He says he’ll sign the bill that forces him to release the files he could’ve released on his own but wouldn’t, thus requiring a bill to force him to do the thing he didn’t want to do that he’ll now be forced to do because of the bill he was against that he will now sign.” “It’s obvious why Trump fought so hard to stop this bill from passing,” Meyers later added. “He called Republicans who supported it stupid, called the files a hoax made up by Democrats, his team held an emergency meeting in the White House situation room to sway Republicans to vote against it, and he called Marjorie Taylor Greene a traitor.” Greene, a far-right Republican and former ally of the president, got the last word on Tuesday. Speaking outside Congress, she said: “I was called a traitor by a man that I fought five, no actually six years for … Let me tell you what a traitor is. A traitor is an American who serves foreign countries and themselves.” “In fairness, she didn’t say Trump’s name. She could’ve been talking about anybody,” said Meyers. “Maybe she was referring to a different president who does deals with foreign governments and has a secret Chinese bank account and got a crown from South Korea and a plane from Qatar and a gold bar from Switzerland.” And also the guy who meets with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, at the White House, in a chummy photo op where Trump dismissed questions about MBS’s involvement in the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “Trump’s whole vibe in this meeting is a reminder not to trust him when he tells you he cut ties with Epstein after learning the truth about him. That’s Mohammed bin Salman,” Meyers added, mocking the president – “you call him MBS, I call him Bone Saw!” Jimmy Kimmel “We are now one step closer to answering the question: what did the president know and how old were these women when he knew it?” said Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday, after Congress voted overwhelmingly, 427-1, to authorize the release of the Epstein files. “It was such a landslide that Trump might actually be able to rebury the Epstein files under it,” Kimmel quipped. “Usually when Trump gets a bill, he declares bankruptcy and doesn’t pay it,” he continued. “But this one, he’s going to have to sign it. Or at least he says he’s going to sign it, which means there’s about maybe a 12% chance he will.” “Trump hasn’t been this nervous about signing something since Don Jr’s birth certificate,” he joked. Hours after Kimmel’s taping, Trump signed the bill into law. Kimmel also mocked the House speaker, Mike Johnson, who fled the scene while telling reporters he was “deeply disappointed” in the vote and had “concerns” about the bill without redactions to supposedly “protect the innocent”. “They are so scared of Trump,” Kimmel mused. “What is going on? Is he beating them? I don’t get it. They just blindly defend him. They don’t know what’s in those files! They’re taking his word for it. They’re taking the word of someone who paid a porn star $130,000 and claims he didn’t do anything with her.” Even if Trump does sign the bill, it’s still unclear whether the justice department will actually release all the files, or have some files tied up in investigations – “specifically, investigations Trump orders to keep them tied up in investigations,” Kimmel noted. “And that is where things will get interesting. Will we have the original documents? Or is Trump going to pull a Taylor Swift and give us The Epstein Files (Donnie’s Version)? We might not ever know.” Stephen Colbert And on The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also celebrated the congressional vote, which “then left the bill on Trump’s desk like a flaming bag of poop. Very hard to put gold leaf on that.” “What’s he going to do?” he wondered. “Now remember, Trump already tried to do everything possible to keep this from ever happening.” As president, Colbert reminded, Trump could have released the files at any moment; he did not, and never explained why. “And when the discharge petition to release the files started, he sent his minions to warn all the Republicans that voting to release the files would be seen as a ‘hostile act’,” even dragging far-right congresswoman Lauren Boebert into the situation room to pressure her to drop her support for the measure. “And when all of that failed, and it looked like he was going to lose, Trump suddenly flipped, and said that everybody should for it,” he explained. “And they did. Hence, the poop flambé.” One question remained for Colbert, who taped before Trump signed the bill: “Is he going to sign it? Is he going to not sign it and change his name to Signor Ramon and flee to Acapulco?” The new law requires the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, to make all unclassified documents related to Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell publicly available within 30 days, or before 19 December – “Just in time for my pervert advent calendar,” Colbert joked. “What do we got today? Oh, this chocolate looks like Jared from Subway.”"
culture_2025_nov_21_fox-news-life-jesus-podcast.txt,culture,2025-11-21,Adrian Horton,Kristen Bell and Brian Cox among actors shocked they’re attached to Fox News podcast,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/21/fox-news-life-jesus-podcast,"The Fox News announcement of a new podcast series on Jesus Christ has turned into a bizarre holiday tale in Hollywood, as several actors attached to massive, 52-episode project claim their recordings date back 15 years and are being released without their prior knowledge. The new audiobook titled The Life of Jesus Christ Podcast, announced on Wednesday as part of a splashy rollout for the network’s new Christian vertical called Fox Faith, purports to guide listeners “through the life, teachings, and miracles of Jesus Christ”, with each episode introduced by Fox &amp; Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt. The announcement boasted that more than 100 actors had signed on to participate in the project, with a voice cast including Kristen Bell as Mary Magdalene, Sean Astin as Matthew, Neal McDonough as Jesus, Brian Cox as the Voice of God, Malcolm McDowell as Caiaphas, John Rhys-Davies as the narrator and Julia Ormond as Mary. But reps for Bell claim that the actor was blindsided by the announcement, as she had recorded the audio 15 years ago. She only learned that Fox planned to release a podcast with her name attached the day before the announcement, when her team received an invitation to appear on Fox &amp; Friends the following day, her reps told Rolling Stone. Her team added that she never gave permission for the original audiobook – The Truth and Life Dramatized Audio Bible, released in 2010 and acquired by Fox News Media via a licensing deal with a company called Gulfstream Studios – to be repurposed into a new podcast. Reps for Cox, McDowell and Rhys-Davies confirmed to Rolling Stone that they were similarly shocked by the news, with some only learning of the new podcast as news of Bell’s confusion circulated on Thursday. “Brian recorded audio for a project over a decade ago,” a rep for Cox said in a statement. “He was unaware that the audio would be repurposed for a new podcast series in 2025. Brian only became aware of the podcast today.” A spokesperson for McDowell said that the team “found out about it when everyone else did. We were never consulted, nothing was renegotiated, and we would not have approved.” A rep for Rhys-Davies said the actor learned of the “repurposed” project earlier this week. Rolling Stone also obtained a note from a producer associated with the new podcast at Fox, in which they requested a celebrity cast member “not mention that this audio New Testament Bible was produced years ago, we’d like it to feel like something that was produced more recently”. According to the magazine, Fox News repurposed the 15-year-old, 23-hour audiobook into a multi-part podcast series with new additions from Earhardt. While some actors purportedly involved with the new podcast have spoken openly about their Christian faith, others have been critical of Fox News or the closely associated Trump administration. Cox has previously referred to the rightwing news network as “the devil”. A spokesperson for Fox News told Rolling Stone that “Gulfstream Studios produced The Life of Jesus Podcast from The Truth and Life Dramatized Audio Bible, which was licensed by Fox News Audio, with full cooperation and participation by all the actors involved”. The new podcast is part of a larger push by Fox News Media into Christian-themed programming, as it tries to lure more subscribers to its Fox Nation subscription service. “I think there is an insatiable appetite among a very passionate audience that is underserved,” Jason Klarman, the chief digital and marketing officer at Fox News Media, told Variety this week. Earhardt previously helped launch Fox Nation with a Bible study program. The Life of Jesus Christ Podcast is set to launch on 30 November tied to the Christian calendar, with 13-episode installments dropping at the start of the Advent, during Christmas week, the beginning of Lent and Palm Sunday."
culture_2025_nov_21_has-tv-gone-down-the-youtube-how-the-platform-changed-how-we-consume-and-create-media.txt,culture,2025-11-21,Sasha Mistlin,"The Guide #218: For gen Zers like me, YouTube isn’t an app or a website – it’s the backdrop to our waking lives",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/21/has-tv-gone-down-the-youtube-how-the-platform-changed-how-we-consume-and-create-media,"Barely a month goes by without more news of streaming sites overtaking traditional, terrestrial TV. Predominant among those sits YouTube, with more than 2.5 billion monthly viewers. For people my age – a sprightly 28 – and younger, YouTube is less of an app or website than our answer to radio: the ever-present background hum of modern life. While my mum might leave Radio 4 wittering or BBC News flickering in the corner as she potters about the house, I’ve got a video essay about Japan’s unique approach to urban planning playing on my phone. That’s not to say I never watch more traditional TV (although 99% of the time I’m accessing it through some other kind of subscription streaming app), but when I get home after a long day and the thought of ploughing through another hour of grim prestige fare feels too demanding, I’m probably watching YouTube. Which means it’s very unlikely that I’m watching the same thing as you. When Google paid $1.65bn for the platform in 2006, (just 18 months after it launched) the price seemed astronomical. Critics questioned whether that valuation could be justified for any video platform. The logic was simple – unless YouTube could replace television, it would never be worth it. Nearly two decades on, that framing undersells what actually happened. YouTube didn’t just replace television – it invented entirely new forms of content: vodcasts, vlogs, video essays, reaction videos, ASMR and its heinous cousin mukbang. The platform absorbed new trends and formats at lightning speed, building what became an alternative “online mainstream”. Before podcasters, TikTokers, Substackers and even influencers, there were YouTubers. I started paying for YouTube Premium during Covid, when I had an abundance of time, and spare cash without the need to commute or the potential of buying pints. Now, it’s the only subscription that I don’t worry about the value of, but rather wonder if I use it so much that it’s changed me as a person. Alas, my gym membership does not fall into this category. The obvious advantage to the premium subscription is never seeing ads, and the smart downloads that automatically queue up episodes based on your habits have been a blessing on many a long tube journey. I’m very rarely bored these days; on my commute now, instead of staring out the window and letting my mind wander, I’m either watching sports highlights or a podcast. I no longer really think about stuff – I just go on YouTube. It’s slightly embarrassing to admit that a random deluge of shorts featuring guitar instructors and teenage garage bands has inspired me to pick up the instrument again – like admitting that you met your partner on Hinge. But that’s the thing – YouTube has democratised expertise in ways traditional media never could. It also fits in with the etiquette around media consumption on your phone. I’d never desecrate a Spielberg or Scorsese film by watching one on a 6in display. That feels vaguely heinous – disrespectful to the craft. But watching behind-the-scenes footage or promo tour clips? That’s exactly what YouTube is for. I watch a mix of YouTube-native creators – Amelia Dimoldenberg’s Chicken Shop Date, JxmyHighroller for NBA deep dives, Tifo Football for tactical analysis, Happy Sad Confused for film interviews – and a steady diet of content traditionally formatted for TV or print but which probably now reaches the biggest audience via YouTube: Graham Norton, Saturday Night Live, even fellow journalists such as Owen Jones and Mark Kermode. And sports highlights exist on the platform in a state of perfect convenience that legacy broadcasters can’t match, especially when it comes to paywalled sports such as cricket and NFL, where watching live requires an immense financial, and time, commitment. However, this convenience and entertainment isn’t without its problems. YouTube’s hyper-personalised algorithm means we’re all watching completely different things. Where previous generations had “Did you watch that thing last night?” as a universal conversation starter, now everyone’s deep in their own algorithmic bubble. We’ve gained infinite choice but lost the sense of shared experience, a shared culture. Even “big” YouTube moments fragment across demographics in ways that Saturday-night telly never did. When politicians – usually, but not exclusively, of the far right – bemoan that we live in a divided nation, they’d be better off pointing the finger at our viewing habits than the immigration figures. My algorithmic delights may well have more in common with a 28-year-old in Bengaluru than the 45-year-old living next door. There is one exception, though it’s not exactly comforting: while YouTube has fragmented viewing habits across most demographics, it’s created something close to a monoculture among young men. Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Lex Fridman and a rotating cast of Trump-adjacent podcasters and public intellectuals, including the late Charlie Kirk, have become a genuinely ubiquitous part of the water-cooler conversation among men my age. YouTube has democratised access to long-form conversation in genuinely enriching ways, but it’s also created pipelines to increasingly toxic content. The platform’s algorithm doesn’t just surface what you’re interested in – it surfaces what keeps you watching, and that’s not always the same thing. It has a tendency to boost extreme viewpoints and fringe theories by taking you on a journey from something entirely harmless to genuinely dangerous misinformation so gradually and organically that you barely notice it happening. And with everyone in your demographic experiencing the same, it’s hard for the community to police itself. According to recent data, YouTube users globally watch over 1bn hours of content every day. For better or worse, YouTube has won, and I’m mostly OK with that. I certainly don’t miss having to consult a ratty TV guide to know what BBC Two will be showing at 9pm. But perhaps the balance needs redressing – not so much between YouTube and other platforms, but between YouTube and literally everything else. I’m not exactly sure what the solution is … but I bet there’s a video essay that could tell me exactly what I should think.

culture_2025_nov_21_stephen-colbert-trump-epstein-files.txt,culture,2025-11-21,Guardian staff,Stephen Colbert on Trump v Epstein files: ‘Fighting tooth and cankle’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/21/stephen-colbert-trump-epstein-files,"Late-night hosts reacted to Donald Trump signing a bill to release the Epstein files while still trying to distract from them. Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert celebrated the impending release of all files related to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. “After months of Trump fighting tooth and cankle to hold back the Republican party from doing the right thing, he just went ahead and gave up and signed the bill to release the Epstein files,” the Late Show host explained a day after Congress voted near unanimously to compel the justice department to make the files public within 30 days. “Even though Trump told Republicans to all vote for this, he was clearly furious that they did,” Colbert continued. Trump signed the bill after the White House issued a so-called photo lid, which shut down any on-camera opportunities. “He signed it off camera, and he’ll sign anything on camera – executive orders, sneakers, lady parts, wall parts, a toddler,” he added over clips of Trump’s many strange autograph photo ops. “Trump is avoiding cameras. That’s like the Pillsbury doughboy avoiding nudity. “More proof that these files are making Trump soil his ample briefs?” On Wednesday night, Trump took to Truth Social with a “full, Unabomber-length manifesto” blaming Democrats. “Imagine, if you got that as a text,” said Colbert as he scrolled through the screed. “Somewhere in that Apple terms and conditions-length screed, Trump tried to claim credit for the thing he desperately fought to stop.” As Trump put it: “As everyone knows, I asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, to pass this bill … Because of this request, the votes were almost unanimous in favor of passage.” “So you know, in a way, he won,” Colbert deadpanned. “It reminds me of Julius Caesar’s famous last words: ‘Great job, Brute!’” Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also mocked Trump’s tome-length attempt to claim credit for the release of the files. “Don’t try that move where you say ‘and everyone knows … ’ in hopes that we’re all going to say, ‘Everyone? But I didn’t know. Am I out of the loop?’” he laughed. “Everyone knows the opposite was true, because we saw it with our own eyes. You can try to get away with saying ‘As everyone knows, I have a huge penis.’ But don’t do it while you’re changing at the gym, because people are going to check. “Let’s not forget, the same guy who is now claiming he told the House and the Senate to pass a bill to release the Epstein files also claimed not long ago that those same files were fake,” Meyers added. Moreover, Trump continued to pressure Republicans to back off the files this week, fuming that the attention on Epstein “deflects from the great job we’ve done”. “If there’s nothing bad in the Epstein files for you, then why would it deflect from the great job you’ve done?” Meyers wondered. “That just sounds even more suspicious. That’s like if your spouse asked to look at your phone, and you respond, ‘I don’t want my DMs on Instagram to distract from how great our marriage is.’” The Epstein files, capturing the public’s attention at a time when grocery prices are soaring in part due to Trump’s tariffs, represents “the greatest test yet of Trump’s nearly mystical ability to lie his way out of any problem”, said Meyers. “He can lie about corruption or climate change or healthcare or fake wars that he fake solved, but he can’t lie about numbers people see with their own eyes every day at the grocery store. “Trump is learning the same hard truth that Joe Biden and the Democrats learned last year: you can’t Jedi mind-trick people into thinking the economy is better than what they feel in their lives every day.” Jimmy Kimmel After ripping Trump for once again attempting to get him fired, Jimmy Kimmel then poked fun at the president being snubbed from Dick Cheney’s funeral. “All you need to know about what an explosively unstable disaster this man is for this country, is that Dick Cheney – Dick Cheney – voted for not just a liberal Democrat, a Black female liberal Democrat, over him, his fellow conservative Republican,” he said. “That’s it! You don’t need to know anything else to know what a garden hose full of diarrhea this presidency has been.” Kimmel also touched on Trump’s Truth Social manifesto on the Epstein files. “He signed the bill and then posted this giant run-on sentence taking credit for the fact that the bill got passed. It wouldn’t have passed without him! Another legislative triumph.” The justice department now has 30 days to release the files, “which will make for a very merry Christmas indeed”, said Kimmel. “I have a prediction for the next 30 days. I think we’re going to see Trump do some of the craziest shit yet. I think he’s taking it up to a level 11 in the next 30 days. He’s already started.” Kimmel pointed to a group of six Democratic lawmakers, all of whom served in the military or the intelligence community, who grew so concerned about Trump’s handling of the armed forces that they made a video reminding troops that they are not legally required to follow illegal orders. Trump, of course, took to Truth Social again, calling the video “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!!” that was “punishable by DEATH!” “He all-capped his pants on this one,” Kimmel laughed. “No big deal though, just the president of the United States musing about Congress-people being executed.”"
culture_2025_nov_22_australia-renaissance-medieval-fairs-booming-knights-jousting-squires-wizards.txt,culture,2025-11-21,Patrick Marlborough,"After 10 years talking to knights, squires and wizards, I understand why ren fairs are booming",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/22/australia-renaissance-medieval-fairs-booming-knights-jousting-squires-wizards,"“I dunno what to tell ya, mate,” a young knight once told me through his helm’s lifted visor. “Gettin’ shield bashed just feels good.” For the knaves among thee, a “shield bash” is what it sounds like: to bash, or be bashed, with a shield. It’s simple and to the point, like a mace to the face or an arrow to the knee. Witnessing a shield bash, you understand the “haha yesss” that the basher must feel upon bashing, just as you empathetically presume a long “oh noooooo” on behalf of the bashee. So I was surprised to learn being bashed was, in itself, just as fun. “When it’s ya bro doin’ the bashin’ it just feels good,” the knight continued, after a muddy melee at Balingup’s 2017 medieval fair. “Like, mate earned it. We’re bonded in mud.” For close to 10 years, I have been speaking with knights, rogues, wizards, petty lords and bandits of all stripes, ostensibly for “literary” reasons. I am not a Larper (live action role player), nor am I particularly fascinated by the ins-and-outs of historical re-enactments or the low hum of horniness that runs through all renaissance fairs. I am, however, fascinated by stories and characters, especially those we forge to make life and loneliness bearable in this particularly lonely and unbearable epoch we find ourselves living in. Be it the artificial selves we construct on social media, or a warlock with lore as dense as a Warhammer codex, everyone is striving to find themselves, and others like them, through their personal mythopias. “I have always known I am a dragon,” a Dragonkin once told me during a chance encounter at a bar in Williamsburg, New York. “My dragon self is my true self, not … whatever this is.” Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning It’s an encounter that stuck with me. In an age where identity is everything, why settle for the default character presets? If life is one long role play anyway, you might as well lean in. You find variations of this epiphany among the dedicated lifers of Australia’s many medieval and renaissance fairs, which range in scope, scale and grandeur and encompass varying levels of verisimilitude, self-seriousness and mace-related injuries. If the scene can be said to have a hub – a Minas Tirith, if you will – then it is Kryal Castle, a literal castle 15 minutes drive from Ballarat, which hosts the largest ren fairs in Australia. Built in the early 70s by a refrigerator salesman, Kryal Castle epitomises the heady mix of historical accuracy and anachronism that makes this scene so fascinating: the sort of place where you’ll witness a big bloke in full plate mail chugging on a vape, or two girls in handmaiden garb filming K-pop dances for their TikTok. I find myself there in September, sitting among the lords and ladies in the royal box watching the national jousting tournament, muttering “ah jeez” and “fuck me dead” to myself at every tilt, charge and collision. I watch a heavily armoured knight and their squire lean in for a selfie together, before turning to see Lady Tamsen, who I’ve bet a Coke on, square up against her opponent. An hour earlier, I spoke to her and her squire (the knight’s equivalent of a PA) in the stables. “There’s different companies that are, like, just jousting groups,” she says, her silver helmet tucked under her arm. “It’s kind of like your local footy club.” Lady Tamsen’s squire tightens the straps on her breastplate as she explains how she fell into charging at people in armour on horseback wielding very long sticks. “I started going to the local medieval festival. My family would take me there as a little family outing. It took me about 10 years before I found [senior knight and champion jouster Sir Andrew McKinnon] and messaged him on Facebook and said ‘please train me.’” She paints a portrait of a vast network of diehards, enthusiasts and acolytes, spread across Australia. She is from The Company of the Hound, based out of Tarago, New South Wales, but she lists a few others: the Company of the Black Spur in Victoria; The Company of the Griffin in Queensland; and my home town team, The Grey Company from Perth, of which my young shield-basher was a proud member. Each of these offer up intimate communities, all nestled within the vaster one surrounding the hobby itself. It is a fellowship, where shared interest fosters friendships that become something closer to family. “I am completely dependent on my squire,” Tamsen laughs, and her squire laughs in turn: “She’s basically a big metal toddler.” Between them, you get the sense of a sisterhood, as long and well balanced as the lance clutched in Tamsen’s armoured fist. Within these re-enacted histories, real histories form. Simulacrums of traditions become tradition in their own right, similarly transformed by changing trends, tastes and tolerances. Brendan Crawford, who runs Keipa’s Carpentry – making bespoke wooden swords and more – has a history with Kryal Castle as long as his wizard-appropriate beard. He lived there back in the days when that was not uncommon for the more hardcore re-enactors, and speaks fondly of its wilder early years, reminiscing wistfully about certain things that have fallen by the wayside, such as “Naughty Night”, where kids threw (sponge) stones at a knight locked in a pillory for public drunkenness or “farting before the queen”. He cackles remembering a three-year-old girl solemnly approaching the pun-spewing lout knight, squaring him up and striking him between the eyes with a sponge. This isn’t a hobby for Crawford, but a way of life. You can see this in the quality of his work – wooden training swords and daggers made from ironbark, weighted like the real thing, the kind that young lordlings would have been trained with by a castle’s master at arms in the Ye Olde Days. “They had a way of doing things back then that demands your full attention,” he intones, after spouting off a history of the great swordsmiths throughout the ages. “They’re reaching through the past, sitting besides you as you hone your craft as they did. It’s calming. I find it very peaceful … and fun!” As Australia’s loneliness epidemic worsens, people are spending more and more time online, atomised and disconnected, locked in the pillory of isolation. But visiting ren fairs, I’ve met so many young people, especially those from marginalised communities, who’ve found regeneration through re-enactments and reinventions of centuries-old culture and customs; found a sense of purpose and connectedness that contemporary life – which has locked so many of us into a digital serfdom – has otherwise cut us off from. “I joined the community as a depressed uni student,” musician and artist Elise Josephine tells me. “Everyone welcomed me with the joke that ‘It’s cheaper than therapy.’ I was apprehensive, thinking that I would be infected by some higher form of cringe every time I put on a bit more armour or rp’ed [roleplayed] a death, until I found out that the more you try to act aloof, the less you get out of it, and in turn, life itself. “Truly no other hobby in my life has taught me to reject the pursuit of being a main character. Being a scrubby squire is where it is at … sometimes there really isn’t anything as good as getting a large sword and pelting some good friends.” Patrick Marlborough is the author of Nock Loose (A$34.99, Fremantle Press) a postmodern novel revolving around a hyper-violent medieval fair in Western Australia’s South West.

The Thing With Feathers Out now Max Porter’s novel Grief Is the Thing With Feathers gets the big-screen treatment, with Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role as the dad who must raise his two young children alone after his wife dies unexpectedly.

But though the other lead here is a 15-year-old girl, this is no Disney fable, but a tale of idols and obsession.

culture_2025_nov_23_he-was-just-trying-to-earn-a-few-kopecks-how-newly-translated-stories-reveal-chekhovs-silly-side.txt,culture,2025-11-23,Viv Groskop,‘He was just trying to earn a few kopecks’: how newly translated stories reveal Chekhov’s silly side,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/23/he-was-just-trying-to-earn-a-few-kopecks-how-newly-translated-stories-reveal-chekhovs-silly-side,"Few writers are as universally admired as Chekhov. As Booker winner George Saunders puts it, “Chekhov – shall I be blunt? – is the greatest short story writer who ever lived.” Novelists from Ann Patchett to Zadie Smith cite him as an inspiration. His plays The Seagull, Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya and The Cherry Orchard still pack out theatres internationally. In the past year alone, Andrew Scott wowed audiences in his one-man Vanya for London’s National Theatre and Cate Blanchett took on the role of Arkadina in The Seagull at the Barbican. But how much did you know about his silly side? Anton Chekhov: Earliest Stories offers the first comprehensive translation in English of the stories, novellas and humoresques that the Russian author wrote in the early 1880s. And it is supremely juvenile in the best way. The reason many of these stories are now appearing in translation for the first time is because, explains editor Rosamund Bartlett, they have never been regarded by commercial publishers as “worthy” of Chekhov’s reputation. They are too childishly comical. During the translation process, she says, “we would just collapse in fits of giggles”. Bartlett, the author of acclaimed biographies of Chekhov and Tolstoy, and her co-editor Elena Michajlowska, a UK-based Russian film-maker, run the Anton Chekhov Foundation, a charity whose starry patrons include Ralph Fiennes, Tom Stoppard and Kenneth Branagh. The foundation was originally set up to preserve Chekhov’s White Dacha in Yalta. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 this work was no longer possible, so instead they came up with the “crazy, idealistic idea” of sourcing 80 volunteer translators across the globe – from school students to retired academics – to translate these previously unseen stories. Written by Chekhov between the ages of 20 and 22, they are full of experimental wordplay, nonsense names and onomatopoeiac idiocy, from the village of Eaten-Pancakes (“Bliny-S’edeny”) in the opening story, Letter to a Learned Neighbour, to railway stations called Crash, Bang, Wallop, Run for Your Life and Swindler Town in On the Train, and a character called Second Lieutenant Zyumbumbunchikov in Before the Wedding (it means nothing, but say it aloud and it’s genius). These 58 stories, written under numerous pseudonyms, are little known, even among experts, says Bartlett. “Chekhov is better known as a writer of stories in Russia than of plays, and these stories remind us that he began as a humorist,” she says. “Not all of them are funny, or even intended to make us laugh, but a great many are totally frivolous – as one would expect from a 20-year-old medical student just trying to earn a few kopecks writing for comic journals.” Chekhov’s father had recently been declared bankrupt, so he was paying for his own education while also supporting the rest of his family. He wanted to conserve his real name for publication in respected scientific journals. Within a few years, however, it had become evident that – whether he liked it or not – he was a writer and his writing was worth taking seriously. By the mid 1880s, he had formulated the now legendary idea that medicine would be his “lawful wedded wife” and writing his mistress. (“When I’ve had enough of one, I can go and spend the night with the other.”) Chekhov was never a fan of his own work, whether prose or plays. He was modest about even his most famous and beloved short stories The Lady With the Dog (about a love affair in Yalta), Ward No 6 (about a doctor who is sick of his profession) and The Darling (about a woman who is ludicrously co-dependent, long before the term was invented). After a disastrous first outing of The Seagull in 1896 he was so mortified that he fled the theatre: “I shall never either write plays or have them acted.” (The play was staged by Konstantin Stanislavski in 1898 to great acclaim.) In 1888, he wrote to his editor that he doubted any of his stories would “survive in people’s memory for even a decade”. His doubts never made him less prolific. In 1884 alone – the year he graduated as a doctor – he published more than 100 stories. By the time he died in 1904 of tuberculosis at the age of 44, that number had climbed to more than 500. This collection is published at a fragile cultural moment. Ukrainian writers including Oksana Zabuzhko, Olesya Khromeychuk and Oleksandr Mykhed have argued for a critical re-evaluation of Russian literature – and for more space for Ukrainian voices and culture. “The revulsion many Ukrainians feel now for Russian literature due to the war is understandable,” says Bartlett. “But even those who repudiate it often make an exception for Chekhov, for good reason.” Crucially, Chekhov does not belong to Putin’s Russia, she says. “He was never an imperialist, he couldn’t stand the jingoism of a writer like Dostoevsky, and the country is not littered with statues of him. Chekhov was a quarter Ukrainian himself, and grew up in Taganrog, a town historically part of Ukraine. During his childhood he and his brothers used to stage amateur productions of plays in Ukrainian – the language was part of his birthright. Chekhov occasionally used Ukrainian sayings, and we have highlighted them and explained their meaning in the annotations.” Bartlett suggests that it shouldn’t be a case of reading “either/or”: “Increasing our familiarity with Ukrainian writers should not have to exclude the possibility of discovering new works by Chekhov. We need to keep reading, and read more.” Zyumbumbunchikov can’t be a bad place to start. • Anton Chekhov: Earliest Stories: Stories, Novellas, Humoresques, 1880–1882, edited by Rosamund Bartlett and Elena Michajlowska, is published by Cherry Orchard."

The musician died in January aged 78, leaving behind a cache of fascinating portraits, photographs and ephemera from a glamorous, sometimes troubled life. “Each piece tells a story and reflects her spirit and inimitable taste,” her son Nicholas Dunbar said. “It is time now for these belongings to find new homes and I hope that they will bring as much joy to their new owners as they did Marianne.” The diaries include one from 1959 when Faithfull was in her early teens, and a 1989 journal entitled Goals. Artworks include a print by South African artist Marlene Dumas with the inscription “Say it in Broken English”, a reference to one of Faithfull’s most iconic lyrics; Babylon, a work on paper by Anita Pallenberg, who was in Faithfull’s social circle alongside the Rolling Stones; and Abductee, a collage by Australian pop artist Martin Sharp. Furniture from the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries is up for sale, along with items from Faithfull’s wardrobe, including a Louis Vuitton by Marc Jacobs black wool coat. A trunk belonging to Fisher and gifted to Faithfull is expected to sell for between £1,000 and £1,500. The singer and actor were “very, very close” according to the singer Rufus Wainwright, who paid tribute to Faithfull in the Guardian after her death. “I had several wild evenings seated between them, kind of along for the ride. They were completely classic, original legends, who seemed to live in a universe all their own, and it was very decadent, incredibly funny and totally rock’n’roll.” Faithfull became an icon of swinging-60s London, with pop hits including As Tears Go By and an acting career with roles opposite the likes of Orson Welles and Alain Delon. She was a muse to the Rolling Stones and co-wrote the song Sister Morphine, which she recorded and was covered by the Stones on Sticky Fingers. But she became addicted to cocaine and heroin, and spent some years homeless in London, before getting clean in the 1980s and rebuilding her music career, going on to record with artists including Nick Cave, Damon Albarn and Metallica. The auction items are on view at Bonham’s in Knightsbridge as part of their Sound &amp; Cinema auction, which will run until 3 December. The auction house’s pop culture specialist Rebecca Anthony heralded Faithfull as “a cultural icon with an exceptional sense of style and lasting legacy, we are delighted to bring items from her personal collection to auction for the first time”."

At the time the 42-year-old said he was dealing with an “ailment” after performing in New Orleans and had gone to a hospital in Houston, where he discovered he needed surgery. He subsequently postponed, then entirely cancelled the remainder of his US tour, as well as all of his UK, European and Australian dates, writing: “Unfortunately, my path to recovery is taking longer than expected.” While performing at Tyler, the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw festival in Los Angeles on Saturday night, Glover told the audience that he’d had a stroke. “I was doing this world tour,” he said. “I was having lots of fun, really loving seeing you guys out there. “I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana and I did the show anyway. I couldn’t really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke.’ “And the first thing I thought was like, ‘Oh, here I am still copying Jamie Foxx,’” he joked, referring to Foxx’s stroke in 2023. “That’s really like the second thing. The first thing was like, ‘I’m letting everybody down.’ I know it’s not true.” Glover also revealed that he had broken one of his feet, then doctors found a hole in his heart, which required him to undergo surgery twice. “They say everybody has two lives and the second life starts when you realise you have one,” Glover said. “You got one life, guys, and I gotta be honest, the life I’ve lived with you guys has been such a blessing.” Glover, who has won five Grammy awards, has retired his Childish Gambino stage name after releasing his final album, Bando Stone &amp; the New World. The tour was to be his farewell to Childish Gambino."

The 57-year-old flew from Arizona to appear at Westminster magistrates court in person on Tuesday, where the judgment was delivered. Linehan denied harassing Sophia Brooks on social media between 11 and 27 October 2024, and a charge of criminal damage of their mobile phone on 19 October last year outside the Battle of Ideas conference in Westminster. Judge Clarke fined Linehan £500 and ordered him to pay costs of £650 and a statutory surcharge of £200. Linehan’s lawyer, Sarah Vine KC, asked that he be given 28 days to pay the full amount. The trial heard that Brooks had begun taking photographs of delegates at the event during a speech by Fiona McAnena, the director of campaigns at Sex Matters, a UK gender-critical campaign group. Outside the event, the activist asked Linehan: “Why do you think it is acceptable to call teenagers domestic terrorists?” In response, the court heard that Linehan had called Brooks a “sissy porn-watching scumbag”, a “groomer” and a “disgusting incel”, with the complainant responding: “You’re the incel, you’re divorced.” The judge found that Linehan had taken Brooks’s phone because he was “angry and fed up”, and had damaged it by knocking it to the ground. She said that while the offence was not aggravated by the fact the complainant was transgender, it was because they were 17 years old at the time. She ruled that she was “not sure to the criminal standard” that Linehan had demonstrated hostility based on the complainant being transgender. She added that she did not find the complainant “was as alarmed or distressed” as they had portrayed themself. The prosecutor Julia Faure Walker told the court that Linehan had written “repeated, abusive, unreasonable” social media posts about Brooks, whom he referred to as Tarquin. Vine said: “The background of this case involves what I would describe as provocative conduct by the complainant, and the raising of allegations in the service of, broadly speaking, political point-scoring.” She added that the costs to Linehan had “been enormous”, and resulted from a “momentary lapse of control” which led to behaviour that “could not be described as beyond reproach”. The comedy writer, who has well-publicised strong views on gender issues, said his “life was made hell” by trans activists, adding that the complainant was a “young soldier in the trans activist army”. The writer added: “He was misogynistic, he was abusive, he was snide. He depended on his anonymity to get close to people and hurt them, and I wanted to destroy that anonymity.” He told journalists outside the court that he hoped the not guilty verdict would mean that “people in the future won’t be subject to those kind of tactics”."
culture_2025_nov_25_moving-an-elegant-portrait-of-90s-japan-through-tweenage-eyes.txt,culture,2025-11-25,Đăng Tùng Bạch,Moving: an elegant portrait of 90s Japan through tweenage eyes,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/25/moving-an-elegant-portrait-of-90s-japan-through-tweenage-eyes,"During a science class, 12-year-old Renko Urushiba (Tomoko Tabata) is confronted by her classmates for befriending Tachibana (Nagiko Tono), a girl from Tokyo who is shunned for having divorced parents. Refusing to give up her friendship, Renko hurls a laboratory burner on to her desk, setting it ablaze and throwing the class into chaos. Unbeknown to most of her friends, Renko’s parents are separated, too. Equal parts perceptive and mischievous, little Renko is the protagonist of 1993’s Moving, the acclaimed 10th feature by the Japanese auteur Shinji Sōmai. Attuned to the sensibilities of childhood, Moving delicately traces the uncertainties that line the thorny path towards adolescence. With Sōmai’s signature long takes and elaborate camera movements, the film tries to keep up with Renko’s hurried footsteps as she dashes between her discordant parents. Renko’s father, Kenichi (Kiichi Nakai), is gentle but ineffectual. Although his moments with Renko are playful, Kenichi’s vacant gazes convey a deeper weariness. On the other hand, Renko’s mother, Nazuna (Junko Sakurada), is fiercely assertive. After her split from Kenichi, Nazuna throws herself into the task of reinventing life for her and her daughter. However, her fervent resolve to restore order makes her affection for Renko harden into impatience and control. Caught in the downpours of Kyoto’s summer, Renko stirs up a typhoon herself in hopes that her separated parents will reunite. Renko runs, she lashes out and, at times, she quietly observes her sense of normalcy crumble away. In one scene, she locks herself in a bathroom at home and forces her parents to confront one another. When a heated argument erupts, Renko glimpses in them a tempest she has never known. As Kenichi and Nazuna sink into a wounded silence, Renko’s world of innocence shatters. Nevertheless, she remains undeterred. Oscillating between sowing havoc in domestic spaces and speeding through urban landscapes, Renko keeps up her earnest yet painful attempts at reconnecting her parents. As the camera drifts across rooms and streets to follow Renko, the film’s 90s backdrop is brought to the fore. Referred to as Japan’s “lost decade”, the period saw the country’s economic bubble burst, plunging a previously forward-looking society into stagnation. In the breakup of Renko’s parents, you might sense the nation’s loss of faith in the nuclear family and the economic system that once sustained it. Kyoto’s summer festivals, too, are woven into the film. With this recurring motif, Sōmai elegantly links the growing tensions of the Urushiba household with a collective sense of spirituality, which adds a mythological dimension to the film’s domestic realism. When Nazuna finds Renko missing from home, she hears the faint drums and bells of Japan’s famous Gion festival, whose festivities only weigh on her loneliness. Similarly, as Kenichi takes Renko home on his motorcycle, the Kanji character “大” (“great”) burns on a faraway mountainside: part of a bonfire rite to farewell ancestral spirits. Through long handheld shots, Sōmai tethers the fragility of the father-daughter bond and the melancholy of the flames. As Renko attempts one final ploy to bring her parents together, she runs away and disappears into a local festival by Lake Biwa. Bundles of burning hay and blazing torches cast an amber glow into the night: hypnotic and meditative, carrying fleeting sparks that guide Renko on her personal rite of passage. Finding herself suspended between a past she can no longer hold on to and a future full of doubts, Renko gradually stops running. At last, the film slows down with her. As dawn breaks, ripples glisten in the half-light, carrying Renko slowly away from her childhood, away from a world she has grown disillusioned with.

culture_2025_nov_25_seth-meyers-on-trump-mamdani-meeting.txt,culture,2025-11-25,Guardian staff,Seth Meyers on Trump’s meeting with Mamdani: ‘I’ve never seen Trump this smitten before’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/25/seth-meyers-on-trump-mamdani-meeting,"Late-night hosts discussed Donald Trump’s strangely friendly meeting with New York’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Seth Meyers Seth Meyers devoted his Monday Closer Look segment to the bizarrely friendly White House meeting between Donald Trump and New York’s mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, where the president seemed downright pleased to be meeting the Democratic socialist that his administration has long demonized. “He looks like a five-year-old meeting Mickey Mouse,” said an amused Meyers. Though Trump had previously called Mamdani a “communist” and a “total nutjob” the president seemed charmed by the 34-year-old mayor. “I’ve never seen Trump this smitten before,” the Late Night host said. “This is a reminder: he doesn’t work with a single cool person! He is surrounded by so many charmless goons that the first time he got to hang out with someone that had a little charisma, he swooned like he was on a date with the varsity quarterback. “You’d have stars in your eyes too if you spent every day of your life with joyless gargoyles like Stephen Miller and JD Vance, and then you met a 34-year-old social media star who rapped in a halal cart and once appeared in an actual Disney movie,” he added. Meyers then trained on arguably the most surprising moment of the Oval Office meeting: when Trump interjected as Mamdani was asked about previously calling the president a fascist. “That’s OK, you can just say, ‘Yes.’ OK? It’s easier – it’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind,” Trump said while patting Mamdani on the arm. “That is the flirtiest I’ve ever heard anyone say, ‘You can call me a fascist,’” Meyers joked, before breaking out his Trump impression: “You can call me a fascist, you can call me – I’ll be whatever you want me to be!” “Of course, it won’t be remotely surprising if Trump changes his tune,” he concluded. “We’ve seen it happen many times before. But the one takeaway that will last is that all the Maga scare tactics evaporated. The right thought meeting Trump would be Zohran’s worst nightmare, but it turns out meeting Zohran was Trump’s dream come true.” Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel celebrated his frequent target Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation from Congress, after a falling-out with Trump. “Yet another Trump superfan learns that loyalty to him goes only one way,” he laughed. In a message to her constituents, Greene said she found that Congress was beholden to the supremely wealthy and ignores the needs of ordinary Americans. “She says her party has no plan for healthcare, and that the Jeffrey Epstein files are not a hoax that the president claims they are – to which I say, welcome to reality, Marge,” said Kimmel. “We’re glad to have you here. Make yourself at home, and feel free to check out our science wing while you have a chance. “Marjorie is out and Mamdani is in,” he added, referring to Trump’s “highly unlikely Friendsgiving on Friday at the White House” with Mamdani. “Most people were expecting fireworks,” he said, “but they did not expect them to be the Katy Perry kind.” “They have the vibe of a wealthy elderly gay man at the Cheesecake Factory ordering his shy young boyfriend dessert,” Kimmel said of the chummy affair. Trump, to Kimmel’s shock, lavished Mamdani with praise, saying, among other things: “He really ran an incredible race, and I congratulated him,” “it’s an amazing thing that he did,” “I think you’re going to have hopefully a really great mayor, and the better he does, the happier I am” and “I feel very confident that he’s going to do a great job.” “What a turn of events!” Kimmel exclaimed. “It was like he was giving a wedding toast to his new son-in-law. It’s almost as if, and I know this sounds crazy – it’s almost as if Trump doesn’t have any real political convictions at all. He just says whatever, whenever.” Of Trump’s physical displays of affection for the young mayor, Kimmel added: “He touched him more in that press conference that he’s touched Melania all year.” The unlikely alliance left heads spinning in Maga world. “They had to unplug and reboot Sean Hannity five times after this,” Kimmel chuckled. “This is how upside-down this crop of Maga-teers is: they’re mad at Trump, some of them are furious at Trump, because he was friendly with the new mayor of New York. Last week, he had a big celebratory dinner for the Saudi prince whose goons dismembered a columnist for the Washington Post? No problem. This? Too much. “Anybody who’s surprised that Trump got along with Mamdani should not be surprised,” he concluded. “Trump loves when famous people come to visit.”"

Jimmy Kimmel On his final show before the Thanksgiving holiday, Jimmy Kimmel counted his blessings. “This year, I am most thankful that we only have five weeks left in this year,” he joked on Tuesday evening. Meanwhile at the White House “the presidential ketchup boat is filled to the brim and ready to go.” On Tuesday, at the “freshly paved over Rose Garden”, the president presided over the annual pardon of the turkeys, “which at this point are the only thing that Trump hasn’t pardoned this year”. The two lucky birds this year are named Gobble and Waddle, “which is what Trump does every night at dinner”, Kimmel quipped. “Now most presidents at the turkey pardon keep it light – they do bad puns, they wish everybody a happy Thanksgiving, and they go back to work,” he continued. “But that’s not Donald Trump. Donald Trump used the opportunity to brag about all the wars he’s ending, how low his imaginary prices are now. “And out of nowhere, took shots at the mayor of Chicago and the governor of Illinois,” calling them, respectively, a “low-IQ person” and a “big fat slob”. “Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!” Kimmel deadpanned. “I mean, seriously though – he says a lot of crazy stuff. In that same press conference he said there had been no murders in Washington DC in the last six months because of him,” even though, in reality, there have been 62 murders in Washington since he took office. “Which already indicates a vivid imagination,” said Kimmel. “But does he really look at himself in the mirror and go: ‘I am thin. I am so thin I can comment on others who aren’t?’” Kimmel also touched on the news that Paramount, now owned by Trump’s friend Larry Ellison, will distribute a new Rush Hour movie at Trump’s request. “He likes the Rush Hour movies because that was the last time he got Eric to be quiet for 90 minutes,” Kimmel joked. The fourth Rush Hour movie had been dead in the water until Trump intervened, because director Bret Ratner had been blacklisted in Hollywood over sexual misconduct allegations, though he is making a theatrical comeback, of sorts, with a documentary on Melania Trump. “One thing about Melania – she has really good instincts about men,” Kimmel joked. “So for anyone who says that Trump wastes a lot of time on nothing, wrong! We’re getting a Rush Hour 4. And next up, The Cosby Show.” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers recapped an especially strange edition of the annual turkey pardon. “No matter who the president is, this is a weird tradition,” he noted. “But, as weird as it is, Trump can always make it weirder.” Meyers played a montage of clips from Trump’s address, in which he claimed last year’s turkey pardons were invalid and rambled about “gang members”, “murders” and called the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, a “big, fat slob”. “I think those turkeys were standing there being like, ‘Just fucking kill us. Put us out of our misery,’” Meyers joked. And yet somehow, it “did get weirder”, as Trump went on to say that the secretary of health and human services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, had deemed Gobble and Waddle as the first “Maha” (Make America Healthy Again) turkeys, raised on a diet of grass and beef smoothies. “It definitely sounds like you still plan on eating them,” Meyers quipped, imitating Trump: “We’ve fattened them up for this pardon. And then, of course, the next step, we will baste them for justice.”"

Now Riches is back with another leftfield celebrity riff as he gives his Game of Thrones-era Sean Bean impression (as seen on 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown and his Edinburgh show Dungeons’n’Bastards) a yuletide twist. Rachel Aroesti The BFG Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, to 7 February Are you ready for snozzcumbers and dream-catchers, for norphans and whizzpoppers? A stellar team have come together for this world premiere of Roald Dahl’s children’s classic, with a script courtesy of Tom Wells (Jumpers for Goalposts) and puppetry by the masterful Toby Olié (Spirited Away). John Leader heads up the cast for this beloved story of an orphan befriending a giant; Daniel Evans directs. Kate Wyver Count Arthur Strong Is Charles Dickens in A Christmas Carol Touring to 14 December The reliably bewildered and chronically digressive one-time variety star takes his tangent-riddled festive show on tour again. As Strong (Steve Delaney) resumes the role of the Victorian author for an unwieldy performance of his classic Christmas novel, prepare for terrible tricks, awkwardly repurposed props and a persistent bassline of chaotic confusion. RA Ebony Scrooge Sadler’s Wells East, London, to 4 January A brand new Christmas show from ZooNation, the company known for its hip-hop rewrites of classic titles. This one puts a new (head)spin on Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, with Scrooge as a formidable fashion label boss who needs to learn some lessons about the true meaning of happiness. A feelgood, family-friendly show. Lindsey Winship The Little Mermaid The Watermill theatre, Newbury, to 4 January Hans Christian Andersen’s classic fairytale is transported to a magical realm far beyond the Cornish coast in Lara Barbier’s new musical adaptation. With original music and lyrics by Amie Parsons, one half of Cornish folk duo True Foxes, folk stories weave their way into this ethereal, sea-salty world for families, where the Landfolk’s song lures the daughter of the Sea King. KW A Merry Misrule Battersea Arts Centre, London, 29 November to Christmas Eve Immersive magic-makers Wild Rumpus return for another takeover of Battersea Arts Centre, great news for anyone who experienced the heart-soaring feeling of seeing their illuminated wolf puppet several years ago in Solstice. This year’s enchanting family adventure sets wanderers in the midst of chaos as yuletide traditions run riot, with the task of bringing harmony back for Christmas. KW Beauty and the Beast Citizens theatre, Glasgow, 2 December to New Year’s Eve After seven years, Glasgow’s Citizens theatre reopened its doors this autumn. Now it welcomes audiences back for the Christmas season with Lewis Hetherington’s (Red Riding Hood) bold adaptation of Beauty and the Beast. Mischief is in the air for this family show that champions being kind and being yourself, with live music composed by Nikola Kodjabashia. KW The Magic Flute DanceEast, Ipswich, 12 to 14 December; The Place, London, 17 December to Christmas Eve Luca Silvestrini’s Protein Dance charmed audiences with its last family show, The Little Prince. You can expect it to do the same with the UK premiere of Silvestrini’s new show, The Magic Flute. It’s a playful combo of storytelling, singing and dancing based on Mozart’s opera, with an emphasis on themes of love and friendship. Age 5+. LW Film Zootropolis 2 Out now Christmas wouldn’t quite be Christmas without a big, bright family animation. Foxy police officer Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) and cute as a button bunny cop Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) tackle their latest assignment: investigate new player in town Gary De’Snake (Ke Huy Quan). This instalment also introduces a family of lynxes including runt-of-the-litter Pawbert (Andy Samberg) and business leader Milton (David Strathairn). The Shining Out 12 December Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) has been employed as winter caretaker to the ill-omened Overlook Hotel, and he’s brought his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) along for the ride. That makes Stanley Kubrick’s horror – rereleased for its 45th anniversary – a contender for a festive film in our book: it’s got plenty of snow, seasonally green foliage, cosy knitwear and a big knife fit to carve even the fattest of turkeys. Silent Night, Deadly Night Out 12 December You better watch out, you better not cry, you better not pout, I’m telling you why: Billy (Rohan Campbell) the seasonal killing spree maniac is coming to town. Per Billy’s traumatic backstory as established in the gritty 1984 original, Christmas is a time for stabbing and shivving, while wearing a holly jolly Santa outfit. Avatar: Fire and Ash Out 19 December Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, Kate Winslet: the gang’s all here for the third instalment of James Cameron’s epic yarn, detailing the various conflicts between humans and the Na’vi. The philosophy of these films is very much one of goodwill to all people/Na’vi kind. Cameron’s work might have been more fun when he was creating Terminators, but that would be an uncharitable thought in the season of peace on Earth. Marty Supreme Out Boxing Day Directed by the Josh half of the Safdie brothers, this sports comedy is (very) loosely inspired by Marty Reisman, the New York ping pong player known as “the Needle” for his slight stature, quick play and even quicker wit. Timothée Chalamet stars as Marty, setting Oscar buzz a-buzzing for his flamboyant, zesty performance. With support from Gwyneth Paltrow, Abel Ferrara and Fran Drescher. The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants Out Boxing Day Who even needs a present under the tree when the fourth SpongeBob feature film is here. This time, the amiable yellow tube sponge is on a quest to find the Flying Dutchman (voiced by Mark Hamill), the ghost ship of legend, here found haunting the seven seas because his corpse was used as a window display. Catherine Bray Art Marie Antoinette Style V&amp;A South Kensington, London, to 22 March Fairytale frocks and fantastical jewels, haunting paintings and porcelain make this a magical show for the holiday season. The 18th-century queen Marie Antoinette lived like a Disney princess, as surviving examples of her clothes and necklaces show, but her dream existence came to a cruel end in the French Revolution. Not many exhibitions include both a photograph of Kate Moss done up in ancien régime style, and the actual guillotine that may have beheaded Marie Antoinette. Space: Could Life Exist Beyond Earth? Natural History Museum, London, to 22 February Astronomy always feels part of Christmas, possibly because of the story of the Magi following a star, or just the night skies of midwinter – and this is a good holiday exhibition for all ages. Interactive displays with levers, buttons and spinning planets add to the fun as you follow the paths of life-seeking robot spacecraft to the limits of our solar system, then look farther at the discoveries of Earth-like exoplanets orbiting distant stars. Turner: Always Contemporary Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, to 22 February Winter’s winds and rains are reflected majestically in JMW Turner’s paintings. No artist is better suited to the year’s darkest days. But if that sounds too brooding for Christmas his influence gets a fun twist here, with a Damien Hirst pickled shark among the contemporary works mixed with his masterpieces. Turner had a huge impact on the first modernists, as a work by Monet shows. He still seems contemporary because his art is so restless. William Kentridge Yorkshire Sculpture Park, nr Wakefield, to 19 April If you need something to wake you up after days of mince pies and turkey, the fresh air of Yorkshire Sculpture Park and its excellent show by South Africa’s great William Kentridge may do the trick. The films are the most mind-boggling things in this mini retrospective, from a hilarious, eerie animated history of the Russian Revolution to the artist having a long argument with his double about what really happened in his own life. Jonathan Jones Music D-Block Europe to 19 December Young Adz and Dirtbike LB, AKA south London’s Brit-nominated rap duo D-Block Europe, continue their upwards trajectory – across their various albums and mixtapes they’ve scored eight Top 10 albums – on this mammoth arena tour. Having collaborated with everyone from Ed Sheeran to Burna Boy via Raye, a guest appearance or two shouldn’t be out of the question. Michael Cragg Wolf Alice 2; touring to 10 December Across four critically lauded albums, London quartet Wolf Alice have steadily blossomed from spectral indie rockers into full-blown arena pop-rock superstars. While August’s Greg Kurstin-assisted The Clearing will likely make a bit more sense come next summer’s festivals, for now let its 70s-indebted feel warm the winter gloom. MC BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra 90th Birthday Concert City Halls, Glasgow, 4 December The BBC SSO turns 90 this month. This celebration concert with chief conductor Ryan Wigglesworth starts in wild style with a new Bacchanale from the uncategorisable composer Ayanna Witter-Johnson. Stephen Hough takes centre stage in Grieg’s warhorse Piano Concerto; Tippett’s oratorio A Child of Our Time will harness the energy of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and a fine quartet of soloists led by Pumeza Matshikiza. Erica Jeal Kylie Minogue – Kylie Christmas (Fully Wrapped) Out 5 December The Christmas fairy to Mariah’s snow queen celebrates the 10-year anniversary of her festive opus, Kylie Christmas, by cherrypicking the best of the original album and chucking on four new songs. One of them, the camptastic single Xmas, is a riot of twinkling bells, cheerleader pep and a bucket load of office party fizz. MC RnB Xmas Ball 2025 7 to 14 December; tour starts London The annual R&amp;B nostalgia fest returns with another top-notch lineup featuring He Wasn’t Man Enough hitmaker Toni Braxton, ballad belters Boyz II Men, gyrating Lotharios Dru Hill (fronted by thong fanatic Sisqó) and smooth soul crooner Joe. End of the Road, Un-Break My Heart, How Deep Is Your Love; you can’t go wrong! MC Ariodante Royal Opera House, London, 9 to 21 December Ariodante is one of Handel’s great operas and includes some of his most deeply felt arias. Jetske Mijnssen, who made a big impression with Glyndebourne’s first Parsifal this summer, makes her Covent Garden debut with a new production. Stefano Montanari conducts a cast led by two rising stars: the Canadian mezzo-soprano Emily D’Angelo in the title role and the US soprano Jacquelyn Stucker as his beloved Ginevra. EJ Guy Barker’s Big Band Christmas Royal Albert Hall, London, 17 December Seasonal title reference notwithstanding, this Royal Albert Hall annual event is a long way from the turkey musical hardliners might assume, because the remarkable artist programming it knows creative jazz-making inside out. Leader Guy Barker pulls together new arrangements of classic songs and reinventions of recent ones, with a cracking big band and classy star guests. John Fordham Percy Pursglove/Trinity Laban Jazz Orchestra Vortex Jazz Club, London, 18 December One of European jazz and improvised music’s most versatile instrumentalists, and moreover a choral and orchestral composer, Percy Pursglove emerged a decade ago as a brilliant genre-fluid trumpeter, and a comparably adventurous big-band writer. The excellent Trinity Laban Jazz Orchestra back his soaring trumpet lines here on his own composition for Hamburg’s famous NDR Bigband. JF"
culture_2025_nov_28_dont-panic-revisiting-the-millenniums-wildest-cultural-predictions.txt,culture,2025-11-29,Gwilym Mumford,​The Guide #219: Don’t panic! Revisiting the millennium’s wildest cultural predictions,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/28/dont-panic-revisiting-the-millenniums-wildest-cultural-predictions,"I love revisiting articles from around the turn of the millennium, a fascinatingly febrile period when everyone – but journalists especially – briefly lost the run of themselves. It seems strange now to think that the ticking over of a clock from 23:59 to 00:00 would prompt such big feelings, of excitement, terror, of end-of-days abandon, but it really did (I can remember feeling them myself as a teenager, especially the end-of-days-abandon bit.) Of course, some of that feeling came from the ticking over of the clock itself: the fears over the Y2K bug might seem quite silly today, but its potential ramifications – planes falling out of the sky, power grids failing, entire life savings being deleted in a stroke – would have sent anyone a bit loopy. There’s a very good podcast, Surviving Y2K, about some of the people who responded particularly drastically to the bug’s threat, including a bloke who planned to sit out the apocalypse by farming and eating hamsters. It does seem funny – and fitting – in the UK, column inches about this existential threat were equalled, perhaps even outmatched, by those about a big tarpaulin in Greenwich. Honestly, it’s staggering how animated so many people were by the Millennium Dome: I get that it was a colossal New Labour white elephant, but did it really merit such breathless, teeth-gnashing coverage? (Click a few pages into the Guardian’s millennium tag for a sense of the collective mania at the time.) Especially when you consider that its eventual fate, rather than being razed to the ground or shot into space, was to be turned into a successful, if soulless, entertainment venue. Alongside worrying about the Dome, and the small matter of the world ending, the millennium offered a rare opportunity for grand reflection – on the thousand years of history just gone – and wild prognostication on every possible topic: politics, religion, sport, technology and, of course, culture. Looking back at past predictions and pointing out how wrong they were is a pretty cheap sport, like shooting Mystic Megs in a barrel. But given that, earlier this year, we looked at how music, film and TV had changed over the past 25 years, it seems instructive to see what people thought those next 25 years and beyond would look like. And what’s fascinating is how close, but also how far away, predictions of the future of those forms were. Take film. Around the turn of the millennium, the major disrupting force in cinema was the arrival of digital projectors, which it was confidently predicted, would end the century-old use of celluloid. There were countless articles fretting about the ramifications of this shift, both aesthetically and in a business sense and, in a way, those articles were right to be concerned: by the mid 2010s, 90% of movies were shot digitally rather than on film. They did, though, rather miss the wood for the trees: the streaming revolution and struggles faced by cinemas would make the digital/film face-off look a minuscule issue by comparison. And, anyway, plenty of directors have made it their mission to keep the film flame alive – see Brady Corbet dragging his hefty 70mm canisters into Venice to premiere The Brutalist (pictured above). At the turn of the millennium, the TV industry was worried about a gamechanging innovation too: personal video recorders (PVRs) like TiVo, which they feared would completely destroy the ad market by allowing audiences to record shows and whiz through commercials. They were a big enough deal for author Michael Lewis, of Moneyball and The Big Short fame, to devote several thousand words to the subject in the New York Times. Of course those recorders were merely a stop on the journey towards total on-demand TV offered by Netflix et al, but some smart people were already aware of the direction of travel, like one director of a PVR company who was quoted in a Guardian feature on the trend. “Television schedules will shift from a time-based paradigm to one based purely on content,” he predicted. “People will operate channels according to their own interests. It will have a dramatic effect on those general channels which are ad funded. Maybe this is the end for scheduling.” More than any other cultural medium, the music industry was already vaguely aware of the changes it was facing – this despite the fact that 2000 would become the most successful ever year for CD sales. In the autumn of 1999, the Observer asked a panel of musicians, label staff and DJs for their predictions, and there were some impressively accurate calls on where music was heading – Parlophone A&amp;R Keith Wozencroft noted the possibility of making an album from your bedroom, and a decade before Boiler Room, Paul Oakenfold said that he was already doing live shows online. Pete Waterman’s crystal ball must have been fogging over when he predicted that people would start buying their music “not via the Internet, as most people think, but digital TV – the digital shopping services will blossom in the next five years”. But he was on the money in his claim that “music markets worldwide will converge”, citing the success of Ricky Martin as evidence for a global appetite for Latin pop, an appetite that, as proved by the likes of Bad Bunny, is just as strong today. Of course a whopping great cultural innovation on the horizon that was completely missed by all the prognosticators was podcasts: the term would be coined only a few years later (in the pages of the Guardian, I’m contractually obliged to remind you). And there’s no mention in any of the turn-of-the-millennium predictions of what will possibly be the biggest change of all for culture this century and beyond: artificial intelligence. That’s a wave that is still breaking, and no doubt plenty of the predictions being made about its impact on film, TV and music will be wrong (I’m less than convinced by the idea that we’ll use AI to star in our own movies alongside Marilyn Monroe, for example). And of course, in 25 years there will be people writing about how way off the predictions made today turned out to be – well, if we’re not in a post-apocalyptic wasteland eating hamster meat by then.

culture_2025_nov_28_oh-yes-he-is-kiefer-sutherland-dives-into-the-world-of-panto-tinsel-town.txt,culture,2025-11-28,Hollie Richardson,Oh yes he is! Kiefer Sutherland dives into the world of panto,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/28/oh-yes-he-is-kiefer-sutherland-dives-into-the-world-of-panto-tinsel-town,"Twenty-odd years ago, I binged a TV series on DVD for the first time. At my mate’s house in a village outside Harrogate, I was glued to Jack Bauer shooting his way through 24. We probably only made it to episode six before surrendering to sleep for school the next day. Fast forward to the start of this year, and photos are all over the local news of Kiefer Sutherland out and about in nearby market towns Knaresborough and Wetherby. The real Jack Bauer in Yorkshire! He and Rebel Wilson are in the area making Tinsel Town, a British Christmas film about pantomimes. By March, I am invited to a Leeds studio, where they are filming, and find Sutherland dressed as Buttons on a stage. His glittery eyeshadow shimmers as he smiles and dances to Katy Perry’s Roar with the Cinderella cast. He repeats this showstopper scene about 15 times. It’s a surreal full circle moment; I half expect him to pull a pistol out on the ugly stepsisters. Sutherland is in Paris when I explain the connection later. “That’s very funny,” the Canadian laughs down the phone. “I ended up loving it; Leeds is a fantastic city.” Locals might have spotted him on weekend walks around the university, or at the pub he filmed in. “They had regular customers in, and they were just being really nice.” He also continued his obsession with Greggs sausage rolls, which started on tour with his band – “it was like the heavens had opened up” – and arranged for the bakers’ van to visit the set. Does he have a gold card? “I did for one tour. It was great, but I didn’t use it. I could afford my own sausage roll and a Steak Bake!” Tinsel Town is a feelgood family comedy, directed by Chris Foggin (Bank of Dave, Fisherman’s Friends). Sutherland gamely leans into a meta role for it: Bradley Mack, a washed up Hollywood action star who thinks a stint in the West End will save his career. Except, when he arrives in England, he realises his stage debut will be in a small theatre production of Cinderella in a northern town called Stoneford. “It’s funny to watch his descent into actor hell,” says Sutherland. But it’s moving, too, as Bradley realises he needs to get himself together for his semi-estranged daughter. “It’s a lesson to a lot of parents out there who might actually be the children in that relationship. Certainly there were times where I could definitely say the same thing about myself.” Ultimately, though, this is a very sweet call to arms to save pantomime – and a “booo!” to anyone who sneers at it. The ensemble boasts stage icons such as Derek Jacobi and Meera Syal. “My first glimpse of theatre was attending panto at a little church group – there was nothing else to do in the village I grew up in,” says Syal, taking a breather in her trailer on set. “I’ll never forget the feeling of the lights going down, the music starting, the actors coming on.” She played Fairy Mermaid (“obviously”) in Birmingham Hippodrome’s production of Peter Pan in 2018. “Wearing a fishtail three times a day – you really had to work out the toilet breaks. It’s really hard work. But you get that joy of seeing kids absolutely spellbound. It’s very life-affirming.” Panto isn’t just about tradition – it keeps the arts financially afloat. “The revenue from those pantomimes keep those theatres going for the whole year,” says eight-time Olivier award nominee Maria Friedman. “I haven’t got enough time to tell you how dismayed I am about where the arts are – it’s just terrifying.” Friedman starred in Chicester Festivals’s 1982 production of Jack and the Beanstalk with “greats of comedy” Frankie Howerd and June Whitfield. In Tinsel Town she plays the fairy godmother. Her version of the classic panto goodie? “She loves a drink, she loves a joint, she’s permanently on heat. She really feels she’s in with a shot with Brad.” Rebel Wilson cheerily walks on set at the end of the day in a green jumpsuit, charming the crew around her. She plays choreographer Jill, who champions the performance from the stage wings. And yes, she attempts a Yorkshire accent. “The Yorkshire accent is hard,” Wilson admits to me later. “But I tried to do my best!” (Last year, she confessed: “I don’t think my Yorkshire accent is that great.”) Her favourite bit of dialect? “My classic Yorkshire line was, ‘Hiya luv!’”. She got into the local spirit by joining Sutherland in loving the local delicacies: “I can’t go past a Greggs sausage roll but I also like their doughnuts any time of the day.” Jill helps Bradley to embrace theatre life. “It was fantastic working with Rebel,” says Sutherland. “Obviously her comedic skills are world renowned but she also brought real heart to the film. I don’t want to speak for her, but I think it was exciting for her on that level.” As well as singing a lively Christmas number for the first time in a film (a good use of his country music success), Sutherland shares a schmaltzy waltz with Wilson: “It was a bit foreign for both of us but I think we had fun.” Wilson is no stranger to pantoland: “I have fun memories of seeing pantomimes in Australia when I was a kid. They were on at our local Returned and Services League club – my relatives fought in the wars. My mum also said that when I was two, she took me to my first pantomime in Sydney. They asked for volunteers from the audience and I ran up on stage and sang a song. She was shocked. I was normally so shy.” What was working with Hollywood stars in Yorkshire like for the rest of the British cast? By all accounts: lovely. “Kiefer actually told us about a great pie shop [in Wetherby],” says Ray Fearon, who plays the baron. “The funniest moment was a scene with Mawaan [Rizwan] driving a VW minibus,” adds Lucien Laviscount, who plays Prince Charming. “Kiefer was in the front seat – Mawaan hadn’t driven manual for a good few years and tried to get the car started. We’re all in stitches in the back and Kiefer’s just breathing down his neck saying, ‘More gas! More gas!’ He stalled it about eight times.” However, the best scene for viewers is undoubtedly the pathetic scrap between Sutherland and Danny Dyer, who plays Jill’s troubled hard-man ex. “Danny, I absolutely adore him,” says Sutherland. “He’s known as a tough guy in his films; I had 24 in my back pocket. It was just like, look, the way this is going to be funny is that these two guys really can’t fight very well at all. They’re the worst fighters on the planet but it ended up being one of my favourite fight sequences ever in my career.” It was a bizarre moment for Foggin to direct: “Everyone has to work with Danny Dyer: the love and enthusiasm he brings is just brilliant. Them two got on straight away. We filmed some scenes at [a] Wakefield theatre and in between rehearsals they would go off and fight with a stunt coordinator.” Foggin speaks from his Hertfordshire home over Zoom. After 2022’s This Is Christmas, Tinsel Town is the second festive film from the director, who was born in Sunderland and grew up in Durham. Is he the northern Richard Curtis? “He’s the reason I wanted to make movies. He’s a bit of an idol to me,” Foggin smiles. “When I think of Christmas, I think of Love Actually. I always wanted to make something – and who knows if this is going to be that film – like that: without looking at the TV listings, no matter what happens, Love Actually is always replayed at some point in the Christmas period, and the whole family still gets together to watch it.” Sutherland was the first choice, says Foggin, and he immediately got the assignment: “He’s got a lot of [British] sensibilities.” It makes sense: he was born in London and his grandparents were Scottish (his Falkirk-born politician grandfather, Tommy Douglas, went on to become the “father of universal healthcare” in Canada), which means he’s been back and forth all his life. Wilson, meanwhile, has spent a lot of time in the UK recently. Responding to reports that she has relocated to the Cotswolds, she says she remains rooted in LA. “My family and I love London,” she says. “I’ve been getting into UK TV shows like Slow Horses and Downton Abbey (yes, I know I’m a bit late) and the Celebrity Traitors.” But hold on. Sutherland’s transatlantic background makes an earlier revelation he made even more shocking: “I’ve never seen a pantomime. I was so bummed. We arrived in the first week of January. I dropped my bags off, went for a walk around town, and one of the first things I saw was a big poster for a pantomime. I got so excited: ‘Oh my gosh, I’m gonna go see the panto tonight!’ It was a big part of my research. Of course, it had closed the night before.” There’s always this year though, right? “That I will be able to do.” First though, it’s business as usual in Paris: “I’m about to go to a fight rehearsal for this film I’m doing.” Tinsel Town is on Sky Cinema from 5 December."
culture_2025_nov_28_susan-loppert-obituary.txt,culture,2025-11-28,Jane Caplan,Susan Loppert obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/28/susan-loppert-obituary,"My partner Susan Loppert, who has died aged 81, was the moving force behind the development of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Arts in the 1990s. This pioneering programme, which Susan directed for 10 years (1993-2003), was a hugely innovative and imaginative project to bring the visual and performing arts into the heart of London’s newest teaching hospital. As Susan wrote in an article for the Guardian in 2006, this was not about “the odd Monet reproduction or carols at Christmas … but 2,000 original works of art hung in the vast spaces of the stunning atrial building” as well as in clinics, wards and treatment areas – many of them specially commissioned. And on top of this, full-length operas, an annual music festival, Indian dancers in residence, and workshops by artists from poets to puppeteers. Susan was born in Grahamstown, South Africa, to Phyllis (nee Orkin, and known as “Inkey” because of her dark hair), a lawyer and anti-apartheid activist, and her husband Eric Loppert, a manager. She was brought up in the liberal Jewish community in Johannesburg, and although she became a staunch atheist she never lost her cultural connection to Judaism – hers was a Jewishness of the jokes and the food, as she put it. After studying English at the University of the Witwatersrand, she moved to London to start a postgraduate degree in the history of art at the Courtauld Institute, but she left before graduating, offended by the frivolity of its student culture compared with Wits. Her subsequent working life was self-made and variegated: not so much a linear career as a series of touchdowns in some of the 20th century’s most interesting cultural landing places. After a spell as editorial assistant at the Paris Review, she worked for Robert Fraser in his Mayfair gallery, standing in for him as director when he was jailed in the Rolling Stones trial in 1967 (Richard Hamilton dedicated his poster Swingeing London to Susan). In the 1970s and 80s she worked for Sotheby’s in London and in Cape Town, and as a freelance art dealer and consultant. In 1993 Susan became the first director of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Arts, propelling it into the vanguard of the emerging arts in hospital movement and earning herself an international reputation. She had spent a good deal of her life in hospital after contracting polio in childhood, which caused lifetime damage to her spine and lungs. This made her determined to break down the artificial walls that compressed the richness of life lived outside hospital into the one-dimensional identity of “patient”. She oversaw an ambitious and imaginative programme of art purchases and cultural activities, and raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to fund them – not a penny was charged to NHS budgets. Her work was recognised by a series of honours, including a European Women of Achievement award (2004), a Creative Britons award (2000) and a Londoner of the Year award (1998). Susan was a fearless activist and networker. Feisty, opinionated and demanding, she defended her vision and her artists like a lioness with her cubs. She is survived by me (her partner of 25 years), and by her brothers, Max and David."

Part eardrum assault and part history lesson, it’s unlikely to be boring. Michael Cragg Dirty Three 29 November to 8 December; tour starts Glasgow This week Warren Ellis, Mick Turner and Jim White, AKA Australian instrumental rock trio Dirty Three, tour the UK for the first time in 12 years. Mixing moments of transcendental beauty with big grotty rock, that intense fusion should soar in a live scenario. MC Liane Carroll Pizza Express Jazz Club, London, 3 to 5 December One of the most eloquent and inventive singer-pianists ever to have emerged from the UK jazz scene, Liane Carroll continues to charm and move listeners wherever she goes.

Howardena Pindell White Cube Bermondsey, London, to 18 January Beautiful and furious, the extraordinary art of Howardena Pindell ranges from abstract paintings with the freedom of Pollock and atmospherics of Monet to graphic denunciations of racism in the US. She paints and videos the history of her times, while her own long career bears witness to marginalisation, bravery and resilience. Stanley Spencer Gainsborough’s House, Sudbury, to 22 March The archaic visions of this 20th-century British artist stand as testaments to modern suffering and timeless hope.

My husband had become controlling, first with money, then with almost everything else: what I wore, who I saw, what I said. It crept up so slowly that I didn’t quite realise what was happening. We had met as students in the early 1970s, both from working-class, northern families and feeling slightly out of place at a university full of public school accents. We shared politics, music and a sense of being outsiders together. For years, life felt full of promise. When our first child arrived, I gave up my local government job to stay at home. That’s when the balance between us shifted. Because he earned the money, he began to see himself as the decision-maker. By the time we had our second son, what began as discussions turned into edicts. I remember once saying that one of the boys needed new shoes and him replying that we couldn’t afford them, only for him to spend the same amount on something for himself. Those small humiliations chipped away at my confidence until I barely recognised myself. I felt isolated, but I told myself it would be worse for the children if I left. Then one evening, about 15 years into our relationship, a friend suggested we go to the cinema. It felt like a rare escape. The film was Thelma &amp; Louise, which everyone was talking about. As soon as it started, I recognised Thelma’s husband – the blustering, bullying man who treats her like property. When Louise turned to Thelma and said: “You get what you settle for,” I felt it like a punch to the chest. That line lodged itself in my head. For months afterwards, it echoed through my thoughts as I went through the motions at home. I told myself I was staying for the boys, but it dawned on me that if I made myself ill and depressed with unhappiness, as I was doing, I’d be no good to them anyway. A year or so later, just before Christmas, I’d been out shopping with a neighbour when her car broke down. We were late getting home. I had phoned to explain, but when I walked through the door he launched into a furious tirade. I remember standing there, still holding my coat, and that line coming screaming back. Suddenly, I heard someone say, “That’s it, I’m leaving.” It took a moment to realise the voice was mine. By the end of the following week, I’d found a basement flat through a small ad in the local paper. I left with just a suitcase and my younger son – my husband had emotionally blackmailed our older boy to stay with him, something that still hurts to remember. I had no money, no family nearby, and no real plan beyond survival. Within days of leaving, though, I felt a lightness I hadn’t known for years. I remember bumping into a friend I hadn’t seen for a while, who said: “What’s happened? You look incredible.” I was struggling in every material sense, but for the first time in decades, I could breathe. I began to see my friends a lot more, and poured my love into those relationships – something my husband hadn’t allowed me to do. A few years later I was diagnosed with breast cancer. By then, the boys were older and wonderfully supportive. It was a horrible time, but I remember thinking: “Thank God I’m not still married to him.” That thought was vindication. After 20 years on my own, and in my mid-60s, I moved back up north, closer to my roots. I got involved in community arts work, I met a widower with a love of art, too. I hadn’t been looking for love – after my first marriage, I was very wary of meeting someone else – but something about him felt different. It was just lovely and safe. We married three years ago, in a small, happy celebration surrounded by friends and family. Looking back, I sometimes think of that night at the cinema as the hinge on which my life turned. I will always be grateful to Thelma &amp; Louise, and the friend who took me to see it. That single line – “You get what you settle for” – changed everything. • In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid.

culture_2025_nov_30_fran-lebowitz-interview-love-novels-hiking-leaf-blowers-labubu.txt,culture,2025-11-29,Sian Cain,Fran Lebowitz: ‘Hiking is the most stupid thing I could ever imagine’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/30/fran-lebowitz-interview-love-novels-hiking-leaf-blowers-labubu,"I would like to ask your opinion on five things. First of all, leaf blowers. A horrible, horrible invention. I didn’t even know about them until like 20 years ago when I rented a house in the country. I was shocked! I live in New York City, we don’t have leaf problems. We have every other kind of problem. When I was a kid, we had leaf raking. Which is quiet. Leaf blowers are the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen. First of all, they are incredibly noisy. And second of all, 10 minutes after you use it, that big leaf blower in the sky blows them all back. It’s a very stupid invention. Dinner parties. I like dinner parties at other people’s houses. I do not give them. I think the world is divided between guest and host. I’m a guest. And I’m old, so I generally don’t get stuck at dinner parties I don’t like any more because I’m a very good judge of dinner parties before I go to them. Book clubs. I guess it’s nice people do it but, truthfully, I cannot think of a more solitary activity than reading – which is one of the reasons I love to read. I don’t have any animus against the idea but it certainly doesn’t appeal to me. Airports. Airports are a horrible place invented by leaf blowers. Some are less horrible than others. But you can’t smoke in airports in this country. And airports, like most of life, depend on who’s there. If the person standing at TSA is a nightmarish prison guard, you’re going to have a horrible experience. I have had my hands swiped for explosives more times than anyone you could imagine. And you’re not allowed to say what you’re thinking, which is, “Do I look like the person who has a bomb in my luggage? Let’s be sensible here.” Labubus. I know what they are, unfortunately. There’s been many of these doll fads but these dolls are particularly unappealing-looking to me. What is different, now, is that adults do it. This used to be a thing kids did. But adults have these things connected to their bags and belts. Frankly, they look ridiculous. What is the weirdest thing you have done for love? Romance is not your central concern when you’re 75, let me assure you. People who say it is, they’re lying. So, I don’t know. I realise people think I’m unusual but I’m not weird. I’m not given to grand gestures either. It could be something weird by your own standards – like taking up an extreme sport. Oh, no, no, I would never do that. I was never so young that I ever said, “Oh, mountain climbing sounds fun.” No, it doesn’t sound fun to me. You want to go mountain climbing, have a nice time. I don’t understand why anyone does those things. Hiking is the most stupid thing I could ever imagine. I have watched people play tennis, because that was right at the very beginning of falling in love. Two weeks later? I’m not there any more. You’re famous for always wearing jeans. A lot of people hate buying jeans. Can you tell us the art of selecting the perfect pair of jeans? They no longer make the perfect pair of jeans. If I had known they were going to stop making the perfect pair of Levi’s, I would have bought 100 pairs! They’re not peaches, they’re not going to rot. But I didn’t know. So if you want the perfect pair of jeans, you have to have them made now. Luckily, I have so many pairs of jeans that I’m still in the repairing stage. And I am old so I still think jeans are $25. Anything more than that is ridiculous. You have played a judge in both Law and Order and The Wolf of Wall Street. Is there a particular reason why? I have been asked numerous times to act in movies but I can’t act. It’s a talent and I don’t have it. People will say, “But you were in Law and Order and Wolf of Wall Street!” And I say, “Yes, I played a judge – because I am a judge.” All I do from morning to night is judge. In these instances, I got to actually have a gavel and a robe, which I don’t generally go around with – although I would like to. But I could not play any other role. Do you have a nemesis? Oh, I’m sure I have more than one. I’m sure I have them by the dozen. Luckily, I don’t really pay attention to other people in that way. I know I’m not America’s sweetheart. But even if I knew exactly the name of the person, I wouldn’t tell you. Is there anything that New York could stand to learn or adopt from Australia? I wish we had a building as great as the Sydney Opera House. That would be great. I don’t know where we’d put it but, if they let me, I would find a place. The laws that you have around food are great. There are many great restaurants that I’ve been to in Australia, but the quality of the actual food is fantastic. You don’t let any food in from other places. The most rigorous vetting I’ve ever had in an airport is coming into Australia. “Is that a seed you have on your shoe? Wait, is that a grape?” We could grow every kind of food here but we don’t any more. We get it from all over the place, so you can buy a watermelon in February. It’s horrible. So that’s something Australian I wish we would adopt. But the chances that this present administration would do that is definitely out of the question. What do you think is the most overrated book? I don’t believe I could confine myself to one. There are many overrated writers. I really want contemporary novels to be good but I find I don’t like the majority of them. Lots of times people say, “It’s generational, Fran, this writer is 20.” And my response to that is, “Well it is not good, because that shouldn’t matter.” Do I know how old Chekhov was when he wrote his stories? I don’t. Doesn’t matter. It’s just a great story. Most of my adult life I’ve been very irritated by the legend of F Scott Fitzgerald. So every five years, I reread The Great Gatsby, hoping it’s not that good – but unfortunately it is. What is the oldest thing you own, and why do you still have it? I have tons of old things in my apartment. Most of my furniture is from the 19th century. I have a lot of old books. I still have my childhood sled from when I was really little. I must have been, at the most, six years old. It has a rope tied to it so you could pull it up the hill – I remember watching my father tie that rope on. I also have my original childhood wagon. And like everything else in this apartment, there are books on them. What is the worst job you’ve ever done? Boy, I had a lot of bad jobs when I was young. New York City was full of bad jobs in the 70s. You could get a different bad job every week, and I did. I used to think, “I hate this job. I’m going to get a different bad job.” And then I would hate that job. Finally, I realised, and this is the truth – “Fran, you just don’t like to work”. I would have been a fantastic heiress. You were a New York taxi driver in the 70s, right? I was. That was a bad job. It wasn’t bad in terms of money – you got paid in cash and you’d go to these big garages to get a cab every eight hours, so you’d always have money. But it was a dangerous job – nothing ever happened to me, but that was just luck. What has been your most memorable interaction with a fan? I’m in the street a lot and I take the subway, more than most people who get recognised in the street. People say, “Don’t you hate it?” I don’t hate it. Because most of the people who want to talk to you like you. Though let me assure you, I get plenty of people who say worse things to my face. And people send terrible mail. Luckily, I’m not on the internet, so I don’t see the stuff about me on the internet, good or bad. I don’t care what other people think about me. If you don’t like me, don’t read my books and don’t watch my stuff! An Evening with Fran Lebowitz is touring Australia and New Zealand in May 2026; see here for dates"
culture_2025_oct_19_cant-stop-watching-first-time-hearing-videos.txt,culture,2025-10-18,Nick Miller,I can’t stop watching videos of people discovering Beds Are Burning by Midnight Oil. Send help,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/19/cant-stop-watching-first-time-hearing-videos,"Oh the pleasant pain of waiting impatiently for someone to understand the point! Oh the power of dramatic irony; the smug joy of knowing something they don’t. Oh how I wallowed in these feelings and more, when YouTube sucked me into a genre I had previously known nothing about: First Time Hearing videos, where people film themselves watching the music video of a song they’ve never heard before and grace viewers with their impromptu reactions, thoughts and facial expressions. Even before noticing the six-figures-plus viewing counts and the apparently endless number of people vying to deliver more, I instantly clocked all the trappings of the very best attention economy traps. You know: the immediate, certain knowledge that – despite your best intentions, growing hunger, thirst and backpain; despite the increasingly urgent pleas of your neglected children – you’re just going to slump there swiping your finger for hours until your higher brain finally kicks in. The first one my algorithm mugged me with was from US rapper Black Pegasus, who told us he was listening for the first time to Tim Minchin’s song Prejudice. The tension of the format works best if the viewer is familiar with the music. In this case, I was aware that Minchin’s song – an entertaining muse about how offended people get by a six-letter word made up of “a couple of Gs, an R and an E, an I and an N” – is a very long tease that he’s about to say something racist before (spoiler alert, sorry) he doesn’t. In this particular case, with an unsuspecting Black American listening and recording his reaction. It has received 324,000 views. That was mildly entertaining, I thought. So when I clocked the hello-i-am-here-to-help-you-get-addicted column, I clicked on another video from the same guy: his FIRST TIME REACTION to Midnight Oil’s 1987 hit Beds Are Burning. If Tim Minchin was the gateway drug, I’d just found the good stuff, the main line. I believe I have watched every single person on the internet recording their reaction to their first time listening to (and watching the video of) Beds Are Burning. Like all good addicts I couldn’t tell you how many hits I took. Hours passed like minutes, and minutes passed like days. Tension is a big selling point in these videos, and it’s often ratcheted up multiple times, mid-song, by use of the pause button. Sometimes they talk for ages in the interregnum, trying to puzzle out the lyrics or hook. What’s this guy going on about? Why does he look so funny? Is he Or-Stralian? Why have I never heard this before? (The answer is that young people are far too busy swiping through short-form video to absorb the full cultural canon.) Sometimes it might be a brief “This slaps!” Yes, you solemnly nod, I know. I know this song and you do not. I am in charge here. So I will keep watching. To the end. Whether it be a couple who call themselves The Wolf Hunterz and realise they have heard it before after all but inexplicably push on, or an almost incomprehensible Glaswegian thrilled by the song’s “minning”. Some vloggers are quicker than others in picking up the theme. Some are hampered by mishearing the lyrics (Dereck, poor Dereck, thought “the birds are burning”). Some take a while to warm to the music. Everyone’s first reaction is that Peter Garrett has a funny voice. And then, sooner or later, their eyes widen. I love watching it happen. The chorus soars. The message sinks in (except for Dereck). The alchemy of music, politics and passion got them. Some, I think genuinely, cry. Ohhhhh yeahhhh. Now completely surrendered to the algorithm, I watched some First Time Hearing of Land Down Under and Who Can It Be Now – and possibly more. It’s hard to say. Finally, I found myself watching First Time Hearing John Farnham singing Help and I realised I had fundamentally broken my brain. It was time to delete the app and seek professional help for my back."
culture_2025_oct_20_norman-greenbaum-spirit-in-the-sky-cook-no-1-jesus.txt,culture,2025-10-20,Interviews by Dave Simpson,‘I was working as a cook when it went to No 1’: how Norman Greenbaum made Spirit in the Sky,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/20/norman-greenbaum-spirit-in-the-sky-cook-no-1-jesus,"Norman Greenbaum, singer, guitarist, songwriter Spirit in the Sky started as an old blues riff I’d been playing since my college days in Boston, but I didn’t know what to do with it. After I moved to LA, a guy I knew came up with a way of putting a fuzzbox inside my Fender Telecaster, which created the distinctive sound on Spirit in the Sky. I’d come across a greeting card with a picture of some Native Americans praying to the “spirit in the sky”. The phrase stuck in my head. One night I was watching country music on TV and the singer Porter Wagoner sang a gospel song, which gave me the idea to write religious lyrics. Although I came from a semi-religious Jewish family, I wasn’t religious, but found myself writing Christian lyrics such as “When I die and they lay me to rest, I’m going to the place that’s the best” and “Gotta have a friend in Jesus”. It came together very quickly. Soon after that, I was playing the Troubadour club in LA when the Lovin’ Spoonful’s producer Erik Jacobsen walked in. He said he had a production deal with Warner Brothers and was interested in signing me. When we recorded Spirit in the Sky for my debut album, the finished mix sent shivers up my spine. Initially, Warner said a four-minute single containing lyrics about Jesus would never get played on pop radio, but eventually they relented. In 1969, it sold two million copies. But I couldn’t recreate the success. In 1986, I was working as a cook when Dr and the Medics took it back to No 1 in the UK. Then Gareth Gates’s 2003 version meant it was No 1 in three different decades. It’s been in countless movies, including Apollo 13, Oceans 11 and Guardians of the Galaxy. I’m 82. A few years ago, I was a passenger in a car crash and spent three weeks in a coma. I feel like I was granted another life. So now every day, I pray and give thanks to the spirit in the sky. Erik Jacobsen, producer I saw Norman at a hootenanny at the Troubadour singing one song, School for Sweet Talk, but he said: “I’ve got a million songs I’d love to play for ya.” It turned out he’d had a minor hit called The Eggplant That Ate Chicago with a group called Dr West’s Medicine Show and Junk Band and had a whole raft of crazy songs about goats, chickens or a Chinese guy who ate some acid. I said: “Let’s make some records that somebody might like.” I put him together with Norman Mayell, the drummer from San Francisco psychedelic group Sopwith Camel, and Doug Killmer, a bassist, who’d played a lot of black music. The Spirit in the Sky riff originated in an old John Lee Hooker tune called Boogie Chillen’ and set the tone for where the song went, but the rhythm track sounded too loose. I got Norman to bring his acoustic guitar in and we recorded two performances – each slightly different – and made it stereo. Then we brought in gospel singers the Stovall Singers and their church-type clapping became a key part of the groove. A guitarist called Russell DaShiell played a hell of a solo. By now, the track was sounding immense, but when I heard Norman’s little vocal, my heart sank. It just wasn’t heavy enough, so once again I recorded two performances and combined the two together. I thought: “Thank God!” It sounded amazing. The single got a lot of play on KRLA, a hugely influential radio station, but it came out just before Christmas, when people buy records for others, not for themselves, so there were no sales. KRLA stopped playing it. Then, two weeks into January, 22,000 orders came in from record stores in LA. Everyone started playing it again – and it just took off. The funny thing is that when we went in to record it, my engineer was sick but we went ahead anyway with just a handful of little mics, no headphones and no sound baffling. Every sound was coming in on every mic, but it sounded great. For years people asked: “How in the world did you get that sound?” I said: “I just pointed the amps right at the drums. I had no idea what I was doing.” • Norman Greenbaum’s 1969 debut, Spirit in the Sky, is available on vinyl on Craft Recordings, with a Dolby Atmos mix of the single on Apple Music.

culture_2025_oct_21_jon-stewart-donald-trump-no-kings-protests.txt,culture,2025-10-21,Guardian staff,Jon Stewart on Donald Trump: ‘He’s the imitation crab of kings right now’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/21/jon-stewart-donald-trump-no-kings-protests,"Late-night hosts recapped the record-breaking No Kings rallies against Donald Trump and mocked Republican attempts to dismiss the protests. Jon Stewart Jon Stewart returned to his Daily Show post on Monday night, riding high from the energy of the No Kings rallies against Trump over the weekend, which Mike Johnson, the US House speaker, dismissed as the “hate America rally, and Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, called participants “the farthest left, the hardest core, the most unhinged in the Democratic party”. “So, this weekend, we sat in our bunkers, doors locked, windows boarded, muskets and cyanide pills at the ready, prepared for whatever the hardest core had in store,” Stewart joked. “Do your worst, display your Marxism to its fullest!” In truth, the peaceful protests drew more than 7 million people in 2,700 locations in all 50 states, for the largest single-day protest against a sitting president in US history. “It was kind of an incredible turnout that was somewhat inspiring,” Stewart said. “Seven million Americans, zero mass shootings? I look forward to Republicans apologizing sincerely for implying these Americans were … what’s the word I’m looking for? Deplorable!” In light of the peaceful demonstrations, Fox News commentators called the protests “silly” and “dumb”. “Make up your mind, Fox,” Stewart mocked. “You complained it would be a terrifyingly ‘shit your pants’ protest, and now you are complaining about how boringly unpants-shitting it was? “Although there was one nit you picked that really felt off brand,” he added – the criticism, by some Fox News pundits, that the protests were full of too many “angry old white people”. “Extra extra, read all about it! ‘This country has too many angry old white people,’ says – hold on – Fox News,” Stewart joked. “Fox News says: ‘Why are old white people so angry?’ Fox News, mad that there are so many old white people in America. I don’t think Fox News is mad, I think they’re jealous.” Stewart then played archival coverage of the Tea Party protests during the Obama era, and sarcastically added: “Imagine a bunch of old white people in costumes angrily protesting the direction and overreach of an ever-encroaching federal government. I mean, preposterous. That’s in no way a movement that could sweep the midterms and then be harnessed by a charismatic demagogue to remake an entire political party. I mean, it’s laughable.” In seriousness, Stewart called the rallies “unfocused gatherings” with a significant amount of “political potential”, yet saw the simultaneous events as “a great day for democracy”. “Look, maybe Trump isn’t an all-powerful king, the kind who can do whatever he wants, but he’s undeniably king-adjacent, king-esque, moving for more,” he added. “He’s the imitation crab of kings right now. The ‘I can’t believe it’s not king.’” Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also compared the coverage of the 7 million-strong No Kings protests to the Tea Party protests, which were “much smaller, but commanded an obsessive amount of media attention”. “It’s worth keeping the comparison between the two rallies in mind, just to put into perspective just how unprecedented these anti-Trump protests have been,” he said. “So naturally, Trump has responded by choosing to lie about them.” Speaking to reporters, Trump claimed that the protests were “paid for by Soros and other radical left lunatics” and that the demonstrations were “very small, very ineffective, and the people who went were whacked out.” “What do you mean they were ‘whacked out’?” Meyers asked. “Most of the protesters that I saw were grandmas playing banjos, inflatable frogs – you sound like a Staten Island dad explaining why Uncle Gino can’t make it to Christmas. “Trump is desperate to pretend that his popularity makes him invincible, but the No Kings protests prove the opposite is true,” he added. “He’s stirred an unprecedented level of protest and discontent, and now he’s threatening to respond by using the military.” Specifically, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 measure that allows the president to deploy troops nationally and federalize the national guard in case of emergencies. In Trump’s view, the law, as he told, Fox News, provided him “unquestioned power”. Meyers said: “I like how his response to the No Kings rally is a reminder as to why it was a good idea to have a No Kings rally – ‘I’m not king, and I shall prove it with my unquestioned power.’” Stephen Colbert And on the Late Show, Stephen Colbert touched on Trump’s other response to the No Kings protest: On Saturday, he posted an AI video of himself wearing a crown while flying a jet and spraying New York City protesters with feces. “This video that he’s posting might be upsetting to sensitive viewers who do not like watching the president of the United States carpet-pooping his own citizens,” Colbert warned before playing the clip. “There it is! King Trump crapping on America. Which is insane, though I will grant: factually accurate.” Colbert took a second to thank CBS for letting him air the clip, as “some networks are not showing that video because it’s so disturbing,” he said. “There’s rational reasons to not show that video. But I think we’re way beyond rationality at this point. So, thank you, CBS.” Colbert elaborated on a number of disturbing elements within the video: “Number one, the number two. Second, eat a vegetable, baby! Throw a handful of flaxseeds in your milkshake – you’ve got a real problem!” He then turned serious: “This video was vile and violent and only proves the point of the No Kings march even more. “What decent democratic leader would ever post a video of themselves shitting on peaceful protesters?” he added. “He is a one-man hate march. I mean, does he have a late-night show we can cancel?”"
culture_2025_oct_21_london-museum-identifies-black-waterloo-veteran-in-rare-1821-painting.txt,culture,2025-10-21,Donna Ferguson,London museum identifies black Waterloo veteran in rare 1821 painting,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/21/london-museum-identifies-black-waterloo-veteran-in-rare-1821-painting,"He fought in the Napoleonic wars and is one of only nine Black soldiers known to have received the Waterloo Medal, the first British medal awarded to soldiers regardless of their rank. Yet the story of Pte Thomas James has been overlooked for centuries. Now the National Army Museum in London has identified James as the likely subject of an “extraordinarily rare” painting from 1821, which it has attributed to the artist Thomas Phillips, whose more typical sitters were Georgian luminaries such as the Duke of Wellington and Lord Byron. The portrait will be unveiled to the public on Tuesday at the museum’s “Army at Home” gallery in Chelsea, where it will be placed on permanent display to highlight the service of James and other Black soldiers during the Napoleonic wars. “There’s this misconception that there weren’t any Black soldiers at Waterloo,” said the museum’s art curator, Anna Lavelle. “That’s not the fault of the public – it’s not been in the historical discourse. And yet Thomas James is one of many.” James’s story deserves to be celebrated and he should be better known, she said. “He was willing to get hurt and put his life at risk for other people in his regiment.” James, an illiterate percussionist in the 18th Light Dragoons, was likely to have been born enslaved in Montserrat, the West Indies, in 1789. Little is known about his early life. By the time he enlisted in 1809, he had made his way to Sussex, where slavery had been abolished, and was describing himself as “a servant”. He was awarded the Waterloo Medal after being wounded fighting a band of Prussian soldiers who had deserted and tried to loot his officers’ belongings. “There were about 20 soldiers who were looking after the officers’ baggage, but James was the only one noted to have been severely wounded,” she said. “He obviously put up a really good fight – a spirited defence – which I think says a lot about his character and his sense of camaraderie.” Officers, she said, must also have felt they could trust James with their belongings, probably containing money, jewellery and mess silver. “I think he was brave foremost, and honourable as well.” James’s portrait shows him in a bright white cavalry uniform, holding cymbals, suggesting he had a particularly flamboyant role in the band. “Bandsmen would swing cymbals under their legs, flip them up into the air, catch them and clang them together loudly … it would have been quite a theatrical, high energy performance, and taken a lot of skill.” Options for Black men in Georgian England were limited and men who did not wish to be servants often, like James, enlisted in the army as military musicians, she said: “Black soldiers wore the same uniform and were paid the same wages and pension as their white counterparts – and in the army hierarchy, a Black soldier and a white soldier of the same rank have to treat each other equally.” Black bandsmen were so sought after for regimental bands that they knew they would find a “small community” of other soldiers of colour within the army, she said, and when their regiments disbanded, Black soldiers would “overwhelmingly re-enlist”. When the museum acquired the portrait for £30,000 last year, the identity of both the sitter and the painter were unknown. “We just had a hunch it was special,” said Lavelle, who researched medal records and used clues such as the cymbals and the sitter’s uniform to identify James as the likely subject. She thinks that officers probably commissioned the portrait to celebrate James for his courage: “This portrait would have been expensive – it’s not something James, or any other private in the army, would have been able to pay for themselves.” Portraits of individual, known Black British soldiers were “extraordinarily rare”, she said – she knows of only two others in existence from the period. “This is a portrait which can help us to tell the story of Black bandsmen in general and the important role they played in history.” She points out that James is wearing a ring and is depicted in a relaxed pose, looking directly at the viewer: “He comes across in the painting as quietly confident – a soldier who is dignified and has a real sense of pride.”"

Many of the UK’s 20,000-plus listed places of worship contain important heritage treasures, such as stained glass windows, and monuments of historic significance. They are also hubs for community groups and social action projects. But, according to a survey by the National Churches Trust, one in 20 churches say they will definitely or probably not be used as a place of worship by 2030. Rural churches are most at risk, with about 900 in danger of closing in the next five years. One in five churches say their building has deteriorated in the past five years, and almost two in five say their roof is at risk or in urgent need of repair, according to the survey of more than 3,600 churches across the UK. Nearly one in three churches are forced to draw on reserves to cover basic costs. Earlier this year, the government imposed VAT on repairs to places of worship costing more than £25,000, placing an additional burden on communities already dependent on fundraising, grants and donations to maintain heritage buildings. Church of England parishes face a £1bn repair backlog and an ongoing annual maintenance bill of £150m. The historian and broadcaster Alice Loxton told the conference that churches were the “crown jewels of our heritage” and “cultural vandalism is happening under our noses” with their “quiet decay”. Tristram Hunt, the director of the V&amp;A, said keeping churches open and in good repair was “one of the most important heritage challenges we face”. Sir Philip Rutnam, chair of the National Churches Trust, said the government should establish a capital funding scheme of £50m a year to ensure historical places of worship did not fall into disrepair, and in recognition that “local communities shouldn’t have to struggle by themselves”. He added: “Without intervention, the risks are enormous – we will lose more and more of these buildings and all they embody for good.” The survey found that three-quarters of churches were used by community groups, more than half hosted food banks or were involved in food distribution, a third offered mental health support, and one in five provided debt advice. The barrister and broadcaster Rob Rinder said: “The story of Britain, at the moment, tragically, is being hijacked, perhaps by some people who claim to speak for its soul while doing everything to hollow it out. “Many of those will shout about patriotism, but seem to have no real enduring love for the places where ordinary decency still lives and breathes. If you want to see the real British values at work … go to [my local] church on a rainy Tuesday or Wednesday night. There you’ll find people of every colour, every faith, every accent, quietly holding our country together … To save these buildings is to save something fundamental about Britain itself, the Britain that still believes in fairness, hospitality and humour … the Britain that looks after one another quietly.” As a Jew, he said, he did not worship in these churches, but he understood their power. “These buildings are the heartbeat of Britain.” The archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, said the C of E “can and must do more financially” to help cash-strapped parishes facing huge repair and maintenance bills, but that the government and state must also help protect these “places of community”. He continued: “In a world where we too easily become too polarised, too separate from each other and store up all these divisions, surely we should be strengthening those places which bring us together.”"
culture_2025_oct_22_stephen-colbert-trump-white-house-demolition.txt,culture,2025-10-22,Guardian staff,Stephen Colbert on Trump’s White House East Wing demolition: ‘So deeply unsettling’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/22/stephen-colbert-trump-white-house-demolition,"Late-night hosts reacted to Donald Trump’s partial demolition of the East Wing of the White House for his proposed $250m gilded ballroom. Stephen Colbert “At this point, we’re nine months into this, you’d think it would be impossible for us to be shocked by Donald Trump,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. “But give the man credit – every so often, he takes the time to attach the electrodes to our nipples. And then it feels like the first time.” Case in point: on Monday, as part of his White House renovation project to construct a gilded ballroom, Trump sent out a backhoe to rip off a part of the East Wing. “That is it, we are not giving him the security deposit back,” Colbert quipped. “That is so deeply unsettling,” he continued. “It’s like being a kid and seeing your teacher at the grocery store … for sale … in the meat department. “We’re just nine months into Trump’s term, and he’s already going ‘Hulk smash’ on the White House. Last time, it took at least four years to bring a demo crew to the Capitol,” he added, referring to January 6. The demolition comes after Trump promised that the $250m, 90,000-sq-ft ballroom renovation would not touch the existing White House. “So that was a lie,” said Colbert. “At this point, should we even believe that this is going to end up being a ballroom? It could just as easily end up being a combination Pizza Hut-Taco Bell!” The treasury department has even instructed its employees not to share any photos of the White House “construction”. “Not generally something you instruct when you’re proud of what’s going on,” Colbert noted. “Hey guys, remember, no photos at my wedding … and it’s not because I’m marrying a body pillow of Mariah Carey.’” The Daily Show “The government shutdown is now in its third week,” said Michael Kosta on the Daily Show. “Countless federal employees aren’t being paid. Food stamps will run out soon. And there’s no end in sight. But not to worry – President Trump is working day and night … to build a ballroom! “It’s exactly what you voted for, coalminers in Pennsylvania: 90,000 gilded sq ft for Trump to do the jerk-off dance in,” he joked. “But if you’re worried such a renovation might damage the people’s house, let Donald Trump put your fears to rest.” Trump claimed that the project would “not interfere with the current building” because it would be “near it but not touching it” and “paying total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of, it’s my favorite” “Yeah, it’s my favorite. I never want to leave … and I’m never going to,” Kosta mocked. “I believe it’s his favorite building, though. He loves the history, the decor, the immunity from criminal convictions it provides. But great! The White House itself is going to be fine.” Until a backhoe tore down some of the East Wing facade. “Well, it looks like they touched it,” Kosta joked. “I mean, holy shit, who’s his general contractor? Bin Laden and Sons?” “Apparently ‘not touching’ the White House turned into ‘demolishing’ the White House,” he added. “And for what? Does he really need a ballroom attached to his home? I mean, I guess it would be good to have one room where Barron did not have to crouch, but still.” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers also responded to the East Wing demolition. “You guys, I don’t think he’s planning on leaving in three years,” he said. “If I had three years left on a lease, I wouldn’t even put up a shelf.” In other news, during a White House press conference on Monday, Trump claimed that a cameraman hit a mirror with a piece of equipment. “Luckily, no one in his administration casts a reflection,” Meyers joked next to a photo of ghoulish adviser Stephen Miller. After Trump praised the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, during a press conference on Monday, Albanese said that he would use clips of those compliments in 2028 campaign ads. “So will I, said his opponent,” Meyers quipped. And more than a dozen airports across the country have refused to play a partisan video of the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, at TSA checkpoints. “It just really riles up the dogs,” Meyers said, referring to Noem’s admission in her own memoir that she shot her own puppy for its behavior."
culture_2025_oct_23_late-night-trump-white-house-demolition.txt,culture,2025-10-23,Guardian staff,Seth Meyers on Trump’s White House demolition: ‘This is insane’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/23/late-night-trump-white-house-demolition,"Late-night hosts dissected Donald Trump’s kingly behavior, from the destruction of the White House’s East Wing to his demand for payment from the justice department. Seth Meyers “We have warned for years that Donald Trump is destroying American institutions,” said Seth Meyers on Wednesday evening, “but of course when we said ‘destroying’, we meant metaphorically speaking. We didn’t mean that he was literally destroying buildings.” “But I guess Trump heard that and thought, ‘On it.’ Because now he’s literally destroying the East Wing of the White House,” the Late Night host continued. The previously unannounced construction comes just days after record-breaking No Kings protests against Trump’s behavior as president, and as fellow Republicans continue to claim that he does not act like an authoritarian leader. “You guys, they’re right. Trump is not a king!” Meyers joked. “A king is someone who presumes the power to do whatever they want without consulting someone else. Someone who treats public property and public resources of the state as their own. Someone who surrounds themselves with lavish appointments and gilded furnishings and the trappings of wealth and power.” Such as, say, a $250m, 90,000 sq ft gilded ballroom, as Trump has unilaterally proposed for the White House. “This is insane,” said Meyers over a photo of the demolished East Wing. “This looks like a scene from an apocalyptic disaster movie. This is the first thing aliens do in movies to announce they’re evil. They blow up the White House. Trump is just cutting out the middleman of invading aliens. “No one was consulted about this,” he added. “No one approved of this. Congress certainly didn’t get a say. The White House isn’t Trump’s – it’s supposed to be ours.” Between this and his demand that the justice department pay him as punishment for investigations against him, Trump “is responding to the massive and historic No Kings protests with two cartoonishly straightforward examples of kingly behavior.” Stephen Colbert “In the ongoing lowering of our national limbo bar, I gotta say: Donald Trump has proven himself to surprisingly limber for a man with those cankles,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. “Because in just the last 24 hours alone, he’s achieved two new lows.” First, the White House demolition. And second, a demand of $230m from the justice department as compensation for cases against him stemming from his first term as president. And technically, as president again, he could now order the government to pay him. “Well, that doesn’t seem right,” said Colbert. “I mean, if you’re going to do that, why stop at $230m? Why don’t you just let him go to Fort Knox, lose the pants and go Scrooge McDuck into a pile of gold? “Now, if you’re saying ‘a judge would never allow that’ – oh you sweet, stupid child,” he added. “This don’t go before no judge.” They’re administrative claims that would be settled by senior officials in the Department of Justice … who are all appointed by Trump, some of whom once served on his personal legal team. “His own lawyers decide whether he wins,” Colbert reiterated. “It’s like that classic drama Twelve Angry Men Who Were All at My Bachelor Party. “This is so crazy, even Trump is aware of how insane the situation is,” he continued, pointing to comments Trump made just last week, where he acknowledges “it sorta looks bad, I’m suing myself”. “Yeah, it looks bad. You sue you, and you get to decide which one of yous wins … I’m guessing you do,” said Colbert. “It’s an endless loop of corruption, like Möbius grift. I think they call it the circle of jerk.” The Daily Show And on The Daily Show, Michael Kosta also looked into Trump’s $230m demand from his own government. “I know it’s not exactly what Black people wanted, but the American government is finally paying reparations,” Kosta joked. “Well, it is to an old white millionaire president, but that’s why you need to be more specific when you’re manifesting.” Kosta pointed out that the people in charge of approving the payment, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, and deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, used to work for Trump’s legal team. “Don’t worry, I’m sure Todd Blanche will take his time and very carefully consider … what color pen he will use to sign the check over to his president boss,” Kosta said. “Let me spell this out for you: Trump’s own former lawyers are the ones who get to decide if Trump gets this payout from the government that Trump is in charge of. “So if you can’t believe how good Trump’s luck is, he also can’t seem to believe it,” he added before a clip of Trump in the Oval Office calling the situation “awfully strange”. “It seems like even Trump is suspicious about how easy this is,” Kosta concluded. “This must be how those thieves at the Louvre felt – ‘So, all I need is a ladder? I thought this would be way more complicated. I’ll steal these invaluable jewels, I guess.’”"
culture_2025_oct_24_how-did-toe-shoes-become-so-popular.txt,culture,2025-10-23,Caitlin Cassidy explains it to Cait Kelly,Toe-curling fashion: how did toe shoes become so popular?,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/24/how-did-toe-shoes-become-so-popular,"Caitlin, I am a big proponent of not yucking someone else’s yum. But this is testing me. What are on those girlies’ feet? They’re toes, Cait. They’re toes. More specifically, toes encased in rubber to create a kind of foot-glove-trainer. The shoes are made by an Italian company, Vibram, and they’re called “FiveFingers”. Why five fingers instead of five toes? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter. They’re cool now. Vibrams used to be known for making kind of niche running shoes, but their toe shoe has since become all the rage – albeit somewhat divisively – among trendy young people. Polarising, for one, because they look terrifying. And for practical reasons: it takes a little while to individually separate and fit your toes into the proper spots. But once you do, apparently it’s like wearing nothing at all. I like a trend – I’m glad vests came back. But I am not yet convinced about toe shoes. Who has decided these are chic? Where has this come from? As with many trends, celebrities started wearing them, then magazines started writing about them, and now every cool twentysomething you know is sporting them on TikTok. While they were launched back in 2006, it took pop star Doechii wearing FiveFingers in her music video for Anxiety in April this year for the ball to start to roll. Three months later, K-pop star Jennie Kim of Blackpink was papped wearing a pair at Seoul international airport. The same month, Grazia Daily UK declared Vibram’s “ugly shoe” one of 2025’s “hottest items”. Teen Vogue got on board. A collaboration with Balenciaga was announced, with a “toe shoe collection” on the cards. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning They may be ugly, but they are unstoppable. In the words of Marie Claire, “there’s no tip-toeing around this freaky shoe trend”. Are there benefits to my toes having their own bit of shoe? Are they … comfortable? As someone who basically lives in boots and Birkenstocks and does not run competitively, I would not know. I’ve never worn them. But allegedly, they are comfortable. FiveFingers were originally marketed as a functional performance shoe for exercise, marketed to tech bros and gym junkies as mimicking barefoot running, before receiving street credibility. It’s not just comfort they offer though. According to Vibram, their product transcends footwear. It’s a “mindset”. “Imagine a life where every step feels light, where movement is fluid and instinctive, where your feet are alive with sensation,” Vibram’s website reads. “You are not just moving, you are awakening.” Come for the shoe, stay for the enlightenment. I feel this could be like when we all hated on crocs and then ended up getting a pair. How many pennies should I be expecting to part with here? Significantly more than the humble croc, I’m afraid. New Vibram styles are sold online for around A$150 to A$300, and they’re going for in excess of $300 on the reseller website Depop. Matching toe socks, which retail at about $20, are optional. It’s their exclusivity that is undoubtedly part of the allure. But, like crocs, you could also argue their very repulsiveness is what gives them attraction. This is 2025. Women don’t need to ache all day in stilettos to prove themselves. You can fashion your feet to look like a weird, prehistoric reptile if you want to, and be really comfortable while you do. You can feel the earth beneath your feet. You can transcend! Or, like me, you can put on your well-worn pair of Birkenstocks and call it a day."

A passionate advocate for the arts, he was appointed to the post in the council’s newly established leisure services department in 1975, following the national reorganisation of local authorities. There, for 20 years, he transformed the artistic life of Nottinghamshire through development and funding of arts activities across the county. In the town of Retford, he supported the internationally famous Cantamus girls choir and, in Mansfield, the Mansfield Palace theatre. Events ranged from concerts by world-renowned musicians such as Vladimir Ashkenazy, André Previn and the pianist John Ogdon, a native of Nottinghamshire, to poetry readings by established poets such as Aeronwy Thomas, Dylan’s daughter. Born in Llantwit Major, a working-class village in the Vale of Glamorgan, John was one of the three children of Florence (nee Mitchell), a cleaner at the nearby RAF St Athan airbase, and Ronald, a security officer at the airbase. John attended Barry boys grammar school, where he excelled at languages, and he went on to obtain a first-class honours degree from the University of Liverpool in Latin American studies. His youth was shaped by a period of ideological foment and counter-thinking that influenced his outlook. For his national service, he joined the Royal Army Education Corps, where he served in Hong Kong and Cyprus. He went on to teach Spanish at Wath upon Dearne grammar school in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, where he met Joyce Lotts. They married in 1969, and moved to Cowbridge, in Glamorgan, in 1972, where he worked as a county adult education officer. I was born in 1970, my brother, Daniel, the following year, and my sister, Catherine, in 1973. Two years later, the family moved to West Bridgford, Nottingham, when Dad became the county council’s arts director. Retiring in the mid-1990s, Dad remained politically active, campaigning for the Labour party. He was an avid Guardian reader and crossword enthusiast, winning prizes several times and maintaining his intellectual rigour until his final days. He was always entertaining those around him with amusing witticisms, particularly those with a Welsh flavour. Gentle and exceptionally well read, Dad’s legacy lives on in some of his published poetry. He was a devoted family man and a lifelong champion of socialist causes and human rights whose intellectual curiosity and gentle nature touched many. John and Joyce divorced in 2007. He is survived by Daniel, Catherine and me, 11 grandchildren and his sisters, Mary and Jean."
culture_2025_oct_24_seth-meyers-trump-ballroom-white-house.txt,culture,2025-10-24,Guardian staff,Seth Meyers on Trump’s White House ballroom: ‘This couldn’t be any more of a bait and switch’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/24/seth-meyers-trump-ballroom-white-house,"Late-night hosts mocked Donald Trump’s demolition of the East Wing of the White House and the corporate sponsors of his $300m gilded ballroom. Seth Meyers On Thursday’s Late Night, Seth Meyers expressed disbelief over the president’s gilded ballroom project for the White House. “It would be bad enough if Trump’s biggest priority was just building a gilded vanity project for himself, but it’s so much worse,” he said. “Because to do it, he’s tearing down a somewhat well-known and beloved piece of property.” That would be the entire East Wing of the presidential residence, which has stood for 120 years. “He’s tearing down the entire East Wing to build his stupid ballroom. I mean, look at this,” Meyers marveled. “This is like a sequel to Fixer Upper called Fucked Upper. “And of course, Trump also lied about this project.” When he first announced it, he promised no demolition and said it “won’t interfere with the current building” because it would be “near it but not touching it”. “So he basically promised to treat it like his marriage,” Meyers quipped. Trump said plans had changed “after really a tremendous amount of study with some of the best architects in the world”. “Oh yeah? Who was the architect you talked to, Godzilla?” Meyers joked. Outrage has been swift, if ineffective. The National Trust for Historic Preservation sent a letter to Trump saying that the addition would overwhelm the structure and asked him to pause construction until the plans could be reviewed. “One, I couldn’t agree more with the National Trust for Historic Preservation,” said Meyers. “And two, good luck with your letter. “This couldn’t be any more of a bait and switch,” he added. “Trump got elected by claiming he was going to make life more affordable for hardworking Americans, and now he’s demolishing the White House to build himself a gilded vanity project.” Stephen Colbert “As of this morning, the East Wing looked like a rotisserie chicken your dog got into,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. “That is very upsetting to look at, I realize that, and you know the administration knows that,” because on Thursday, the Secret Service closed access to the Ellipse park, a public area where journalists had been capturing images of the demolition. “Well that makes sense – if none of it is on camera, they can just claim the East Wing hanged itself in prison,” Colbert quipped. The host pointed out that it was “a lot of history being smashed to rubble”, as the East Wing was built in 1902 and had been the headquarters for presidential spouses since the Carter administration. “In fact, Melania was in the East Wing, and I certainly hope they got her out of there because she’s often mistaken for a beautiful floor lamp,” Colbert joked over a photo in one of the first lady’s more non-traditional outfits. Trump has funded the “ball-doggle” with money from “groveling corporations” including Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Google, Microsoft, T-Mobile, Meta Platforms and Hard Rock International. “And Trump needs all the cash he can get,” said Colbert, as the estimated cost has already risen from an initial $250m to over $300m, for a 90,000 sq-ft (8,400 sq-meter) construction, larger than the existing White House itself. “That’s about the same size as a professional soccer field,” Colbert noted. “So remember, corporations, as you bribe the president: no hands.” The Daily Show And on the Daily Show, Michael Kosta tracked the swift evolution of the project from proposal to execution. “When he started, he promised that it would be separate from the existing White House and he wouldn’t touch the East Wing. That this construction would strictly be over the pants,” he recapped. “Then this week, there was a minor change to the plan when Trump ripped open the side of the East Wing like it had a Labubu inside.” By Thursday, the entire East Wing was gone. “This is all happening so fast,” he said. “This guy’s been taking 15 years to give us a healthcare plan, but in 3.5 days he’s demolished half the White House. Donny T, tell me this is going to end up looking good …” Not quite – according to Trump’s own scale model, which he presented in the Oval Office, the ballroom will dwarf the current White House. “It looks like one of those crabs with the big arms, doesn’t it?” Kosta laughed. “I mean, I don’t know a lot about architecture. But I do know a thing or two about overcompensating for a small penis.”"
culture_2025_oct_24_the-guide-culture-to-help-you-fall-asleep.txt,culture,2025-10-24,Gwilym Mumford,The Guide #214: Sleep-inducing songs and tranquilising TV – the culture that sends us to sleep (in a good way),https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/24/the-guide-culture-to-help-you-fall-asleep,"How do you sleep at night? If you’re like Hannah, a recent subject of the Guardian’s My cultural awakening column, it’s to the sound of a rat whisking eggs. The series shares stories of people who made a significant life change thanks to a piece of popular culture, and in the case of Hannah, that meant curing insomnia by watching Ratatouille. Every night for the last 15 years, at home or abroad, she switches on the Pixar classic and, within minutes, finds herself dropping off, thanks to the film’s comforting, consistent soundscape. It’s so effective, in fact, she’s never even seen it all the way through. Hannah’s might be a bit of an extreme example, but her tale does touch on something universal: culture seems to play an increasingly important role these days in helping people nod off. Head over to Spotify, Apple Music or any of the other music streaming sites and you’ll find endless playlists promising to ease you into a deep sleep. You’ll find similar on the BBC’s radio stations: 6Music’s Dream Time, a late-night audio mix from DJ Zakia Sewell; Radio 1’s Deep Sleepscapes, which repurposes audio footage from the Beeb’s nature programming; or The Sleeping Forecast, which splices ambient and classical music with snippets from the shipping forecast. That latter series comes from Radio 3 Unwind, a new sister station to Radio 3 designed to “enhance wellbeing”, so naturally encouraging a good night’s sleep is central to a lot of their programming. There’s an entire sub-category of podcasting to send you under, too: series like Nothing Much Happens, which offers storytelling that is interesting enough to hold your attention but pitched at an intensity that won’t keep you gripped and wakeful. While audio might be a natural accompaniment to zonking off, screen-based culture is usually dissuaded by proponents of “sleep hygiene”. Still, as someone who regularly dozes off in front of the box, no matter how well-made and enjoyable the thing on it is, I can confirm that film and television can be of great assistance in conking out, too. And of course, “reading a few pages of a book before inevitably nodding off” has been a tried and trusted sleep aid for centuries. With all that in mind we thought it was a fine time to ask experts across TV, music, literature, podcasts and film about what culture they use to send themselves to sleep. Not out of boredom, we should add: these are all legitimately things they enjoy. So hopefully they prove suitably soporific for the insomniacs, and something good to check out for everyone else. *** TV There’s a precise sweet spot to insomnia-banishing TV. Firstly, a show shouldn’t be inherently boring; on some level, it needs to be something you’d watch anyway. But it also shouldn’t have an excess of narrative drive – after all, you’ll soon be drifting in and out of consciousness. And finally, the show must be tonally consistent and visually and sonically soothing. On all of these criteria, BBC nature documentaries score highly. The quality is guaranteed; the format is gently episodic; and the tone, underwritten by long-established grandfather to the nation, David Attenborough, is hot chocolate for the subconscious. As a bonus feature, it’s easy to forget the underlying strangeness of nature. But if you drift off to sleep absorbing footage of bioluminescent marine creatures, billowing clouds of underwater snow and self-cloning crayfish, chances are you’ll have some captivating, borderline-psychedelic dreams. Phil Harrison, TV writer and author of The Age of Static: How TV Explains Modern Britain *** Books As an on-off insomniac, I am addicted to sleep hypnosis recordings. Because these invariably guide you to imagine yourself chilling by the ocean, anything water-themed is now sleep-inducing to me. So one of my favourite bedtime reads is Earth Prayers, a 2024 anthology edited by Carol Ann Duffy, for its hypnotic poems on water and the sea. We have Raymond Carver celebrating rivers; elsewhere, former Makar Kathleen Jamie writes from the perspective of the river Clyde, which describes itself, soporifically, as a “long level / liquid ear gliding slowly by”, listening to the “world’s words”. In Don Paterson’s Parallax, the moon lays “silent on the sea / as on a polished shelf”. Such tranquilising descriptions appear throughout these poems on flowers, animals, and the sky at night. Poetry is, in general, my favourite format to read in bed – wavelike in itself, it feels like the easiest format to dip into when you’re exhausted, the strongest competition against the all-too-seductive bedtime doomscroll. Ella Creamer, Guardian commissioning editor, books and writer of our Bookmarks newsletter *** Music The only time I ever listen to music to go to sleep is on a plane – and always the same record, to induce a sort of Pavlovian surrender. On one hand, William Basinski’s The Disintegration Loops makes perfect sense in that setting. The collection repeats the same orchestral motifs, which lends focus to my wayward mind. The loop gets quieter over the course of the first track’s 63-minute run time, which encourages my brain to wind down, and becomes less obtrusive as sleep hopefully comes on. On the other hand, Basinski completed recording in New York City on 11 September 2001, the album cover features smoke from the twin towers, and he dedicated the album to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. It’s probably the least appropriate thing you could listen to in order to relax while airborne. Works, though. Laura Snapes, Guardian deputy music editor *** Podcasts Seal! Nine Inch Nails! Solange! Lady Gaga! Over the past 11 years, silken-voiced Hrishikesh Hirway has snagged a glut of heavyweights from across the musical spectrum to dissect their hits on his show Song Exploder, unveiling near-unrecognisable demos and coming clean about their quirky behind-the-scenes habits (among them, Rivers Cuomo’s sprawling spreadsheet for Weezer song lyrics, organised by number of syllables). With over 300 episodes, the chances of Hirway having exploded your favourite tune are high, and he’s even covered soundtracks including Severance and Dune. Between our hosts’ silken tones and some of pop’s brightest minds going deep into the teeniest details of their work, I defy you not to be thoroughly mellowed-out. Just don’t pop John Carpenter’s Halloween episode on before bed. Hannah J Davies, Guardian podcast critic *** Film A few years ago, I went to a small stuffy basement room in a cinema to watch a screening of Hirokazu Koreeda’s 1998 film After Life. It was shortly after his 2018 film Shoplifters was released. I, like many others, loved its twisty story about a family where not everything is as it seems. After Life was a different beast. The supernatural story, set in a countryside house that functions as a purgatory of sorts, follows a group of recently deceased people trying to move on. It is, like Koreeda’s other films, beautifully shot, emotionally acute, and full of thoughtful reflections on what it means to be human. It is also perhaps one of the most gentlest things I’ve seen. Full disclosure: I myself didn’t fall asleep, though my boyfriend struggled to stay awake at times. With its unhurried pace, mesmerising cinematography, hushed dialogue and total absence of any sense of danger or melodrama, I could see why.

The service was very slow and we were concerned that we would be late for the theatre.

I was just entering my teens when The Mask came out, and I can still picture myself watching Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls on TV one weekend afternoon, absolutely howling at the silliness of it. His elastic facial expressions, the energy, the stunts – it was the perfect tenor of humour for a young boy. By the time I was in college, I had moved on to his more thoughtful films. The Truman Show was a favourite: still funny, but with a philosophical edge that spoke to me at the time. I loved seeing Carrey stretch into more serious roles, and as the internet made it easier to watch interviews, I came to admire him as a person, too. Which is why, when I found out he was doing a TV series called Kidding, I was thrilled. The idea of him playing a troubled children’s TV presenter was irresistible. I started watching as soon as it came out, not knowing that it would trigger a personal turning point. Around this time, I had started losing my hair. I was in my early 30s, which felt too soon. I thought I might start balding at 50, so I wasn’t mentally prepared. I’d always had thick hair, even wearing it long at university, so when it began to thin, I fought it. I tried combing it over to hide the bald spots, but eventually there was no hiding it. Every time I looked in the mirror I saw what felt like proof that I was getting old too early. It made me feel less attractive, as though something had been taken away from me. Then one night I sat down to watch Kidding. In the very first episode, Carrey’s character is fighting with his controlling father about the direction of his show. In a moment of frustration, he takes a pair of clippers and drags them from his forehead all the way to the back of his skull, ruining his perfect TV hair. I burst out laughing – but I also felt something shift inside me. What he did was was an act of liberation, of taking back control. And suddenly I saw my hair loss for what it was: not just a cosmetic issue, but something I’d let control me. I paused the stream, went to the bathroom, grabbed my beard trimmer and did exactly what Carrey had done. One long line straight down the middle. I looked ridiculous. I laughed for a solid minute, standing there, finally seeing the absurdity of how much energy I’d spent hiding those bald spots. Then I went back to the sofa and finished the episode, still with that stripe across my head. When the credits rolled, I went back and finished the job. It was like a weight had been lifted. The anxiety I’d felt every time I looked in the mirror was gone. I actually thought I looked pretty good. I had a nicely shaped scalp hiding under there! I couldn’t wait to show my friends. When I met them I wore a winter cap and did a dramatic reveal – every single one of them said I looked better shaved. Even my mother, who had struggled with the idea of her once long-haired son being bald, admitted she liked it. These days, I keep my head shaved most of the time, though occasionally I let it grow a bit. Either way, I’m comfortable with how I look. I still have plenty of insecurities – I think that’s normal – but I no longer feel as though I am ageing before my time. I know that there is social stigma around men balding, but I try not to let that affect me. I know that for every woman who prefers a man with a full head of hair, there will be someone out there who likes me the way I am. If I ever met Jim Carrey, I would thank him for teaching me to see myself in a lighter, sillier way. Losing my hair felt like something happening to me, something out of my control. But by laughing at it, by shaving it off on my own terms, I turned it into a choice, and that made all the difference."

What our reviewer said “The chemistry between Brody – still able to trade on the heart-throb status he accrued two decades ago playing beautiful nerd Seth Cohen in The OC – and Bell, who specialises in acid-tongued cool, remains electric.” Rachel Aroesti Read the full review Further reading Tummy-flipping kisses and a chlamydia love story: TV’s best ever romcoms *** Pick of the rest The Ridge BBC iPlayer Summed up in a sentence A hugely layered thriller starring the excellent Lauren Lyle as an anaesthetist who flies to New Zealand for the wedding of her younger sister – only to find her dead.

What our reviewer said “As an entry point to a zany true crime tale, it really is a touchdown.” Hannah J Davies Read the full review The Diplomat Netflix Summed up in a sentence The high-stakes drama stretches credulity but its performances are excellent, its action is tense and its script is highly erudite. What our reviewer said “Keep that disbelief close, and it will feel more like a comedy in places. But keep it at bay, and – much like our own real-world politics – it is a nail-biter.” Hannah J Davies Read the full review *** Film If you only watch one, make it … The Mastermind In cinemas now Summed up in a sentence Josh O’Connor turns art thief in Kelly Reichardt’s unlikely heist movie, which creates a super-naturalistic depiction of an art gallery robbery. What our reviewer said “You wouldn’t expect the quietist, realist movie art of Kelly Reichardt to give us anything like Ocean’s Eleven or Reservoir Dogs. But the very fact of its ostentatiously unadorned reality makes the extraordinary events real and startling, shot, as always with Reichardt, with an earth-tones colour palette in a cold, clear daylight in her unflavoured, unaccented style.” Peter Bradshaw Read the full review Further reading A film about an audacious art heist? Inside The Mastermind, the timeliest movie ever *** Pick of the rest Hedda In cinemas now Summed up in a sentence Nia DaCosta’s adapts Ibsen’s classic play, with Tessa Thompson’s free-spirited but manipulative Hedda marrying for money in 1950s British high society. What our reviewer said “It is ridiculous, intense, despairingly sexual, inspired by Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler and Chekhov’s dictum about the gun produced in act one. It’s a feverish variation on a theme, with twists on gender and racial difference.” Peter Bradshaw Read the full review Further reading ‘She does terrible things’: what can a Marvel director do with Ibsen’s ruthless heroine Hedda Gabler? The Last Sacrifice In cinemas now Summed up in a sentence Fascinating study of how how a gruesome murder spurred the rise of folk-horror, as real life and fiction merged in post-empire Britain in the 1960s and 70s. What our reviewer said “Director Rupert Russell (son of Ken) makes a convincing case that the particulars of the Walton case, and the way its bloodstain permeated out into postwar culture, reflected a particular British insularity, unruliness and furtive violence that still persist today.” Phil Hoad Read the full review The House of Mirth In cinemas now Summed up in a sentence A 25th anniversary re-release of the outstanding 2000 adaptation of Edith Wharton’s novel from the late Terence Davies, with Gillian Anderson as the impecunious socialite Lily Bart in Edwardian-era New York. What our reviewer said “Davies’ signature visual touches are all there: the languorous, unhurried takes on the still-life interiors. But this has been opened out into a substantial, well-upholstered picture with more sinew and power than almost any other period drama of recent times. It gripped me like a thriller throughout.” Peter Bradshaw Read the full review Further reading Master at work: on set with celebrated British film director Terence Davies – in pictures *** Now streaming Stiller &amp; Meara: Nothing Is Lost Apple TV Summed up in a sentence Ben Stiller’s moving documentary about his parents, comedy duo Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, is a tender study on the price a family pay for fame. What our reviewer said “Perhaps Ben has discovered something that Jerry and Meara discovered – but suppressed and kept smiling like the troupers that they were. Show business is a cruel vocation not simply because it takes you away from your family, but because it always promises a level of superstar euphoria that is fleeting, or never arrives at all.” Peter Bradshaw Read the full review *** Books If you only read one, make it … Nobody’s Girl by Virginia Roberts Giuffre Reviewed by Emma Brockes Summed up in a sentence Posthumously published memoir on the impact of Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes.

What our reviewer said “Lyra’s journey into adulthood feels both painful and plausible; Pullman uses her relationship with her daemon to explore her internal struggles in a manner that is unique to his imaginative universe.” Read the full review The Uncool by Cameron Crowe Reviewed by Alex Needham Summed up in a sentence A compulsively readable memoir about interviewing the 70s’ biggest rock stars. What our reviewer said “Crowe shadowed Bowie at parties and in the studio with Iggy Pop; he hung out with him day and night, meaning that he was there to record the heartstopping moment when Bowie jumped to his feet mid-interview because he thought he’d seen a body fall from the sky.” Read the full review I Deliver Parcels in Beijing by Hu Anyan, translated by Jack Hargreaves Reviewed by Joe Moran Summed up in a sentence This viral blog about life as a courier has been a bestseller in China. What our reviewer said “Hu works out that he must earn 0.5 yuan a minute (about 5p) so as not to run his life at a loss, which means completing a delivery every four minutes. The 20 minutes he takes for lunch costs 10 yuan. Urination costs 1 yuan – provided the toilet is free and he only takes two minutes – so he avoids drinking too much water.” Read the full review *** You may have missed … The Land in Winter by Andrew Miller Reviewed by Rachel Seiffert Summed up in a sentence A masterly tale of two couples in a midwinter freeze, shortlisted for the Booker prize.

It makes the ordinary business of living at once very difficult and very necessary.” Read the full review *** Albums If you only listen to one, make it … Lily Allen: West End Girl Out now Summed up in a sentence Allen’s first album in seven years traces the fallout from an open relationship. It’s a gobsmacking autopsy of marital betrayal. What our reviewer said “It’s simultaneously gripping and shocking. There are moments when you find yourself wondering if airing this much dirty laundry can possibly be a good idea, impeccably written and laced with mordant wit though the lyrics are.” Alexis Petridis Read the full review *** Pick of the rest Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra/Domingo Hindoyan: Iberia Out now Summed up in a sentence Addictive Latin rhythms and perfectly judged musical adrenaline in Domingo Hindoyan and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic’s recording of six French works with a Spanish theme.

The results are frequently revelatory, with much that strikes the ear anew.” Clive Paget Read the full review Jennifer Walton: Daughters Out now Summed up in a sentence Fiction, folk and a devastating diagnosis feature in the producer and DJ’s stylish debut.

Here, it’s Arthur Dove paintings that catch the eye of Josh O’Connor’s art thief James Blaine Mooney. ParaNorman Out now An odd dearth of family films has left a gap in the market into which this rerelease of 2012’s animated adventure ParaNorman has decided to slip. Norman Babcock (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is the misfit 11-year-old who speaks with the dead, enabling a spooky adventure to unfold in time for Halloween.

Robert MacBryde and Robert Colquhoun Charleston, East Sussex, to 12 April These hard-living gay painters who met at Glasgow School of Art in 1933 haunt the history of modern British art. For friends such as Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon they were models of artistic bohemianism and avant garde adventure – if not financial success. How does their work hold up today?

He called me over the Tannoy [PA system]: “Could Anal please come to the stage door?” But there must be a bigger word than that. I’m usually good at Countdown. This is quite annoying. This is how I define myself – by my ability to conjure up words from random letters. Is “Nolnaholadra” a word? No. You could have had “handroll” for eight, or “nondollar” for the full nine. Of course! You play Detective Inspector Jack Mooney in Return to Paradise. What’s the closest you’ve come to being arrested? I’m generally quite a law-abiding person. I do remember, at a comedy festival in Montreux in Switzerland, myself and another comedian, Phil Kay, tried to sail across Lake Geneva on somebody else’s boat. We were caught and had to do a runner. Do you have a nemesis? At different times in one’s career, particularly as an actor, it’s not uncommon to have a nemesis. Every time you go for a casting, you find one specific person has been there before you and got the part. Many years ago, it was an Irish guy called Peter McDonald, who’s a really good actor. Bastard. I very much started as a standup, gravitated into sitcom, but when I started paying more attention to more dramatic acting roles, everything I went for, Peter McDonald got. He’s a friend now but, my God, I resented that man. He even turns up [as William Kenzie] in The Batman and The Penguin. What’s been your biggest onstage disaster? I fell asleep on stage once, in this legendary, raucous club called the Empire in Belfast. That was a disaster. It was early in my career. I’d been up all night at a party, got on the train to Belfast and I thought I was fine. I remember thinking I could hear someone doing my material, and getting annoyed. At which point, I woke up and I realised I was on stage. It was an out-of-body experience and quite terrifying. When I started out in comedy, I would wilfully seek out the most difficult gigs in prisons for murderers and thieves and sex offenders. In fairness, the murderers and thieves were great. It was an improv show, so you can imagine some of the suggestions. But the sex offenders I found unpleasant and unrepentant, and I don’t think I helped to rehabilitate [them] in any way. Do you still have any of Father Dougal’s knitted tank tops from Father Ted? I don’t. I regret that. There’s a tiny painting that Father Stone painted of Father Stone and Ted, which I have. Dougal wore an Elvis suit for a lookalike competition. I have that. I asked the costume designer for the tank tops, but I’ve given them away to charities over the years. It’s a pity. I like a tank top but I can’t really be seen wearing them in public. What’s been your most cringeworthy run-in with another celebrity? Van Morrison, a hero of mine, was being honoured in Dublin by Bob Geldof. There was an invited guest list of around 200 people. Van had requested a 25-piece orchestra to play his songs on the night. I was backstage, in the toilet – Van’s toilet – doing my business, when I heard this banging on the door from this very angry man, going [does extreme Irish accent]: “Who’s in my toilet? Get out of my fucking toilet.” I do love Van, but I’m very aware of his crotchety reputation. When I came out, he did vaguely recognise me, and gave me what I can only describe as a very friendly head-butt, like a rutting stag. You star in the music video for Invisible Thread by the Divine Comedy. What would you do if you were invisible for the day? Probably go into everybody’s house on my street and rearrange their shoes. Or is that creepy? You presented an Irish-language show, Inis na nIontas, on [Irish channel] TG4 in 2024, exploring the islands around the coast of Ireland. Where might you like to explore next, and in what language? Japan? But it would have to be in English. My Irish is really not that good. People come up to me on the streets of Ireland and speak to me in Irish, thinking that I’m fluent. I’ve got better Spanish than Irish. So I’d do Japan, in Spanish, with English subtitles. What’s the most out-of-date item in your fridge? During Covid, people took on various challenges and adopted new hobbies. My one nod to that was I made my own sauerkraut. It’s easy to make, but requires discipline and concentration. You shred cabbage, add salt and black peppercorns, or caraway seeds. The shredding is key. You need to shred it very finely. Then you let it ferment for up to a month. I had an ideal version of sauerkraut in my mind from a summer I spent in Germany when I was 18. When I came to eat mine, I didn’t really like it. So that’s still in my fridge, three years on. Would you rather die at the bottom of the sea or deep out into space? I’m slightly afraid of the water. I can swim, but when I was working on Death in Paradise, I almost perished in the Caribbean on two occasions. One weekend off, myself and a few people illicitly chartered a little skiff and sailed to Montserrat, about 100 miles away from Guadeloupe. It was a beautiful sunny Saturday but next morning a hurricane blew up, and 20 foot waves were washing over our tiny boat. We all thought that was it. People were praying and crying. The boat captain had lost his bearings and even he was crying. It really was a really harrowing experience. Another time, my kids had come to visit. They had gone snorkelling and were following some giant turtles out to sea. My wife and I were on the beach. She said: “I think the kids have gone out too far,” so I had to go after them. I only like swimming if I can stand on the bottom, but I could see 200 foot below me and thought: “I’m not going to make it.” So, the answer to your question in short is: space. Return to Paradise series two will start on BBC One in the UK on 31 October and ABC in Australia on 15 November.

culture_2025_oct_27_from-white-teeth-to-swing-time-zadie-smiths-best-books-ranked.txt,culture,2025-10-27,Lisa Allardice,From White Teeth to Swing Time: Zadie Smith’s best books - ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/27/from-white-teeth-to-swing-time-zadie-smiths-best-books-ranked,"8 The Autograph Man (2002) How do you follow a smash hit like White Teeth, which, as everyone now knows, sold for a six-figure sum while the author was still at university, and turned Zadie Smith into a literary superstar and poster girl for multiculturalism at 24? With a novel about a pot-smoking Chinese‑Jewish autograph hunter, the dangers of fame and the shallowness of pop culture, of course. The Autograph Man begins in full wisecracking throttle with three boys in the back of a car on their way to watch a wrestling match between Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks at the Royal Festival Hall. As 12-year-old Alex-Li Tandem gets Big Daddy’s autograph (the start of an obsession), his own daddy drops dead from a brain tumour. Unfortunately, the rest of the novel doesn’t quite live up to the prologue. The critical heavyweights of the time didn’t pull their punches: “A poky, pallid successor” (Michiko Kakutani, who had rapturously reviewed White Teeth, in the New York Times), “cartoonish” and full of “misplaced ironies and grinning complicities” (James Wood in the LRB). Others were more generous. Whatever. Smith was just getting stuff out the way. 7 The Wife of Willesden (2021) Given Smith’s talent for dialogue, it was only a matter of time before she wrote a play. Her first, and only, work for the stage is a riotous reworking of The Wife of Bath’s Tale from Canterbury Tales, transported to an open-mic night at a pub on the Kilburn High Road. Chaucer’s Alyson becomes Alvita, a five-times married Jamaican-born British woman in her mid-50s. Her voice, “brash, honest, cheeky, salacious, outrageous, unapologetic is one I’ve heard and loved all my life”, Smith writes in the introduction. “She’s been that bitch since 1983,” the audience is told. First performed at Kilburn’s Kiln theatre, it transferred to the National in London (you can still watch it on their website) and to New York. Bawdy and brave, here is a woman speaking her truth down the centuries. 6 The Fraud (2023) Smith’s first foray into historical fiction is based on the Tichborne trial of 1873, when an East End-born butcher living in Australia claimed to be the long-lost heir to a fortune. She found the story on her doorstep: the scamster is buried in an unmarked grave in Willesden, where the novel, like nearly all Smith’s fiction, is set. With its dangerous populist hero, peddling conspiracy theories and fake news, this Victorian drama has plenty of contemporary resonances. The writing is as smart and assured as ever. Many critics loved it. But, perhaps because it rests on plot (never Smith’s strongest point) rather than character, for me the novel lacks the flesh-and-blood vitality of her earlier fiction. We read Smith to show us how we live now. 5 Swing Time (2016) “I wanted to express how it is to be in the world as a black woman,” Smith said of her more sombre fifth novel. In 1982, two little girls from neighbouring estates meet at a dance class in a Willesden church hall. Reinvention, celebrity, motherhood and – ahead of its time – cultural appropriation are all touched upon in a novel that zigzags deftly through time and place. Smith is at her sharpest on the subtle codes of class and race. From Barbies and the Argos catalogue to goths and MTV, she captures growing up in the 80s and 90s, to a soundtrack of Michael Jackson and Rakim. If the social commentary becomes a little heavy-footed at times, the central story of female friendship, in all its jealousies, rivalries and betrayals, never falters. 4 NW (2012) Childhood loyalties and the conflicting yearnings for freedom and belonging are also at the heart of Smith’s most experimental novel. It is fair to say that critical opinion was divided: “clunky”, “weirdly contrived”, with “paper doll characters”, sniped Kakutani again; “a joyous, optimistic, angry masterpiece”, “her best”, cried others. Set in north-west London – obviously – NW covers familiar Smith territory, but with the spirit of Woolf rather than Dickens on her shoulder. The optimism of her early fiction has been replaced by “existential bleakness”, in Smith’s words. If you read novels to know what things feel like, what the author calls “the concrete ‘thingyness’ of people”, rather than for what happens, you will sink into the thirtysomething lives of Leah and Natalie against the Kilburn summer of 2010. If not, move on. Magnificent in parts; infuriating as a whole. 3 Feel Free: Essays (2018) In the UK we are suspicious of the essay form – too intellectually showy, perhaps – whereas in the US it is a badge of distinction; all the cool writers are at it. Thank goodness, then, for Smith, who has emerged as one of our liveliest thinkers as well as storytellers. The subjects in this collection range from Justin Bieber to Brexit, Jay-Z to Hanif Kureishi, Joni Mitchell to Schopenhauer, the climate emergency, her childhood bathroom, and joy, all corralled by a formidable intellect and wit. Here is Smith thinking on the page about the things that matter most to her (books, music, film, injustice, freedoms of one kind or another). Be warned: reading Smith’s essays will make you realise you have floated through life with the critical acuity of an amoeba. But you will emerge better for it. And she is always great company. A new collection, Dead and Alive, is out this month. 2 White Teeth (2000) “White Teeth is the literary equivalent of a hyperactive, ginger-haired tap-dancing 10-year-old,” Smith herself, then anonymously and now famously, opined in the small literary magazine Butterfly. Everyone else was busy comparing her to Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie, Hanif Kureishi and even Dickens. This noisy, sunny story of two second world war veterans, best friends Archie Jones from Reading and Samad Iqbal, a Bengali Muslim, and their extended families, who have fetched up in Willesden, turned out to be the novel everyone was waiting for. Smith arrived with a voice that was at once funny, fearless, philosophical and hip, and which was perfectly suited to the hopefulness of a new millennium: publishing’s answer to Cool Britannia. While the plot is slightly preposterous, the author was clearly preposterously talented. Twenty-five years later, White Teeth remains a landmark of British fiction. 1 On Beauty (2005) “One may as well begin with Jerome’s emails to his father,” begins Smith’s third novel, to signal that what follows is a reworking of EM Forster’s classic Howards End. What chutzpah! Two families, the liberal Belseys and the establishment Kippses (Forster’s Schlegels and Wilcoxes), from New England and Kilburn respectively, become fatefully intertwined. Art, faith, rap, race, pain and death are all wrapped up in a comic campus novel and bravura literary homage. On Beauty is the only Smith novel to have been shortlisted for the Booker prize (how is that?); it won the Orange, now Women’s prize. Martin Amis said he read everything by Smith “with a constant smile of admiration”; this book makes your face ache. Much is made of the precocity of White Teeth. Smith was only 30 (the same age as Forster) when she pulled off this erudite, expansive and affecting novel. The author turns 50 this month.

I went on holiday and Dave Cummings, who’d written for Harry Enfield and Chums, did the first draft. I came back and took over. A month later, it was all happening. It was really quick. We were given a few million to shoot over 12 days in Ibiza. The nightclub scenes were all filmed in one day and night at Amnesia. The scene in which Kevin and Perry get puked on by some clubbers was filmed in the afternoon. We invented the Inbetweeners basically! They couldn’t shut the club in the evening, so the crowd weren’t extras. They were actual clubbers, having a good night, and the DJs were actually DJing. I said to DJs Seb Fontaine and Roger Sanchez: “Do you mind if I just come and interrupt your set?” When I was that age, it was punk. We’d go and see the Clash and the Pistols. They’d be horrible to us and we’d go: “Brilliant!” I once asked Pistols drummer Paul Cook: “Can you write something funny on my trousers?” So he wrote: “Something funny.” Eyeball Paul, the character played by Rhys Ifans, is our equivalent: the nastier he is to us, the more we like him. The notorious scene in which poo goes into my mouth wasn’t in the script. Originally it was a scene where Kevin and Perry went on a boat trip with the girls, who all ignored them. But when we got to the jetty to film it, there was no sign of the boat. Ed Bye, the director, said: “What the fuck are we going to do?” We had to think of something else. I’d been swimming at the same beach a few years before and there had been a great big human poo next to me. I said: “Get a bit of polystyrene, paint it brown, put some sweetcorn on it like eyes and pull it with fishing line so it looks like it’s going in my mouth. And Kathy, you go in the water and look like you’ve just shat in the sea.” The film is fun and silly, but quite sweet because you feel sorry for Kevin and Perry. It’s very English. When they screened it in America, people hated it so much they wanted to burn the cinema down. In France, the poster read: “Kevin et Perry, un film trash.” I’m a bit too old for a sequel now. I did once write Kevin and Perry Go to Wizard School, but nobody ever replied. That’s the English film industry, I’m afraid. Kathy Burke, played Perry I’d been one of Harry Enfield’s “Chums”, playing Waynetta Slob, Lulu the Toddler and Perry. I’d just won the 1997 best actress award in Cannes for Nil By Mouth when Harry said he might be able to get funds for a Kevin and Perry movie. Was I up for it? I thought: “Too right, mate!” I left the script to Harry and Dave Cummings. Louisa Rix continued in her role as Kevin’s mum, Mrs Patterson. Perry and Mrs Patterson have this little twinkle between them: Perry is very much in lust with Mrs Patterson and she is very much in amusement with him. It was always great fun working with Louisa. Since we were playing a couple of hormonal, randy teenagers, Harry and I were fitted with electronic penises that worked by remote control. Sexy ladies walked past and – boing! – up went the appendages. The crew were a lively bunch too, and we’d congregate in a bar at the end of a day’s filming and drink Choccy-Woccy, a lethal brandy, vodka and milk chocolate concoction that Rhys Ifans invented. It went down far too easily yet for some reason caused minimal hangovers. When we did the press circuit, I was surprised by how many journalists asked if this kind of comedy movie was maybe a bit lowbrow. Most of the parts I’d been offered since Cannes were extremely boring – just carbon copies of my previous roles. As a woman in my mid-30s, when else would I have the opportunity to play a 14-year-old boy? It’s surprising but very lovely that, nearly 30 years on, people still talk to me about Kevin and Perry. They hold a special place in some old hearts. As Perry would say: “Fank yoo!” • Harry Enfield and No Chums begins touring in March. A Mind of My Own by Kathy Burke is published by Gallery Books"
culture_2025_oct_27_steve-coogan-to-pay-damages-to-defamed-academic.txt,culture,2025-10-27,Caroline Davies,Steve Coogan says Richard III film was ‘story I wanted to tell’ as he agrees to libel settlement,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/27/steve-coogan-to-pay-damages-to-defamed-academic,"Steve Coogan has said his film about the discovery of the remains of Richard III was “the story I wanted to tell, and I am happy I did” after he and two production companies agreed to pay “substantial damages” to settle a high court libel claim over the film’s portrayal of a senior university administrator. Richard Taylor, deputy registrar at the University of Leicester at the time of the find, sued Coogan, his production company Baby Cow, and Pathe Productions for libel over his portrayal in the 2022 film The Lost King, which follows the amateur historian Philippa Langley and her search for the king’s skeleton. Taylor’s lawyers had asserted previously that he was portrayed in the film as “devious”, “weasel-like” and a “suited bean-counter”. Judge Lewis had ruled previously that the film portrayed Taylor as having “knowingly misrepresented facts to the media and the public” about the find, and as being “smug, unduly dismissive and patronising”, which had a defamatory meaning. The case was due to proceed to trial, but lawyers for Taylor read an agreed statement to the court on Monday saying the parties had settled the claim. William Bennett, KC for Taylor, told the court: “Mr Taylor contended that the depiction of him in this untrue way in the film caused serious harm to his professional and personal reputations and caused enormous distress and embarrassment to him.” As well as paying substantial damages, the defendants had also agreed to pay his legal costs, and make an onscreen clarification stating that the portrayal of Taylor was “fictional and does not represent the actions of the real Mr Taylor”, and that he “acted with integrity during the events portrayed”. After the hearing, Langley said on her website that she had intended to appear as a witness for the defendants at trial as she wanted a judge to “independently come to a decision in this matter”, but was unable to do so due to ill health. Coogan said in a statement he would have “preferred” for a judge to rule on the case, and it was “unfortunate” due to Langley’s ill health they were unable to put evidence before the court, and that the film was “Philippa Langley’s story”. He said Langley had instigated the search for Richard III, insisted on the dig in the area of the car park where the remains were found and raised the majority of the money for his exhumation. “If it wasn’t for Philippa Langley, Richard III would still be lying under a car park in Leicester. It is her name that will be remembered in relation to the discovery of the lost king, long after Richard Taylor has faded into obscurity.” “That is the story I wanted to tell, and I am happy I did.” Coogan, Baby Cow and Pathe were not represented in court and did not attend. In the film, Taylor, played by Lee Ingleby, is shown as antagonistic towards Langley, played by Sally Hawkins, who spearheads the dig and is sidelined by academics when they seek to take credit for the discovery. Langley’s husband is played by Coogan, who co-wrote the script with Jeff Pope. In 2022, Taylor told the BBC: “I’m portrayed as kind of a bullying, cynical, double-crossing, devious manipulator, which is bad, but then when you add to that I behave in a sexist way and a way that seems to mock Richard III’s disabilities, you start to get into the realm of defamation.” Bennett said in his statement to the court that Langley “caused the remains to be found by driving forward a project to search for them” in the car park in Leicester city centre more than 500 years after the monarch’s death. He said the University of Leicester had also played a “crucial role in providing funds and academic expertise” for the project, with Taylor the “key coordinator of the university’s involvement”. Speaking outside court, Taylor, now chief operating officer at Loughborough University, said he had felt “cross” and “completely helpless” when the film was released. He said the outcome of his libel case represented “success and vindication” after “a long and gruelling battle”. Taylor said Langley’s initiation of the project and “driving confidence” had made it possible for Richard III to be found. He added: “Hers was a remarkable contribution. But it did not extend to leading the archaeological search or scientific analysis, for which she was neither qualified nor experienced. “There have been moments over the last three years when I thought, when Philippa Langley approached me for the university’s support, I perhaps should have put the request in the bin, but I didn’t, and I think I was right not to do that. “It was a fantastic piece of academic work involving volunteers, involving the Richard III Society, involving academics, from many, many universities, on an international scale. I think it’s a truly remarkable discovery, a really strong piece of teamwork.” A joint statement from Coogan, Pathe and Baby Cow said: “As a distributor and producer recognised for bringing complex, real-life stories to audiences, we are deeply aware of the responsibility that comes with such portrayals and approach each project with care, integrity, and a commitment to authenticity. “We remain incredibly proud of this film and are pleased this matter has now been settled.” • This article was amended on 28 October 2025 to remove references to Richard Taylor as an academic. He was a senior university administrator at the time."
culture_2025_oct_28_jon-stewart-trump-third-term-white-house-demolition.txt,culture,2025-10-28,Guardian staff,Jon Stewart on Trump’s taunts of an illegal third term: ‘We know he’s thought about it’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/28/jon-stewart-trump-third-term-white-house-demolition,"Late-night hosts reacted to Donald Trump’s taunts about an illegal third presidential term and his demolition of the East Wing of the White House. Jon Stewart From his Monday night post on the Daily Show, Jon Stewart assessed the threat of Trump attempting to run for a third term as president, which is illegal under the 22nd amendment to the constitution. Asked by reporters for his thoughts on comments by Steve Bannon that he had a plan for such a campaign, Trump answered: “I would love to do it ... I have my best numbers ever.” He also claimed, however: “I haven’t really thought about it.” “That’s the tell for whenever he’s asked about something that he is definitely going to do that is dubious legally, ethically or morally,” Stewart noted. “He says he hasn’t thought about it. But of course we know he’s thought about it because he already has the merch,” he added, pointing to “Trump 2028” hats that Trump has displayed in the Oval Office. “What’s interesting about Trump is he’s actually worked through the various scenarios of running for a third term that he has not thought about,” said Stewart, pointing to Trump’s further comments that “I think the people wouldn’t like that. It’s too cute.” “Too cute? No, that’s why you don’t go to Build-a-Bear as an adult,” Stewart replied. “Running as the vice-president to skirt the 22nd amendment isn’t cute. But he’s the kinda guy who’s like ‘I respect Americans too much to play games. If I’m going to run again, I’m going to rip off the constitution’s head and shit down its neck.’ “Indications are very clear he’s gonna do it,” he continued, “because you don’t move into a house, knock down a wing and build a 90,000-sq-ft ballroom for the next guy. “Trump’s not a house-flipper,” he added. “He’s not Ellen. He’s in it for the long haul.” Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel returned from a weeklong family trip to Ireland with renewed perspective on his home country. “In case you’re wondering what people in other countries think about what’s going on here in our country, I’ll tell you: they’re worried about us,” he said. “They’re very worried. They’re worried about us in the same way you worry about a nephew who you maybe haven’t seen for a few years and he shows up at Thanksgiving missing all of his front teeth? That kind of worry.” People in Ireland, Kimmel reported, had a lot of questions for him about Trump, including: “Why is he knocking down part of the White House?” “I don’t know. Nobody knows,” he answered. “I don’t think he even knows. “Back here at home, the unrest continues to rage out of control. Antifa terrorists are destroying government – oh wait, that’s the White House,” Kimmel joked over a photo of the demolished East Wing. “That’s what Trump did on purpose, without permission, to the White House. I told you we should’ve made him put down a security deposit!” Nevertheless, Trump’s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, defended the move on NBC News: “I think this was a judgment call by the president. The president is a master builder. I don’t know, I assume that maybe parts of the East Wing, there could’ve been asbestos, there could’ve been mold. “There could’ve been some old Chinese food, could’ve been ghosts! We don’t know,” Kimmel joked. “All we know is that the only solution was to completely smash the whole place down. I wish the master builder would master-build in private like the rest of us do.” Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also touched on the Trump 2028 hats seen on his desk during meetings with congressional Democrats. “It’s so weird to make a hat for a thing that can’t happen,” said Meyers. “Wearing a Trump 2028 hat is like wearing a hat that says Super Bowl champion New York Jets.” “So Trump put some hats on the desk during a meeting with Democrats,” he continued, “and the Democrats in attendance definitely thought it was weird.” As the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told CNN: “it was the strangest thing ever.” “Come on, the strangest thing ever? Don’t you live Brooklyn?” Meyers laughed. “If someone Rollerbladed into a Brooklyn deli wearing a full mermaid costume, the only thing anyone would say is ‘the usual, Jeff?’ “It’s not even the strangest thing Trump has done,” he continued. “Not long before that meeting, he wandered on to the roof of the White House. “Think about how insane this is: this was supposed to be a meeting about keeping the government open, making sure troops get paid and families get nutrition assistance and air traffic controllers can do their jobs,” Meyers added. “And instead the president’s main interest was trolling. “Trump can’t help himself,” he concluded. “The Maga movement cares more about trolling libs than making government function, which is why he keeps going on about this unconstitutional third term.” Stephen Colbert “It was a beautiful day here in America because Donald Trump was out of the country,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. To start the week, Trump was on a “field trip” to Asia, where “he’s going to tear down the Great Wall and put up a ballroom,” Colbert quipped. The trip includes stops in Japan, South Korea and Malaysia, where Trump danced to a marching band in a way that Colbert could only describe as “shuffling and swinging his wrists like a low-battery Chuck E Cheese robot”. In Japan, the new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, reportedly planned to gift Trump a gold golf ball. “It is so sad to see how easy it is to butter up the president of the United States,” Colbert remarked. “OK quick, Trump’s visiting, what are we going to get him this time? Gold burger? Gold TV? Have we tried spray-painting a woman gold?” Colbert also touched on the fourth week of the ongoing government shutdown. “The longer it goes, the more used to having no government we get and then the less likely it is to ever end,” he said. The shutdown is now restricting military pay. But on Friday, an anonymous donor – later identified as Timothy Mellon – gifted $130m to pay troops during the shutdown. “I know that sounds nice, I get it, but I don’t like the idea of the armed forces having a private sponsor,” Colbert said. “I don’t want our next invasion to be code-named ‘Operation Chili’s New El Diablo Triple Dipper Rib Tips: Can You Stand the Heat?’”"

Richard Taylor, formerly deputy registrar at the University of Leicester, sued Coogan as well as the film’s production company, Baby Cow, and the distributor Pathé over his portrayal in the 2022 film about the discovery of Richard III’s remains in a Leicester car park. The parties reached a settlement requiring damages, a clarification to appear on the film, and an undertaking not to repeat the defamatory claims. A judge had found Taylor was shown in an “unrelentingly negative and defamatory” light. Taylor said Ofcom needed “clearer guidance” to stop similar misrepresentations happening in future. “They have a lot to say about news accuracy but much less about fact-based drama, which sits in a grey area,” he said. “Ofcom should tighten that so people like me don’t have to rush off to the libel courts when nonsense like The Lost King happens.” Regarding fact-based drama, he added: “Not every single scene has got to be true, not every single conversation has got to be true, but if you’re presenting it as a true story, it has got to be substantially true. And if it’s not, you need to change the names of characters, change the names of organisations in it and tell the story in a very different way than if you are claiming it is a true story.” While stressing he did not want to “tie writers up in knots”, Taylor said the case should prompt Ofcom to act. “This outcome is potentially quite challenging for people writing these dramas now … but Ofcom stepping in would be helpful.” Reflecting on the settlement, Taylor said he felt “relieved and happy, regretful that I ever needed” to bring the case, but that he remained frustrated that the film would continue to be shown. “I’d rather it was edited. I’d rather the whole film was withdrawn,” he said. Under the settlement, a statement must appear for at least five seconds after the title card, clarifying that the “Mr Taylor” depicted is a fictionalised character. “In effect, the film’s going to have to say: ‘based on a true story, but actually the main villain is completely made up because the real guy [of the same name] was acting with integrity’. I think that’s going to make the film pretty ridiculous.” Taylor, now chief operating officer at Loughborough University, also criticised the film-makers for “not checking the facts” about events shown in the film. He said that, before the film’s release, Coogan and his collaborators “didn’t take me seriously” when he raised concerns about being misrepresented. “My view is that they were dismissive,” he said. “Steve Coogan’s never anything other than certain of his own righteousness, and I think he still thinks he was right in doing this.” Coogan said in a statement that he would have “preferred” for a judge to rule on the case, and that he was “happy” with the story the film told. Taylor said the film-makers had failed to verify basic details, including claims that he had excluded The Lost King’s protagonist, Philippa Langley, from press conferences. “If you’re told Philippa was excluded, you go and check that,” he said. “There’s video on YouTube showing her quite clearly speaking at all of them. They didn’t check the facts.” Taylor described the experience of being falsely portrayed in a film as “really hurtful”, adding: “The problem is you don’t know what people are saying about you, do you? My integrity is really important to me.” “I feel I should never have been in that position and to do all of that over a portrayal that was false,” he said. “For the last three years it’s been … moments where it’s really quite intense and you feel quite anxious, quite stressed, quite worried.” A joint statement from Pathe Productions, Baby Cow Productions and Steve Coogan said: “As a distributor and producer recognised for bringing complex, real-life stories to audiences, we are deeply aware of the responsibility that comes with such portrayals and approach each project with care, integrity, and a commitment to authenticity. “We remain incredibly proud of this film and are pleased this matter has now been settled.” • The subheading of this article was amended on 29 October 2025 to correct the name of the film to The Lost King, not The Last King."

Jimmy Kimmel On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the comedian checked in on Trump’s visit to Japan this week. “You know, when Trump visits, you have to find something to do with him,” he said. “You can’t just take him for a stroll around town. “So instead, you take him for a stroll inside a palace, where he gets uncomfortably close to the band,” he said over footage of Trump wandering aimlessly through a ballroom with the Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. “It’s like he’s lost at the mall.” Takaichi later joined Trump on the USS Washington, where she “got to hear him ramble to our troops about a range of subjects, including magnets”, Kimmel reported. “He hates magnets, windmills and sharks. But he loves steam,” as the president went on and on about the steam-powered aircraft carriers, and said he would revert to steam power via executive order. “While Trump’s slurping noodles in Japan, we’re on day 28 of his big, beautiful government shutdown,” Kimmel added. In Washington, the speaker of the house, Mike Johnson, maintained that there was nothing Trump could do about the shutdown. “The guy who’s ended eight wars, a man who ended wars that never even started, can’t do anything about this?” Kimmel marveled. Johnson’s apathetic stance has angered even far-right members of his own party, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, who reportedly lashed out at him on a private phone call and demanded to see the Republican plan for healthcare. Johnson refused, “because there is no Republican plan for healthcare”, said Kimmel. “The reason Mike Johnson won’t share the plan for healthcare is the same reason George Santos won’t show you his volleyball trophies: they do not exist.” Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert started by thanking “the wonderful people of Japan” for “taking in our president for a few days, so the rest of us can just have a little break”. “Japan is trying to get on Trump’s good side to escape his random tariff spree,” by giving fireworks and 250 cherry trees to the US. “Or, as it will be known in history books: how Eric Trump started the DC wildfires,” Colbert joked. Trump, as commander in chief, also visited with American troops stationed in Japan, and “he announced a new military target: it’s you.” As Trump put it: “We can’t have cities that are troubled, we’re sending in our national guard, and we need more than the national guard … because we’re going to have safe cities.” “There it is, in plain English, telling the military he’s going to use them to invade America,” Colbert reiterated. “But just a warning to the troops: that country is run by a madman, OK? It will take you years to install a democracy by this point. “And those American cities better watch out,” he added, “because according to Trump, our military is set to go GI Joe.” Trump continued: “Nobody makes equipment like we do, nobody makes the ammunition, the weapons, the missiles, planes, none of it. And if they do, the American sailor stands ready to crush them and sink them and wreck them and blast them into oblivion.” “Inspiring words,” Colbert deadpanned. Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers began with Trump’s claim this week that he was getting “the best polling numbers I’ve ever received”. “I don’t know if the people around you are showing the real numbers,” Meyers responded. “Did the newspaper they showed you also have a picture of Stephen Miller as a sheriff?” Trump and Melania will reportedly host a Halloween celebration at the White House on Thursday, “but it looks like they already left their jack-o’-lantern out too long”, Meyers joked next to a photo of an over tanned Robert F Kennedy, Jr. The White House also posted a timeline in defense of its harshly criticized East Wing demolition that “features so-called major events that took place at the White House”, Meyers said, including the supposed “discovery” of cocaine in the White House during the Biden presidency. “OK, but it clearly wasn’t his,” said Meyers next to a photo of Biden sleeping at his desk. “Look at him – he’s like the bear they put on tea.” And Tesla issued a recall for more than 63,000 Cybertrucks because the front lights are too bright. “Apparently, you can see people laughing at you from up to 300 yards away,” Meyers quipped."

ACE’s online portal, Grantium, was used by artists to submit and manage funding applications. But when it crashed in July, it left thousands of applications for vital funding in doubt – a situation that persisted for several months until applications reopened in late September. Individual artists and leaders of arts institutions have said that, after the crash, they received less money than initially offered by ACE, which is also accused of revoking funding application extensions for organisations affected by the collapse of the portal. ACE claimed the outage was caused by the inability of Grantium to operate with high traffic at a time when the system was being updated. The arms-length arts funder currently distributes about £500m of public money and more than £250m of national lottery money annually, while employing 650 people. Grantium launched in 2016 and was heralded as a system that would “help to bring [ACE] into the 21st century”. It was supposed to cut out the bureaucracy of the old paper-based system, be “fit for purpose” and create estimated annual savings of £1m for ACE. But many people the Guardian spoke to described chaos and confusion in the aftermath of the Grantium shutdown. Pui-Ka Cheng is the writer, director and fundraiser for Drift, an ACE-funded project that had performances at the Lowry’s Aldridge Studio in Salford earlier this month. Drift received approval from Grantium on 17 July, according to Cheng. But she encountered difficulties in submitting her bank account details shortly afterwards. When Grantium started having problems, Cheng sent numerous emails, made phone calls and submitted inquiries through the ACE website “without receiving proper assistance. Unfortunately, we only received incorrect links in response.” She added: “We have not received any funding from the Arts Council. Consequently, none of our team members have received artist fees and I have had to cover all expenses from my personal savings.” Grantium has been criticised for years by those who have to use it. In May 2024, an open letter was sent to Dame Mary Archer, who was at that time heading a review into ACE, which is now led by Margaret Hodge. Figures including Shakespeare’s Globe chief executive, Stella Kanu, Actors Touring Company boss, Matthew Xia, and Live Theatre artistic director, Jack McNamara, called for a “transformation” of Grantium to make the grant process more “streamlined, equitable and transparent”. Pepa Duarte, an actor and theatre maker in London, said the outage caused problems for a £28,000 grant she received from ACE for her touring exhibition Sharing Ingredients. Duarte said ACE ended up underpaying her by £1,500 – money that would have covered her rent. Grantium collapsed when Duarte was due to file her final report, which includes income and expenditure, and is needed before the final payment is received from ACE. After weeks of being unable to submit her report, Duarte was asked to do it all manually in a Word document. “I had to put my expenditure in line by line,” she said. “You can imagine, with the amount of money these grants signify, trying to do it like that. I had nothing to support the maths of it all.” Duarte said that previously ACE would assist if an error was made or the final report missed, but after the Grantium crash, she struggled to get replies from ACE, which eventually claimed she had underspent and therefore her final payment was lowered. “The difference in the money they’re not paying me might be very little for them, but for me it’s two or three months of rent,” she said. “Artists shouldn’t be paying the price for the chaos they’ve found themselves in.” Other arts professionals have described a “cruel” bureaucratic process where they seemed to be punished because of the extra workload caused by the Grantium crash. Jo Hunter, the co-founder and chief executive of 64 Million Artists, the Gloucestershire-based arts provider, told the Guardian her organisation had been given an extension to apply for grant funding this summer. But after the Grantium crash, the organisation was told that extension had been revoked, meaning that the company – which is closing its public arm – had to rethink the final few months of its programme and look elsewhere for funding. “It was a ‘computer says no’ moment in which no one could seem to interrupt the system,” she said. The musician Brian Eno eventually stepped in and donated £10,000 but many organisations haven’t been as fortunate. Since the Grantium outage, arts unions have worked to highlight the impact the crash created for artists. In August, Equity said the “system meltdown is just the latest in a litany of governance failures. Every time it is struggling artists who pay the price.” Reaction to ACE’s new system and whether it offers an improvement on Grantium, has been mixed. Daniel Bernstein, the chief executive of Emergency Exit Arts, said the system “feels clunkier”. Last month, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said there would be no extra financial support available to overhaul ACE’s grant application system. “It is a matter for them,” Nandy said. “We didn’t get additional money in the spending review to give them a new system.” An Arts Council England spokesperson said: “Following the technical issues we experienced over the summer, we devised new application processes to ensure artists and organisations could access our funding as straightforwardly as possible. We’re sorry for the disruption caused by the original outage and grateful for the patience applicants showed as we worked to put alternatives in place. These are now up and running, and working well. “Since that point, we have made over 3,900 grant payments totalling over £203m to individuals and organisations around the country. When delivering any grant funding at this sort of scale, it’s invariably the case that a small number of applicants will encounter some issues. Whenever this happens, we work as quickly as we can to put this right, so applications are processed and payments are made as swiftly as possible.”"

Seth Meyers Trump continued his tour of Asia on Wednesday, where he’s been “getting the royal treatment he so desperately craves”, according to Seth Meyers. “He wishes he could get the same treatment back here at home. He made it clear, for example, that he’s super-jealous of China’s authoritarian government.” Speaking to South Korean leaders, Trump assured them that the country’s partnership with the US guaranteed that “you’ll have everything done very, very quickly … as fast as any other country, other than China”, because China “has a good system” where Xi Jinping can “approve things immediately” whereas he had to “wait two weeks”. “I’m sorry, you have to wait to two weeks?” the Late Night host mocked. “I thought you were going to say two years. For the rest of us, two weeks is very fast. Have you ever tried to make a dentist appointment? I chipped a tooth once, and they asked me if I was available to come in December 2027, and I just said ‘fuck it’ and let the tooth fall out.” Trump also said that he stuffed the so-called big, beautiful bill to the gills so that he would never have to work with Congress again. “That’s how democracy works. You’re supposed to get the approval of Congress,” said Meyers. “For example, you can’t just bomb boats wherever the hell you want – that’s illegal and unconstitutional. And that’s not just me saying that. That’s coming from Republicans.” Speaking on Fox News, Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, called Trump’s bombing of alleged drug traffickers off the coast of South America “extrajudicial killings” that were “akin to what China does, what Iran does with drug dealers”. “Of course, when you say this is how China does it, that just makes Trump love it even more,” Meyers said, laughing. “He’s like: ‘I don’t want to blow up a boat in two weeks. I want to do it now!’” Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also checked in on Trump’s Asia trip. “He’s still flying around the world right now, collecting gifts wherever he goes,” he said. “He’s like reverse Santa, because you want to stay as far away from his lap as possible.” On Wednesday, Trump’s tour of Asia “took him to his second favorite Korea: south”, where he was greeted by a South Korean military band playing YMCA. “I know that’s kinda his song, at this point, but it really undercuts the gravity of an official presidential occasion,” Colbert remarked. “I’m not going to say the Koreans brown-nosed him, but they got so far up there I’m pretty sure they snorted one of his tonsils. Because they gave Donald Trump the only thing he’s missing at this point: a big golden crown.” Their official lunch also featured mini beef patties with ketchup. “They’re literally making him the Burger King!” Colbert quipped. Trump’s day ended with a dinner alongside fellow world leaders, including the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney. Trump then posted on Truth Social: “We didn’t come to Korea to see Canada!” Colbert retorted: “Well, we also didn’t come to South Korea to eat burger patties with ketchup, but that’s just traveling with a toddler for you.” Jimmy Kimmel “Just about every day I have a moment where I think, ‘Man, things are terrible,’” said Jimmy Kimmel. “The government has been shut down for like a month. The Republicans are trying to force Congress to choose between healthcare and food to open it up. We’ve got a bunch of ghouls running the country, prices are high, people are suffering. And just when you start to think, ‘Wow, it couldn’t get any worse than this,’ God throws a curveball like this one.” That would be the frantic search for research monkeys that escaped the wreckage of a truck crash in Mississippi. Authorities warned that the six escaped monkeys could be aggressive toward humans, and could be potentially infected with hepatitis C, herpes or Covid. “Hepatitis, herpes and Covid?! Who are these monkeys hanging out with, Charlie Sheen?” Kimmel joked. Meanwhile, “there’s an angry orangutan on the loose in South Korea”, said Kimmel, as “President Furious George was in Chungju today as part of his Asia-palooza tour. And they’re keeping him happy by giving him presents everywhere he goes.” Including, of course, the golden crown. “How nice,” Kimmel deadpanned. “I guess they were watching millions of us marching saying we didn’t want a king and they thought, ‘Hey, I have a great idea for a gift.’ “It’s so embarrassing how easy he is to manipulate,” he added. “It’s like when you give kids Pokémon cards to get them to behave.”"
culture_2025_oct_31_stephen-colbert-ex-prince-andrew.txt,culture,2025-10-31,Guardian staff,Stephen Colbert on ex-prince Andrew: ‘Pervert formerly known as prince’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/31/stephen-colbert-ex-prince-andrew,"Late-night hosts spoke about Donald Trump’s trip to Asia and how he refuses to accept criticism while also reacting to ex-prince Andrew being stripped of his royal title. Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke about Trump’s recent trip to parts of Asia, including South Korea where he negotiated tariffs with Xi Jinping, China’s president. Colbert played awkward footage of the two in front of cameras, adding that he was “not confident we’re gonna win this one”. The talks ended up with both sides agreeing to what amounted to a pre-tariff status quo yet Trump has been “telling everyone he won the negotiations big time” saying that he would rank the meeting as a 12 out of 10. Colbert joked that he “must have been insufferable as a teenager” telling friends he went to 14th base with girls which means “over the bra, under the hat”. This week also saw Kash Patel, the FBI director, take the FBI’s private jet to go on a date, “a stunning ethical violation” that saw him take his 26-year-old girlfriend to a wrestling match which was part of an unscripted wrestling league founded by Hulk Hogan. He remarked that it “does not sound like the most romantic date”. Colbert said that there are “many signs that America has hit a bit of a rough patch” but this week the country hit “rock bottom” with the announcement that viral teen slang 6-7 has become 2025’s word of the year, according to Dictionary.com. He said the “word of the year has to be a word” and joked that it was like the time that Playboy announced its playmate of the year as 8. Reportedly, schoolteachers begged those at Dictionary.com not to make it the word of the year but Colbert added: “Don’t worry teachers if anything will kill this trend it’s being mentioned here on CBS.” He moved on to ex-prince Andrew, “the guy who used to hang out with Jeffrey Epstein who’s not Donald Trump” who has just been stripped of his royal title. Colbert spoke about the controversial email that was the “royal straw that broke the peasant’s back” adding that “maybe men shouldn’t have friends”. He joked that his new title will be “pervert formerly known as prince”. Jimmy Kimmel On Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host spoke about Halloween at the White House, which saw Trump give children candy as well as Be Best postcards. “I didn’t know Be Best was still a thing,” he said. Kimmel also spoke about his trip to parts of Asia, joking that “he avoided Vietnam just for old time’s sake”. Trump has also been testing nuclear weapons again which Kimmel claimed was a response to him losing the Nobel peace prize as next time he is “gonna take it by force”. It’s now been a month of government shutdown which has led to infighting within the Republican party such as vocal anger from Marjorie Taylor Greene, a surprise to many. Kimmel said she was someone “who didn’t just drink the Kool-Aid, she chugged it”. He joked that “sometimes you go so far right you come out on the other side”. Her annoyance over the situation and with some of Trump’s decisions has led to pushback from Ted Cruz. “It feels like Jurassic Park when the velociraptors turn on the guys running the place,” Kimmel said. He also added that Cruz “can go trick or treating without a mask”. Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also spoke about Trump’s trip to parts of Asia, which rightwing media has branded “a resounding success”. He played a clip of a Fox News pundit complimenting his handshake with Xi Jinping, saying it clearly showed who owned the room. “No one in American history has been worse at handshakes than Donald Trump,” Meyers said in response, noting that there is an entire Wikipedia article titled Donald Trump and handshakes. After Chuck Schumer called the trip “a total dud”, Trump claimed it was “almost treasonous” to use such words. Meyers joked that “the real treason is when your detractors get sassy”. Meyers also said that Trump “likes going abroad” because “here at home everyone’s mad at him”."
culture_2025_oct_31_the-guide-215-why-cant-we-get-enough-of-bohemian-rhapsody.txt,culture,2025-10-31,Gwilym Mumford,The Guide #215: Why we can’t get enough of Bohemian Rhapsody,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/31/the-guide-215-why-cant-we-get-enough-of-bohemian-rhapsody,"Fifty years ago this very day, Queen released Bohemian Rhapsody as a single. By the time it reached record stores it was already familiar to many, having received extensive radio play by the likes of Kenny Everett (“Excuse me while I scrape myself off the ceiling,” was Everett’s reaction after its first spin). So the song climbed the charts quickly. Within a month it had gone to No 1, where it then sat for nine weeks, from the end of November to the end of January. And Bohemian Rhapsody has stayed lodged in pop music’s collective consciousness ever since. It’s a song so instantly familiar that you only need to hear that first multitracked vocal smear of “Is this the real life?” to replay all five minutes and 55 seconds of it in your head. You’re probably doing it right now, in fact. But how did it get so firmly lodged in the pop canon? After all, and this is hardly an original observation, but Bohemian Rhapsody is a deeply weird mega hit, a song that explodes all the usual rules of success. Everywhere you look there are contradictions. It’s a multimillion seller that has no chorus, numerous tempo and key changes, ambiguous and difficult-to-parse lyrics and a long running time. Musically, with its Gilbert and Sullivan operetta leanings, it has more in common with the 19th century than the 20th, let alone the 21st, but it’s also the most streamed 20th-century song this century, a musical throwback that nevertheless dragged pop into the music-video age. It’s both celebrated as a queer anthem or an extended metaphor for coming out, and is the British armed forces’ favourite song. It’s an extremely silly, borderline novelty hit that is also sort of deeply serious: “If I’m not back again this time tomorrow/ Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.” And for a song often garlanded with the phrase “universally beloved”, Bohemian Rhapsody is disliked by plenty of people, from the critics who famously panned it at the time of release to the Spectator columnist who stuck the boot in just a couple of days ago (“… convinced multiple generations that operatic wailing, asinine lyrics and improbable time‑signature gymnastics remain the pinnacle of popular music”). On Reddit’s Unpopular Opinion board, there are so many variants of “Bohemian Rhapsody is bad” that the sentiment surely no longer qualifies as an unpopular opinion. Even the extremely genial football commentator Martin Tyler hates it, for some reason. I’m not quite in the Spectator-Redditor-Tyler faction myself, but I don’t exactly love Bohemian Rhapsody. A little of what Freddie Mercury described as its “pompous flair” definitely goes a long way for me, and bits of it are borderline unlistenable to my ears – “Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango” is nails down a blackboard. There’s also the not-insignificant factor of just having heard it too many times – at weddings and karaoke sessions (where it remains the most popular song to perform), on greatest No 1s countdown shows, and during late-night viewings of Wayne’s World. Still, in the overplayed song stakes it doesn’t feel as fatigued as, say, Mr Brightside; that’s despite Bohemian Rhapsody having a 28-year head start in overfamiliarity on the Killers’ indie disco staple. It’s probably not a coincidence that Bohemian Rhapsody doesn’t sound as exhaustingly overplayed as some of the worst offenders. For all its familiarity, half a century on there’s still an aura of complexity and mystery to the song. That’s evident not just in the musicianship, all those multitracked, million-part harmonies, but of course in its lyrics, which Mercury never unpacked, even reportedly to his bandmates. “People should just listen to it, think about it, and then make up their own minds as to what it says to them,” Mercury suggested, and into that vacuum interpretations have poured. Who is the man with the gun against his head, and who is the person pulling the trigger? Is it, as widely believed, Mercury coming to terms with his sexuality by killing his old, more straight-seeming self? (I’m intrigued by the theory that it’s actually a tribute to Herschel Grynszpan, the gay Jewish teen whose assassination of a German diplomat was used as a pretext for the events of Kristallnacht – though I’ve not seen that suggested anywhere else.) And what about that pomp rock middle section? Is there a meaning to the flurry of Galileos and Figaros and fandangos, or is it just gibberish to facilitate the “tongue-in-cheek and mock-opera” feel Mercury said he was striving for? Or both? It’s a song that has inspired endless fascination: just look at its Wikipedia page, with its hundreds of citations and footnotes. And, of course, it has inspired endless musicians too – though not in a conventional way. For all its uniqueness, Bohemian Rhapsody didn’t really usher in a new sound or genre: in fact, it represents the last knockings of one, prog rock, before it was washed away by the coming tide of punk. But instead Bohemian Rhapsody invented its own subcategory of song, a multipronged showstopper that could be replicated across genres and generations. Today, as it nears the 3bn mark on Spotify and the 2bn mark on YouTube, it’s hard to imagine Bohemian Rhapsody ever fading into obscurity. In its singular strangeness, it feels future-proof. It’s walled off from changing tastes and genres, destined to be sung on hen dos and karaoke nights for decades to come, the unknowable song that everyone knows.

culture_2025_oct_31_womad-festival-new-wiltshire-site-peter-gabriel.txt,culture,2025-10-31,Ben Beaumont-Thomas,Womad festival returns and moves to new Wiltshire site,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/31/womad-festival-new-wiltshire-site-peter-gabriel,"Womad festival, the global music festival co-founded by Peter Gabriel, is to return in 2026 at a new venue. The festival took a year off in 2025 in order to “return fully charged”, and left its home of Charlton Park, Wiltshire, where it had been held since 2007. Its new venue remains in Wiltshire, at nearby Neston Park in Corsham. “It immediately felt to us like a warm and welcoming home into which we could sink our roots,” Gabriel said. “In a world in which many bad actors seem to be achieving power by fanning the flames of hatred, racism and division, a meeting place for all the world’s cultures and dreams, built on mutual respect, seems all the more precious,” he added. Womad is an acronym for World of Music, Arts and Dance, and it has one of the broadest musical remits in the British festival scene. Artists tend to span pop, dance, folk, jazz, hip-hop and beyond, and are drawn from a diverse range of global nations. Neston Park is a stately home owned by Sir James and Lady Venetia Fuller: James is one of the family board members for Fuller’s brewery, and Venetia is an entrepreneur. “This will be the first time we’ve opened the estate to any type of event and Womad’s message and what it stands for is something we’ve long admired,” they said in a joint statement. The festival began in 1982 in Shepton Mallet, moving to near Reading between 1990 and 2006, followed by Charlton Park."
culture_ng-interactive_2025_nov_30_judi-love-comedian-loose-women-taskmaster-interview.txt,culture,2025-11-30,Michael Segalov,"Comedian Judi Love: ‘I’m a big girl, the boss, and you love it’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2025/nov/30/judi-love-comedian-loose-women-taskmaster-interview,"Judi Love was 17 when she was kidnapped, though she adds a couple of years on when reliving it on stage. It was only the anecdote’s second to-audience outing when I watched her recite it, peppered with punchlines, at a late-October work-in-progress gig. The bones of her new show – All About the Love, embarking on a 23-date tour next year – are very much still evolving, but this Wednesday night in Bedford is a sell out, such is the pull of Love’s telly star power. She starts by twerking her way into the spotlight, before riffing on her career as a social worker and trading “chicken and chips for champagne and ceviche”. Interspersed are opening bouts of sharp crowd work – Love at her free-wheeling best. Next, she’s at college, studying IT, but mostly “going into the games room looking for boys”. It’s here that Love meets this unnamed lad. “He was damn crazy,” Love tells me over Zoom a few days later. She’s stuck at home in south-west London, waiting for a delivery. “We didn’t do red flags then. He just had some issues, but I wanted to nurture, and didn’t recognise the warnings. At that age, you don’t know yourself, or what a good relationship is.” As she tells it, the first date didn’t sound promising: “He came to my mum’s house, stripped naked and cried.” Still, round two nonetheless followed (he was six foot four! And had a six pack!), this time at his place. He made them spag bol and then, from nowhere, forced her upstairs and into the shower, holding her hostage for the best part of 48 hours. “You try to convince yourself it isn’t happening.” She shakes her head in retrospective disbelief. “And then: oh, it actually is.” Momentarily, she contemplated the worst. “I decided not to go down that rabbit hole. That wasn’t going to be my legacy. Get out alive; I’ll survive anything else.” Today, again, she recounts it all, and her lucky escape, with a playful buoyancy. It’s this everything-is-an-anecdote attitude that defines Love’s appeal as both presenter and comedian; her dexterity when switching between serious sincerity and infectious laughs. “What I’ve learned now I’m a 45-year-old woman,” she says, “is that traumas I’ve gone through remain in my system. It’s laughter that’s helped me. Bringing the funny out of it all might allow someone else to also laugh, to lose that shame, to forgive themselves and to heal.” It is a mantra that Love intends to shape her new show around, as and when she finds time to write it. Life has been hectic these past few years. “Let me tell you, babe,” she says, “I’m surprised I’ve got a hairline left at this point. I should be slimmer, because of this up and down, up and down? I’m doing jobs like I’m on the stepper at the gym!” There’s the daytime chatshow Loose Women (she’s a regular), where she makes drawing laughs from unscripted, off-the-cuff storytelling seem impossibly easy, and at times unintentional. It’s all part of her charm. She’s on a steady stream of TV panel shows, and has had a script commissioned. Recent turns on Amazon hit Last One Laughing UK and Taskmaster saw Love in her element. At the intersection between anarchic standup and more structured TV work, Love is able to showcase her improv chops, but with rules to poke fun at, other comics to bounce off, and authority to rub up against. She’s also taking on acting work: an upcoming Channel 4 comedy, Schooled, and she just finished a stint on set filming Girl Group, a Rebel Wilson film slated for a 2026 release. It’s also been a relentless period personally – fertile ground, she concedes, for material. “Friends losing loved ones, my family, too. I’ve two children, aged 20 and 16, and let me tell you something.” She shakes her head, lifting the thick rim of her glasses. “Well, shit, I’ve been a single parent for like, 20 years, and it’s exhausting. I’m fucking tired. Money and success doesn’t take away the emotion of my kids not growing up with their dad.” There’s also her fitness kick, “not necessarily to lose weight, but get healthy”. She’s in therapy now, with “the mental space and finances to afford it. Oh, OK, that’s what that pattern is. And I’m 45, perimenopause … that bitch is trying to climb her way out. I’m like: not today! I can’t be sweating on stage more than I already am.” It’s almost surprising, I suggest, that Love has booked such a hefty solo tour – potentially exposing, definitely exhausting – with so many other lucrative opportunities dangling to which she’s so well suited. She suffers severe stage fright, and while her first tour in 2023 relied on “material slowly worked on over years after coming into comedy”, this time she’s starting from scratch. “It’s about authenticity,” she says. “I sometimes speak patois on TV, or like I’ve just come off the road in south London. I’ll speak about being a single mum and hard times, dealing with racism and sexism and misogynoir.” However, lunchtime broadcasts of Loose Women come with certain restrictions. “I say it how it is, but in a very TV, PC way. We haven’t got time for Ofcom to be coming every day. It’s a filtered version.” She does spend a significant chunk of her stage time in Bedford recounting sexual exploits and contemplating the allure of “becoming a massive hoe” in her mid-40s. More than that, a full standup set offers Love the space to go deeper. “You can be selfish and take up the time,” she says, “On TV, you’ve got two minutes, with someone in your ear on the next subject. Up there, I can explain, whether about childhood or the last relationship I had. As nervous as I am, and as sick as I feel before, the moment I step on that stage it feels like: this is me.” Love grew up in east London, the youngest of five. “I was the class clown at school,” she says, “but shy and nervous. I was dyslexic and didn’t know. I would look at words and think: I don’t understand. Anything creative, however, I did great.” She was raised by “women who came over in the Windrush era: nurses, social workers, cleaners or social carers. Those were the jobs they were allowed to have when they came … For me, that always seemed the natural thing.” Becoming a young carer herself also steered her in that direction. “I was exposed to social services from nine years old. My mum wasn’t well, and my next sister was only 19.” The rest of the siblings and extended family weren’t around, “so we had support from social care. Mum was in hospital for months.” She had an aneurism, five strokes, and was later diagnosed with dementia. “A social worker came round and looked at what we needed. I learned about these people out there who could help.” Love worked in social care for years: young offenders, kids in the care system, mental health services. “I could empathise,” she says, “having a complex family with complex lives myself. There’s a lack of funding, and a high proportion of Black and working-class women in there. Seeing women who look like me, but just had a different path. It was a constant reminder of how easy it is for things to happen.” In 2009, Love’s mum died; later that year her second child was born. “It was around then that I got bad depression,” she says. “I was lost. I’d grown up as ‘Judi with the sick mum’, but then she died. Who was I now?” On the brink of breaking down, “I said to my family: please look after the kids, I need to take a break.” An old colleague had relocated to Barbados. “I didn’t even know her that well, but I called her, at my most vulnerable, and told her I needed to get away but couldn’t afford … I didn’t even finish the sentence. Come, she said.” Love wraps her arms around herself. “I stepped off that plane, and was shown so much love and empathy.” Her voice breaks. “I came back thinking: right, I’m going to do something. People had always said to me: you’re empathetic, and you’re funny. I started comedy around 2011, then a few years later [2014], my social work master’s.” There’s a banging at the front door. “Sorry babes,” Love calls out, springing up, “that’s my delivery.” Off-camera, she jokes (and flirts) with two burly blokes. “It’s a velvet sofa to go in my outhouse,” Love says, leaning briefly into view. “It’s blue, but I wanted orange. The kids weren’t having it. Booboo, I said to them, we’ve got an outhouse. Easy on your damn selves.” Eventually, Love returns, having slipped them a tenner. Then the door goes, again. “Yes babe, we can take a selfie.” While Love has funny bones, she took the scenic route into entertainment. Open mics first, before making a name for herself on the “urban circuit”. It wasn’t her comfort zone, initially, but something shifted on stage. “It felt like I found my power: I’m a big girl, the boss, and you love it; I’m a beautiful Black woman and I’ll tell you how it is.” Meanwhile, she was working full-time at Waltham Forest council in north-east London. “We’d moved to south London – there’d been a lot of black mould in my previous council property.” It made for a two-hour commute, impossible to juggle with childcare and comedy. “I was getting tiny offers – bits of filming, small roles on pilots – all clashing with work.” In 2019, she quit her job, taking on cleaning work and zero-hours care roles to supplement her comedy income. “It was very scary, but I thought: girl, please, you’ve been broke before.” Life is unrecognisable now, hanging out with Dave Chappelle, Talib Kweli, Kevin Hart and Chris Rock. A Soho House dinner “with the director of The Greatest Showman on one side, and James … Corbyn? Corden! I was talking to him about his whole mess, because you know …” Home now is a fancy corner of the London suburbs. “My daughter will always say,” Love mimics a teenage voice, “‘Yeah, I remember the days, yeah.’ Girl, what do you remember? My son don’t remember shit. He thinks we always lived this good life.” She’s pleased about that: “Even then we were rich in love. We might have only had a couple of three-for-a-pound packets of noodles, but we filled our time with joy, because we had less.” The industry doesn’t always feel set up for Love to thrive. Live TV can be a minefield. “When the Autocue comes up,” she says, “I still panic, even if before that, my team has worked with me to break down words into phonics so I can pronounce them right.” Often, she’ll simply use this to her advantage: her Taskmaster mispronunciation of Rubik’s Cube (Ruby Cubey?) an expertly landed, pre-planned gag. “I’m also constantly called the wrong name,” she continues, “confused for another Black woman. It doesn’t matter how rich or successful I am: bitch, you’re Alison Hammond today.” Being a single parent doesn’t make for smooth scheduling. “If I’m filming or performing away,” she says, “even if it’s a 2am finish and four hours of travelling after, I’ve got to get me home so my kids wake up with me there. If I’m not, nobody else is. The hardest thing is managing guilt … When they’re 30, will they turn around and say: it was great, but you missed everything?” It has paid off, of course. In 2024, she became the first Black British female comic to sell out the London Palladium. She’s hoping to achieve that same feat at the capital’s Eventim Apollo next year. “When that was put out there,” Love retorts, “I said, are you sure? Sure sure? There’ve been so many others who could and should have done all this. Just like the slew of Black British actors who have felt a move to the US to be a career necessity (John Boyega, Daniel Kaluuya, Cynthia Erivo … the list goes on), the same has been true for Black women in comedy. “You’ve got Gina Yahsere and London Hughes – they went to America to make it. I’m happy to be doing this, as long as I’m not the last.” Love is acutely aware of the strains that come with this representation. The second half of her show is dedicated to the compounding pressures of playing mother, entertainer, public figure, groundbreaker, and the deep-rooted desire to “scream fuck it” and torch it all. “I wrote my master’s dissertation,” she says, “on how stereotypes of the ‘strong Black woman’ affect our emotional and mental health. That was my mum and my family. They’d been through so much: emotional abuse, physical abuse, working five jobs. This narrative, I realised, is killing us.” It’s a balance she’s still striking, “trying to not take on that same trophy. I see it happening: working hard, supporting others, not always looking after myself.” It is tempting to portray Love’s transition from struggling social worker to booked-and-busy celeb as some sort of girl-done-good elevation. Only, I point out, it sounds quite like she misses her past professional life. “Yeah babe,” she replies, smiling, “I’m going to do my PhD in psychotherapy. I don’t know if it’ll be weird, someone coming to my little office in the back and realising their therapist is Dr Judi Love.” There’s already a sofa ready and waiting out back. “It’s the great thing about being a 45-year-old woman in 2025. I can go and study my PhD, I can sell out the Palladium; I can have another baby, get married, or go out and be a massive hoe. I can do what my mum, aunties and grandmas couldn’t. I’ll never let that go.” Judi Love: All About the Love is touring 12 February to 24 May; tour starts Basingstoke; she performs at Eventim Apollo, London, 19 June."

But it appears you are more likely to be visited by a ghost if you are under 35 years old, while spiritual creatures tend to avoid those who live in the East Midlands. New research from the National Folklore Survey has found that, across England, more than a third of people believe in ghosts and supernatural beings, but belief in the paranormal varies according to age and geography. Led by academics from Sheffield Hallam University, the University of Hertfordshire, and Chapman University in the US, the survey is the first of its kind since the last Survey of English Language and Folklore more than 60 years ago. Just over one in three people in England said they believed in ghosts or the spirits of the deceased, with younger people (aged 25-34) most likely to believe in the paranormal, which also includes magical beings, possession, spells, psychics, angels and demons. “Folklore has exploded on social media,” Dr Sophie Parkes-Nield, one of the researchers, said. “On things like TikTok, there’s PaganTok and WitchTok. Young people are really embracing folklore and making it their own.” Dr David Clarke, another researcher, said that was in part why they “wanted to rerun this survey now”, adding the previous one “was long before internet and social media existed”. “The influence of TV and film – that’s something we wanted to try and capture,” he said. “We also wanted to make it more multicultural as well, and we’ve got, I think, 15% ethnic minority interaction with it.” Ipsos UK surveyed 1730 people over 16 from a panel based on representation of people who live in England, taking into account age, education, gender, ethnicity, religion, region and income. In total, 39% of survey respondents said they believed there was life after death; 36% said they believed ghosts or spirits of deceased people existed; and 27% said they believed it was possible to communicate with the dead. Meanwhile, 16% of respondents reported they had had a supernatural experience, but almost one in five had never discussed it with anyone, even family and friends. In addition, 45% said they had experienced deja vu, while more than a fifth said they had had a premonition of the future. Parkes-Nield said: “Something that surprised me was, of the people that say they believe in ghosts, they are more likely to be female, but they’re also more likely to believe that the presence of ghosts is something that’s comforting or quite nice, whereas the people who are more likely to believe ghosts are scary are more likely to be male.” The research also found that more people in England celebrate Bonfire Night than Halloween – 46% said they either always or sometimes celebrated Halloween, compared with 52% for Bonfire Night. Almost a third of people said they gave out treats for Halloween, while just under 30% planned to watch scary films or TV, and more than a quarter to carve a pumpkin. However, participation in Halloween activities dropped off significantly in those over the age of 45. The academics also found regional variations, with people in London far more likely to use a Ouija board, or hold a seance, and people living in the East Midlands less likely to take part in Halloween activities or to believe in the supernatural. “What came out is that if you live in the East Midlands, it’s being described as a folklore-free zone,” Clarke said. “They seem to come out lowest.” Part of the enduring appeal of folklore, and celebrations including Bonfire Night, the researchers said, was the sense of community it created. Dr Diane Rodgers, another researcher, said: “I think there was an explosion of re-engaging with Halloween, particularly in terms of taking kids out trick-or-treating, post Covid.” She added people were “really engaging with it”, not “just as a way of doing something as a community, but also going out and doing something and getting kids away from screens”. Parkes-Nield said: “It’s a universal sort of need, I think, to come together to celebrate points in the year, to mark the year, and particularly at this time of year where the nights are dark and damp. “People want something to do, to get out the house and to celebrate, to light up the dark evenings.”"
news_2025_dec_01_boobera-lagoon-dip-toes-into-learning-dormant-language.txt,news,2025-11-30,"Ella Archibald-Binge, photographs by Blake Sharp-Wiggins","At Boobera Lagoon, I dip my toes into learning a long-dormant language",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/01/boobera-lagoon-dip-toes-into-learning-dormant-language,"Warning: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains images and names of Indigenous Australians who have died We’re bumping along a rugged bush track when the scrub clears to reveal the spot our guide calls “the east coast Uluru”. “It’s a bit of a surprise,” says Carl McGrady, a Gomeroi elder. “It’s almost hard to believe this place exists in this environment.” Boobera Lagoon stretches before us: a vast body of water spanning 7km, fed by an artesian spring beneath the dry plains of north-western New South Wales. There is no sign for the turnoff. The track is deliberately rough. Traditional owners would prefer to keep this spot hidden. The sacred waterhole has been a meeting place for Aboriginal people for millennia. And now it has become a place of baptism for Gomeroi people returning to country – which, on this scorching spring morning, includes me. “For mob who come home for the first time, I say go to Boobera and jump in the water, then you know you’re home,” Uncle Carl says. Pelicans on Boobera Lagoon It has taken me 34 years to get here, even though I was raised just three hours away. I am a proud descendant of the Kamilaroi people (also spelled Gamilaroi/Gomeroi/Gamilaraay*), whose lands cover a sprawling patch of NSW, from Tamworth up to the Queensland border. I grew up hearing tales from my pop, Neville Binge, of yowies and bunyips – and, towards the end of his life, about the mission days. I had visited my country, usually for work trips. But I had never visited the place where Pop’s story, and so many of our Kamilaroi stories, began. For the past few months I’ve been speaking to First Nations communities who are reclaiming languages that were stolen from them during colonisation. Thanks to the work of elders, the first steps to learning language for my generation can be as simple as signing up to an online Tafe course. But I have never found the right time to start and it has riddled me with guilt. The few basic words I’ve learned – yaama (hello), yaluu (see you again), yinarr (woman), dhinawan (emu) – I’ve gleaned mostly from apps, workshops and books. While reading JM Field’s essay on Gamilaraay kinship, The Eagle and the Crow, I was struck by how much is lost in translation. He describes yarragaa – “the warm wind that kisses the trees to make them bloom”. The direct translation is “spring”. It bothers me that my understanding of these concepts is not grounded in place. As Uncle Carl says, if you’re learning Japanese, you need to go to Japan. If you’re learning Gamilaraay, you need to “come out and taste the dirt”. So I’ve travelled to my late grandfather’s country around the tiny Aboriginal town of Toomelah, just shy of the Queensland border in north-western NSW, to learn how language, country and culture intersect, and to find my place within them. Carl McGrady on the banks of the Macintyre River in Boggabilla Uncle Carl, 72, has graciously agreed to be my guide. The self-professed “king of the border” is inundated with requests to share his culture. He agreed to mine largely out of loyalty to Pop, who coached him as a young footballer in Tenterfield, three hours east of the Toomelah mission where they were both raised, a decade apart. Our first stop is a patch of bushland about 50 minutes’ drive west of Toomelah (Dhumalaa, meaning “people who move a lot”). Kamilaroi families were moved between several sites after the NSW government restricted Aboriginal people to missions and reserves. This one, known as Old Toomelah, is where my great-grandparents lived from about 1926 to 1938, surviving on rations and bush food – or the odd scrap of offal from a neighbouring farmer. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads As we crunch through the dry grass, Uncle Carl plucks a leaf from a saltbush tree and chews on it. In his youth, he says, people would eat goannas but never gumuuma (small lizards). He points out the names and uses of native shrubs: the eurah tree (“blackfella’s penicillin”); warrigal greens and the sacred bambul (orange) tree, said to embody the mother-in-law of Garriya, the rainbow serpent. “Back when things were being created, everything had spirits: rocks, trees, people,” he explains. Above: Uncle Carl and Ella explore Old Toomelah Below: Uncle Carl grew up eating bush foods All that remains of the mission are a few house stumps, a large clearing where “the old people would be dancing around the fires” and a collection of headstones, which Uncle Carl points out as we clamber through a barbed-wire fence. A headstone at the Old Toomelah cemetery “The cluster of small ones is part of the reason why they had to move,” he says. An unknown disease had swept through the mission, killing about a dozen babies in six months. It is a ritual to come here and touch the tombstones as a mark of respect. As we drive into “New Toomelah”, the last mission site for Gomeroi families upon which the present-day town was built, Uncle Carl gestures to the junction where the Dumaresq and Macintyre rivers meet. “Your Pop would’ve known every blade of grass along there,” he says. “That was our playground.” After school, he says, the kids would swap their uniforms for threadbare shorts “more like lap laps” (loin cloths), disappearing into the bush to hunt until sundown. They were too young to understand that their lives were dictated by the strict protocols of the NSW Aborigines Protection Act, which wasn’t repealed until 1969. Adults needed permission to work in town, and the two-bedroom houses – usually home to at least eight kids sleeping top to toe – were routinely inspected for cleanliness. Parents lived in constant fear of having their children taken. Speaking language was forbidden. Above: A cottage that would have housed up to 12 people in Toomelah Below left: an old photo of people at the mission there Below right: Toomelah legend Charlie Dennison “The fear of that far outweighed the hunger and need to want to pass on the culture,” Uncle Carl says. “Unfortunately here we are a hundred years later … trying to resurrect it.” He grew up speaking mission English – mostly English words arranged to mimic the fluid word placement of Gomeroi grammar. It was a sly way to retain some Gomeroi words and language conventions without drawing the ire of the mission manager. A standard greeting would be “Where you from come?” I never heard my Pop speak his language. It wasn’t until Uncle Carl started teaching at a local school in the 1990s that he and other teachers set about trying to revive his mother tongue – initially by furiously scribbling notes as the aunties reminisced over billy tea by the river. “Those days were the first sort of realisation that our language was not dead – it’d been asleep,” he says. Ella and Uncle Carl visit a classroom at Toomelah public school Those scribblings turned into books, which helped shape the school’s first Gamilaraay language course. There are now more than 90 Gamilaraay speakers, ranking it among the top 10 Indigenous languages being revived nationally, according to a 2019 survey by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. Schools in a dozen NSW towns study Gamilaraay/Gomeroi. These days Uncle Carl reckons he’s about 30% fluent but he knows enough to “chuck a few lingo words” into conversations with his grandkids or students. “My language is my country,” he says. “I couldn’t see those things ever being separate.” Sometimes the 72-year-old takes youngsters to Boobera Lagoon to share its creation story, as he does for me. Standing at the water’s edge, he tells me the waterhole was traditionally the resting place of the Garriya, shunned by the local Murris who dared not disturb his spirit. One day they decided they had to find a way to hunt the teeming wildlife along its banks, nominating their bravest warrior, Dhulala, to confront the serpent. “Loaded up with his super spears and boomerangs and shield, he came down to the point and cooeed out, ‘Garriya, ngami-la ngay! [Look at me!],’” says Uncle Carl, his voice booming across the water. “Garriya came to the surface and saw this cheeky fella and started coming towards him.” Garriya fended off Dhulala’s weapons and chased him across the plains, carving channels across the landscape as he went. Dhulala found shelter under a bambul tree – Garriya’s mother-in-law. It is a Gomeroi custom that you do not acknowledge your mother-in-law, so Garriya returned to the lagoon, where he still rests. Gomeroi people will not visit the waterhole after dark. “It’s just a no-go area,” Uncle Carl says. “To me, it’s part of my religion.” As our trip nears its end, I return to the lagoon. Uncle Carl’s words are fresh in my mind: “Putting your toes in the water at Boobera, touching the headstones at Old Toomelah – that’s a different level of being on country.” Ella stands at the shore of the waterhole I do not yet know my language. But I’ve tasted the saltbush and I’ve heard the chatter of birds descending on the lagoon as the sun dips, and that feels like a good place to start. I step into the milky water and feel the grainy mud between my toes. A gust of wind sends down a shower of leaves. It feels as though someone is saying hello. It isn’t until I get home that I find the right word to describe the sensation: yarragaa. *The spelling of words and how stories are told can change depending on what has been passed down through different families and cultural groups"

Emergency services continued to search through the seven towers of the Wang Fuk Court estate in Tai Po on Monday, days after the city’s deadliest fire in 75 years. The death toll rose to 151 and is expected to rise further as the search continues. About 40 people are still missing. The estate, home to almost 5,000 people, had been undergoing extensive renovations that have been linked to the fire’s cause. In the aftermath, anger has grown over alleged past safety violations by the construction company working at the site and lax enforcement of standards, fuelled by revelations that residents had been complaining about the renovations for a year. On Monday afternoon, officials said anti-corruption authorities had arrested 13 people over the disaster so far, including the directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company, and had “immediately begun comprehensive investigation along the lines of manslaughter”. Hong Kong’s chief secretary, Eric Chan, said seven of 20 tested samples of the mesh netting used in scaffolding around the towers did not meet fire-retardant standards. Initial testing found samples were up to code, but Chan said the cheaper, noncompliant netting had been put in areas difficult to access in order to evade detection, describing it as a “shameful act”. “They just wanted to make money at the expense of people’s lives,” he said. As allegations of safety violations grow, alongside revelations that government authorities had issued multiple apparently unenforced warnings, residents have asked why no officials have yet faced consequences. Instead, two civilians were reportedly arrested by national security police. Miles Kwan, a Hong Kong student, was arrested on Saturday over an online petition that made “four demands” for guaranteed support of the victims and accountability for those at fault, including any corrupt or culpable government officials. Local media said Kwan was arrested for “seditious intention”. Police did not confirm the arrest, saying only that they “will take actions according to actual circumstances and in accordance with the law”. Kwan was seen leaving a police station on Monday afternoon, Agence France-Presse reported. Local media also reported the arrest of Kenneth Cheung, a former district councillor, on Sunday evening. Asked on Monday about the arrests, the secretary of security, Chris Tang, said only there had been “inaccurate comments online” that were intended to threaten national security. “Therefore, we must take appropriate measures, including law enforcement measures,” Tang told the press conference. “Operational details cannot be disclosed as they involve national security.” On Hong Kong social media, people criticised the arrests of civilians. “National security must be prioritised even if the dead are still buried in the building,” said one. Some commenters drew comparisons to mainland China. “The mainland calls these crimes ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’,” said one commenter. “It’s usually punished with heavy sentences. Stability trumps everything.” Another said: “Now that we are aligning with mainland China’s approach, by dealing with the person who raises the question, no one will dare to ask questions, and thus Hong Kong’s governance will have no problems.” The arrests followed warnings by national security authorities that they would crack down on anyone deemed to be using the incident to incite “anti-China” sentiment. Before the arrests, authorities had already begun showing heightened sensitivity to the community response in Tai Po. Since the 2019 protests were quelled, civilian gatherings have been tightly controlled or prevented in Hong Kong. On Thursday and Friday the Guardian witnessed the rapid establishment of volunteer supporters using skills not seen at this scale since the protests, with hundreds of people using cars and public transport to bring in mountains of clothes, food and other essentials for the victims. The Guardian did not see any sign of political activism. However, by evening, armed police were patrolling the area, and government officials soon took over from volunteer organisers. The petition over which Kwan was allegedly arrested was launched late on Friday. Its “four demands” echoed the language of the protest movement’s “five demands” for democratic progress, but did not call for political change. Kwan told media on Friday that he was only “proposing very basic demands”. “If these ideas are deemed seditious or ’crossing the line’, then I feel I can’t predict the consequences of anything any more, and I can only do what I truly believe,” he said.

news_2025_dec_01_the-australian-school-spearheading-an-indigenous-language-revival.txt,news,2025-12-01,"Ella Archibald-Binge, photographs by Carly Earl",The Australian school spearheading an Indigenous language revival,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/01/the-australian-school-spearheading-an-indigenous-language-revival,"There are several words for “morning” in the Gumbaynggirr language but bambuuda is Anne-Marie Briggs’ favourite. Drawn from bamburr, meaning soft and gentle, it speaks to the quiet moments before sunrise, literally translating as “in the softness”. “Doesn’t it just melt your heart?” says Anne-Marie, sitting at the kitchen table of the Coffs Harbour home she shares with her 12-year-old son, Darruy. The pair have found an easy morning routine since moving to Coffs three years ago. On a bright spring day Darruy wolfs down his Weet-Bix before strolling across the road to the small independent school that has been making headlines for its unique approach to education on the New South Wales mid-north coast. Gumbaynggirr Giingana Freedom school students sing and dance to start the day When the bell rings, the students converge on a shady sandpit. They stomp bare feet to the click of clapsticks, singing and dancing as the sun gathers warmth. By 9.30am, barely a word of English has been spoken. This is how each day begins at the Gumbaynggirr Giingana Freedom school, the state’s first Aboriginal bilingual school. GGFS opened three years ago amid a broader push to breathe new life into the critically endangered Gumbaynggirr language. Sign up: AU Breaking News email As Indigenous languages decline, Gumbaynggirr is experiencing a resurgence. What began with a handful of elders pooling their pensions to record a few words in the 1980s has led to its revival, to the point where it is once again being spoken in homes and learned by babies. Attendance levels are 88.5% – above the average rate for all students across Australia Pupils pore over an Indigenous languages map at the school On a busy Monday morning, Clark Webb, a Gumbaynggirr and Bundjalung man, is treading the school verandas barefoot, his wavy dark hair pushed back by a thick headband. His relaxed demeanour belies the fierce ambition that saw him spearhead the school’s formation as the chief executive of the Bularri Muurlay Nyanggan Aboriginal Corporation. The corporation wanted to start a bilingual school partly because its members were seeing the education system “fail miserably”, Webb says. Aboriginal families were being blamed for gaps in attendance and academic achievement, he says, rather than schools looking inward at their own deficiencies. “It insinuates that our children are a problem and we know that’s not the case,” he says. Dozens of NSW schools teach Aboriginal languages but this is the state’s only bilingual school. GGFS is open only to Indigenous students from kindergarten to year 8. They attend at least one language class every day and have weekly lessons on country. Some advanced classes are taught almost exclusively in Gumbaynggirr. Bularri Muurlay Nyanggan Aboriginal Corporation chief executive Clark Webb When Darruy Briggs’ parents heard about the school, they decided to move a nine-hour drive north from their home in Queanbeyan. At the time, Darruy was unenthusiastic about education. His father Robert Briggs, a Thunghutti and Gumbaynggirr man, and mother Anne-Marie, a German Australian, hoped a school built on Aboriginal culture might be a better fit. “He’s not like a Naplan sort of a kid but he is very smart,” Anne-Marie says. Darruy says the difference between his previous school and GGFS is ‘like night and day’ “I know how important language is for connecting with culture and knowing who you are as a person. I really wanted that for Darruy.” Three years on she says the change in her son has been “unbelievable”. He is already a confident language speaker – even legally adopting the Gumbaynggirr word for “good” as his first name (he was previously called Albert). Robert says his son is now dressed and eager to go to school every day. “When you stand at the gate of that school and you see the kids … they run through the gate,” he says “It’s the right place for our kids, because it understands them.” Darruy switches between Gumbaynggirr and English as he explains the difference between his current and former schools. “The difference is like night and day,” he says. “The other school … they didn’t really understand the components of Aboriginal culture. I do prefer this school a lot more, because they understand how culture is to us.” Courtney Elliott at the Kulai Aboriginal preschool A short drive from the school, on a balmy Tuesday evening, Courtney Elliott arrives at the Kulai Aboriginal preschool, fresh from her paediatric nursing shift, for her weekly Gumbaynggirr lesson. Parents and carers at GGFS are required to learn the language but it’s no chore for Elliott. “It’s kind of a break, to be honest with you,” she says. “It’s a giant family there.” Like Darruy’s parents, Courtney has noticed a transformation in her eight-year-old, Marlarrah, since she enrolled. At her former preschool another child once told her she was “too dirty to play with”. Above: Courtney with Desmond Ahoy and their children Bea, Raven and Marlarrah Below: Bea and Marlarrah show off their language skills “We were at a Naidoc event and she was saying things like, ‘I don’t want to get ochre on me because then people know I’m Aboriginal,’” Courtney says. “She wouldn’t dance any more. She was becoming completely disconnected from her culture … we just wanted her to go to a school where she was going to feel safe.” Now Marlarrah’s confidence has “skyrocketed”. Her younger sister Bea also attends GGFS. The use of Gumbaynggirr has become so normalised in the home that Courtney will accidentally slip into it at work. Even their one-year-old, Raven, knows a few words. GGFS opened with 15 students in 2022. Next year there are 95 students enrolled and more on a waitlist. Its goal is to become fully immersive, following the Māori schools model in New Zealand. But the venture has not been without challenges. The first was finding qualified teachers who can speak Gumbaynggirr, which the school solved by finding experts in one field then training them in the other. Webb says detractors tell him there’s no economic benefit to learning a “dead” language – the kids are better off studying Mandarin or French. They also ask if the children have a sufficient grasp of English. But results speak for themselves. Attendance levels are 88.5%, just above the average rate for all students nationally and far exceeding the national Indigenous attendance rate of 76.9%. And Naplan results are “just above average” for Indigenous students – but Webb says he has a different metric for measuring success. “Happiness,” he says. “When we bring our children up to feel really good about who they are through their language and through their culture, then all other learning is sorted.” The principal, Glen Cook, has been teaching for 30 years. He concedes that the school is still finding the right balance between Gumbaynggirr and western teaching methods. But the Dunghutti and Bundjalung man, who was forbidden from speaking his language as a child in the 1960s, says the importance of instilling pride in the students should not be underestimated. He recalls his year 3 teacher giving a lesson on “Aborigines”, whom she described as “savages” and “natives”. “You were never made to feel proud of who you are,” he says. A freedom rider looks back Gary Williams at the Muurrbay Aboriginal Language and Culture Co-operative in Nambucca Heads At Nambucca Heads, elders at the Muurrbay Aboriginal Language and Culture Co-operative are still pinching themselves that such a school exists. Its chief executive, the civil rights activist and freedom rider Gary Williams, remembers when a handful of the last remaining fluent Gumbaynggirr speakers gathered at an old church in Kempsey in 1986 for a meeting that would kick off a movement. Enlisting the help of a linguist, they made recordings and scoured archives to create the first Gumbaynggirr dictionary. The group morphed into Muurrbay, which develops language courses for schools, Tafes and the broader community, creating a blueprint that other NSW communities have begun to follow. Gumbaynggirr is now ranked among the top 10 Indigenous languages being renewed nationally, according to a 2019 survey by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. Uncle Micklo Jarrett says the quest to save Gumbaynggirr is unending One of Muurrbay’s first graduates, Michael “Micklo” Jarrett, is training the next crop of Gumbaynggirr teachers as an Aboriginal language and culture officer at the NSW education department. “When we first started, one of the biggest problems was not enough educators to go into all the schools,” he says. “Now our problem is we haven’t got enough schools for all the educators.” The hall that hosts Girrwaa Duguula choir rehearsals Jarrett says the quest to save Gumbaynggirr is unending. There are always new words to add to the dictionary: mobile phone (muya-banggi – breath fly); computer (marlawgay-bangarr – lightning brain) and floor (jali-julu – down side), to name a few. Eager to share the joy of language more widely, he started the Girrwaa Duguula (People Together) choir last year with a local musician, Ruth Kennedy. On Wednesday nights people from all walks of life, and aged from 12 to 75, meet at a country hall in the hinterland to learn songs in Gumbaynggirr.

news_2025_dec_02_hong-kong-fire-response-contrast-mainland-china.txt,news,2025-12-02,Amy Hawkins Senior China correspondent,Hong Kong responds to disaster differently from Beijing – but the gulf is narrowing,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/02/hong-kong-fire-response-contrast-mainland-china,"As Hong Kong mourns the victims of its worst fire in decades, the response to the disaster reveals the ways in which the semi-autonomous city retains differences from mainland China – and how some of those differences are being eroded. Hong Kong’s leader, John Lee, announced on Tuesday the creation of an “independent committee” to investigate the blaze, which killed 151 people at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex in Hong Kong’s New Territories. Hong Kong has a tradition of independent, judge-led inquiries into disasters, something that would never happen in mainland China, where the judiciary is controlled by the Chinese Communist party (CCP) and public discussion of tragedies is tightly controlled. But since the crackdown after the 2019 and 2020 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, including the implementation of two national security laws, many legal experts believe Hong Kong’s judiciary is no longer independent. Jonathan Sumption, a former UK supreme court justice, wrote last year as he resigned from Hong Kong’s court of final appeal: “The rule of law is profoundly compromised in any area about which the government feels strongly.” It is safe to assume that Hong Kong’s worst fire in decades, which appears to have followed months of complaints from residents about the potential flammability of materials used in construction works, is something that the government will feel strongly about. Authorities have already arrested 13 people, including several from a construction company, on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the blaze. No official has yet taken responsibility for the tragedy. The death toll from the fire will loom over the legislative council (LegCo) elections on Sunday, Hong Kong’s equivalent of a general election. But where in previous years there was feisty campaigning from different political parties and a rowdy public debate between candidates, this year, for the second time since the pro-democracy protests, it will be a “patriots only” affair, with only government-approved candidates being allowed to stand. “Having eliminated all opposition parties, the government no longer fears that a large number of candidates could win seats in the legislative council who want to challenge the status quo and might raise embarrassing questions during debates over bills backed by the chief executive,” said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, the chancellor’s professor of history at UC Irvine and author of Vigil: Hong Kong on the Brink. “What it does worry about now is something else that can be embarrassing: a small turnout.” In 2021, the first time that LegCo elections were held under the “patriots only” policy, turnout hit a record low of 30.2%. In 2016, turnout was 58.3%. Refusing to vote is one of the only ways that Hongkongers can safely voice their dissent against the government as other forms of protest have been criminalised. Over the weekend, Miles Kwan, a student, was arrested over a petition that demanded accountability from the government over the fire. Local media reported that two other people had been arrested. “Before the national security law, there wouldn’t be any repercussions for people just for speaking out,” Wasserstrom said. In mainland China, however, there are not any kinds of major elections – patriots-only or otherwise – that citizens can boycott. It is also impossible to imagine China’s leader, Xi Jinping, participating in an unscripted press conference like the one Lee held on Tuesday. An AFP journalist asked: “You have spoken about leading Hong Kong from chaos to order and from order to prosperity. And yet this prosperous society allowed 151 people to burn to death. Can you tell us why you deserve to keep your job?” Such a question would never reach the ears of Xi in a public forum. Similarly, although Hong Kong’s national security laws have done a lot to muzzle independent media, there is still a vastly more open information landscape than in mainland China, in part because Hong Kong does not block western social media platforms and Google. Last week, an article published in the Chinese media about the “hidden dangers” of cities in mainland China following in the footsteps of Hong Kong’s high-density housing model was scrubbed from the internet. The most direct comparison to a recent tragedy in mainland China is the Urumqi apartment fire in 2022, which killed at least nine people and sparked massive protests across China against the harsh zero-Covid measures in place at the time, which were believed to have prevented people from leaving the building. Those protests, which became known as the White Paper movement, spiralled into one of the biggest challenges to CCP rule since the 1989 Tiananmen protests, more than 30 years earlier. The Chinese government has tried to erase the 2022 and 1989 protests from public memory. The authorities will try to do the same in Hong Kong but are unlikely to be as successful.

news_2025_dec_02_the-labour-of-love-breathing-life-back-into-palawa-kani-the-lost-language-of-lutruwita.txt,news,2025-12-02,"Calla Wahlquist, photographs by Blake Sharp-Wiggins",The labour of love breathing life back into palawa kani – the lost language of Lutruwita,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/02/the-labour-of-love-breathing-life-back-into-palawa-kani-the-lost-language-of-lutruwita,"• Warning: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains images and names of Indigenous Australians who have died The photograph on the wall of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre in Launceston was taken 167 years ago. It shows a group of people including the most famous Palawa woman, Trukanini, at a barracks at Putalina/Oyster Cove. They are survivors of Wybalenna, the barren Flinders Island internment camp where 300 Aboriginal Tasmanians captured by government-sponsored roving parties were exiled in the 1830s. All but 47 died. Under their resolute gaze, Daisy Allan is speaking in a language that was painstakingly retrieved after the genocide of her people, her hands moving to emphasise the words’ meaning. The spring winds are fierce and have set off Allan’s allergies. “Munathiya nimina,” she says to two women who come to the door. “Grass sickness, hay fever.” Allan frequently speaks in the Tasmanian Aboriginal language, palawa kani, to other TAC staff. It’s part of her job as a language worker and, after 20 years of studying it, she is confident and fluent. The biggest hurdle when she began learning the language was finding other speakers. Now they’re plentiful. There are language modules for every stage of life, starting with songs to sing a baby in utero. Schoolchildren attend weekly lessons. Resources are available to all Palawa people. Unlike Allan’s generation and those of her parents, grandparents and great-grandparents, Palawa children today are born knowing the sounds of their language. They are the first to do so for 150 years. “It just goes to show the resilience and the resistance of Tasmanian Aboriginal people,” Allan says. “That we can stand strong against all odds, take pride in ourselves, refuse that push that we don’t exist, that we don’t have a language.” Words passed down As a child, June Sculthorpe would visit the Tasmanian Museum to hear her great-great-grandmother speak. Fanny Smith, who was born at Wybalenna in 1834, was recorded speaking and singing in the language of the north-eastern people towards the end of her life in 1899, and again in 1903. The wax cylinders have been damaged and the sound crackles but her voice carries through. “You’d press the button and there she would be,” Sculthorpe says. Ninety years after those recordings, Sculthorpe was appointed to lead a program to retrieve lost Tasmanian languages. It was a daunting task: the Aboriginal population was reduced from between 5,000 and 10,000 at the point of first settlement in 1803 to fewer than 100 by the late 1830s. When Trukanini died in 1876 it was widely and falsely reported that she was the last remaining Aboriginal Tasmanian. “It’s written somewhere that with the death of Trukanini the government gave a sigh of relief,” Sculthorpe says. “It was sort of like, ‘Oh phew, we want to forget everything.’ All the wars and the deceit – it was never ever taught in schools.” Sculthorpe didn’t know any words in her language. Aside from vocabularies pulled from colonial diaries and single words that had entered the broader lexicon, she didn’t know that any remained. But some family lines remembered. In the 1970s the linguist Prof Terry Crowley made recordings and captured a full sentence passed down among some of Fanny’s descendants: Tapilti ningina mumara prupari patrula/Go get a bit of wood and put it on the fire. Crowley went on to assist the TAC in training language workers, shared his research and its conclusion: that though there had once been at least eight distinct language groups, there wasn’t enough left of any one of them to bring it back. “So the community had decided to amalgamate, to get accurate and authentic words,” Sculthorpe says, adding: “We say it’s just like when our people were forced off mainland Tasmania and incarcerated at Wybalenna, with all different tribal groups together, and they all started sharing language and talking … it’s the way language can develop over time.” The result, palawa kani, is a reconstructed language – a term Sculthorpe says is often misconstrued to mean it has been made up. Rather, she says, it’s the work of more than 30 years of dedicated historical and linguistic research by more than 30 people. First, they analysed recordings of Fanny and others to isolate the sounds, then they developed a sound and spelling system complete with a reduced alphabet to remove duplicate sounds (using “k” not “g”, and “t” not “d”). Then they went back over the colonial recorders of Tasmanian languages to figure out what sounds they may not have been able to hear, and finally developed a method of documenting word histories to justify which words have been revived. “We weren’t really thinking that we would ever revive a language,” she says. “I think we amaze ourselves sometimes. There we were – not only were we as a people on the brink of extinction – but here we are now, a thriving people with our own language.” ‘My life’s work’ Theresa Sainty joined the language program in 1997. She has left the TAC now – as has Sculthorpe – but they still split the word retrieval work. Having worked their way through lists of plants, stars and directions, they are now considering a mountain of words for different times of day. Sainty’s family is descended from the Luna Rrala, women who were stolen as children and forced to partner Bass Strait sealers. Among them was her ancestor Pularilpana. Her home, in the southern seaside town of Primrose Sands, is filled with heavily annotated, spiral-bound copies of 19th-century diaries and vocabularies. On the kitchen bench in front of us is the word history for Titima/Trefoil Island, which Sainty began working on in 2002. Placenames are among the TAC’s most important work. Sixteen palawa kani names have been gazetted under the Tasmanian government’s dual naming policy. But the TAC has not submitted any new names since the Liberal government changed its policy in 2019 to allow words other than palawa kani submitted from other groups. Instead it has produced an online placename map for Lutruwita/Tasmania, which outlines the word history for each location. Titima’s word history is just one page but some can run to half a dozen and are “just fantastic reads”, Sainty says. “Even I’m blown away sometimes when I think ‘Fuck, that’s good work.’ We don’t come up with those words, we don’t come up with those placenames … it’s backed with solid research.” Her favourite word, wanapakalali, means work. It’s an adaptation of pakala, meaning bullock – a sign of how rapidly language evolved after first contact. Sainty is a “prolific writer” in palawa kani and English and is working on a PhD about language sovereignty and her experience working in the language program. “Writing songs, writing poetry, speaking at events, it’s activism,” she says. “And language is such a powerful and empowering tool to use in your activism.” Palawa kani is “one huge research project that’s informed by a number of smaller research projects”, says Sainty – and every person who has contributed to it has played an equal role. “This is my life’s work,” she says. Now to learn and speak Copies of that work and historical journals line the walls of the TAC office belonging to the palawa kani language program coordinator, Annie Reynolds. She joined the program in 1993 when Sculthorpe left to take up a position at the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, and as a non-Indigenous woman turned her efforts towards not the cultural business of word retrieval but on acquiring the primary sources needed to do the work. “Now you can sit in your lounge room and it’s all digitised, you can sit there in your pyjamas and access them,” she says. “But we had to buy them … we needed the copies of the originals to see the spelling … We contacted all these places by fax.” The vocabulary work is almost complete. Just a handful of words remain – excluding placenames, which require research ensuring that the word from the area’s language group has been correctly identified. The focus has turned to work done by Allan and others to encourage the Palawa community to learn and speak the language – and to encourage non-Indigenous people to use palawa kani placenames. Allan’s favourite is Lumaranatana, for the country around Cape Portland on the north-east coast. It was recorded by George Augustus Robinson in October 1830 as told to him by two women, Rramanaluna and Tanalipunya. “That’s the country of the women who survived who make up today’s Aboriginal community,” she says."

The comparisons with Hong Kong were not just visually obvious but also because the semi-autonomous city’s worst fire in decades appears to have followed months of complaints from residents about shoddy materials used in building works. Hong Kong is of course a very different place to London, with politicians facing less public accountability in a political climate that makes it much harder for citizens to express dissent. But, as anger rises, hard questions are nevertheless being asked of authorities amid accusations of negligence and corruption. For our cover story this week, Helen Davidson and Shanshan Kao report on the devastating aftermath of the fire, which has killed at least 151 people at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex, as public demand for accountability grows.

This week, I had the huge pleasure of an audience with Peepal Tree Press, which has been home to authors such as Bernardine Evaristo and Roger Robinson. Peepal Tree publishes books from the Caribbean and its diaspora, and has just celebrated its 40th anniversary. I spoke to its founder, Jeremy Poynting, and fiction editor Jacob Ross, and what ensued was a masterclass not only in publishing, but in diasporic art. A passion that became a publisher Peepal Tree is a rare story of an independent publisher that has not only survived and thrived, but stayed close to its roots. Literally. It is still based in the same house in Leeds where it was launched in 1985. Peepal Tree began, Poynting says, as “an expensive hobby”. Poynting had just completed a PhD on Caribbean writing, and in the course of his travels and research, met people who had books that they couldn’t get published. “I thought there was a niche there,” he says. There was no publishing industry in the Caribbean to speak of, and in the UK, large publishing houses were not interested in Black diaspora books that were not selling at commercial volumes. In the Caribbean itself, distribution was such a problem that it deterred publishing. “The region had such poor interconnections. You had to deal individually with every bookseller,” and writing about the Caribbean was “not much valued in the region”. In bookshops, there would be a “tiny section” for the genre. *** Pain and printing But Peepal Tree persevered. How did it go from a hobby to a going concern? “With pain,” Poynting says, laughing. To cut costs, he bought a printing press and set it up in the garage where they printed the first 12 books. “For 12 years we did everything,” he says; typeset, printed, folded, bound, and made books on the premises. Then Peepal Tree received an Arts Council grant, which, in addition to Poynting remortgaging the house, set the publisher on the path to viability. “It was very painful in the beginning, but what it enabled us to do was to punch over our weight. It got us off the ground. We realised that our backlist was generating significant amounts of money every year.” In the Caribbean, growth of demand and availability of their published works was “uneven” and “accidental”, he says. For example, he recollects, there were at one point “two really good shops in Guyana, and then the owner of one got a US green card, and that was it”. Half the book supply in the country disappeared overnight. Trinidad remains the strongest market due to having a substantial middle class, good bookshops, and a large literary festival in Bocas Lit Fest. *** A star-studded lineup of authors Peepal Tree’s first writers in the 1980s were “recently arrived”, Poynting says. Not Windrush generation, but those who had come to the UK after the first wave of Caribbean movement to Britain, and were writing about the region, but from a British base. Peepal Tree published Booker prize winner Bernardine Evaristo’s first work in the early 90s. And has gone on to publish such writers as Emily Zobel Marshall, Dorothea Smartt and Roger Robinson, who won the TS Eliot prize. Ross tells me that The Mermaid of Black Conch, written by Monique Roffey, and which won the Costa prize, had 12 or 13 rejections before Peepal Tree published it. This is where Peepal Tree distinguishes itself, he says, by being close enough to the subject matter to see its appeal in a way that more mainstream publishers cannot. The book was “set in the Caribbean, on issues that are quite particular to the colonial and postcolonial experience, it was a fable”, the sort that Peepal Tree grasped. *** Incubation of talent Peepal Tree uniquely still develops writers, rather than looking for the finished product. Kevin Jared Hosein, “who is massive now”, Ross says, was one of those writers that Peepal Tree worked with for “sometimes over a year. You want to see how they evolve and you are prepared to facilitate that evolution.” Robinson was another writer incubated within Peepal who “went on to become one of the most well-known poets on the contemporary Black British scene”. Remarkably, Peepal Tree runs a straight submissions process, sifting through a huge number of manuscripts and finding diamonds in the rough. They now publish writers from all Black British backgrounds. I was curious about what Peepal Tree made of the expansion of appetite among mainstream publishers for Black writers since Black Lives Matter. The answer was a fascinating and nuanced view on how Black writing can become compromised by the wrong gatekeepers: “We had an opening of the doors,” Ross says, “but this door has a spring, and it closes back almost automatically. What you’re now noticing, five years later, is a closing of that gap.” What was picked up, he says, was a “particular kind of Black writing that focused on trauma, that conforms to conventional classic English ideas of what writing is and what a novel is”, one that “doesn’t embrace the cultural elements or the tradition” the writers are from. *** Interrogation and the possibilities of Black writing “I don’t want to be too condemnatory,” Ross says. It should be fine to be so, I say to Ross, since one of the drawbacks of having a small space in the publishing scene is that sense of embattlement and therefore reluctance to constructively critique. “There’s a deeper issue here,” he responds. “The idea of a novel is not interrogated enough. Novel means new. And what we have lost, or what we risk losing, is the kind of malleability and flexibility that the novel as a piece of fictional architecture offers us. You don’t challenge the form itself. And I think there are enormous possibilities. I think that the writers coming from our cultural spaces and demographic need to think a little bit more about not just what they’re saying, but how they’re saying it. What cultural or narrative resources they can draw on from their own cultural space.” That is a thought, delivered with passion, that I think applies to all forms of writing, not just fiction. It rang loudly in my head as I left our conversation, and I felt briefly mentored, with a window into that transformative Peepal Tree treatment. • To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday, please subscribe here."

During the day they are bright white and at dawn and dusk they can take on the hues of sunrise and sunset. But how are they made? New research reveals that some cirrus clouds are seeded by storms on the other side of the world, many thousands of miles away. This has implications for global heating as storm patterns shift. Meteorologists have long recognised two types of cirrus cloud: “anvil” cirrus, which spread out from large storm systems, and “in-situ” cirrus, which seem to form on their own. Telling them apart is tricky, but by applying a new computer analysis to cloud satellite data, researchers spotted that in-situ cirrus emerged in response to major storm systems on the other side of the Earth. Reporting in the American Geophysical Union Advances journal, they propose the storms generate massive atmospheric waves that travel across the equator, altering the temperature profile in the upper atmosphere and causing in-situ cirrus to emerge. Cirrus clouds are thought to allow sunlight through and trap heat in the atmosphere, resulting in a net warming effect, so now we need to understand if future changes in storm patterns will change the distribution and amount of cirrus clouds."

It’s barely bigger than a paving slab, but since the pond has been in place we have had a garden teeming with frogs, hedgehogs have taken up residence and bird life has abounded. Not only do humble ponds like this give nature a boost; they also help to buffer climate extremes. In recent decades, Britain’s ponds have been disappearing, with research revealing that more than half of our dense network of ponds has been lost since the 1900s. Lucy Clarke and colleagues found that 58% of ponds in the Severn Vale region of the UK had been lost since the 1900s, with the average distance between ponds increasing by 25 metres over that time. Similar trends can be seen worldwide, with intensive agriculture and urbanisation obliterating these seemingly insignificant bodies of water. But now a pond revival is under way, with even tiny ponds such as mine helping to create biodiversity hotspots, plus provide cooling during heatwaves and help to slow the flow of water during heavy rains, reducing pressure on our overloaded drains and recharging parched groundwater reservoirs. Previously overlooked, ponds large and small are starting to be recognised as a vital habitat and a small but mighty climate mitigation tool."
news_2025_dec_04_hong-kong-fire-death-toll-protective-netting-remove.txt,news,2025-12-04,Helen Davidson and agencies,"Hong Kong warns ‘external forces’ working to exploit apartment fire, as death toll rises to 159",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/04/hong-kong-fire-death-toll-protective-netting-remove,"Hong Kong and Beijing officials have warned against what they claim are “external forces” threatening to exploit last week’s deadly apartment complex fire for political disruption, as rescuers say at least 159 people have been confirmed dead. The fire at the Wang Fuk Court in northern Hong Kong is the city’s worst disaster in 75 years, and the world’s most fatal residential building fire since 1980. The eight-tower complex – home to nearly 5,000 people – was under extensive renovations that have since been found to contain substandard, flammable materials. The secretary for development, Bernadette Linn, on Wednesday ordered all Hong Kong buildings undergoing major maintenance to remove their scaffolding netting by Saturday. The South China Morning Post reported the order would affect about 200 buildings. Authorities have arrested 15 people on suspicion of manslaughter, and another six on a different charge, over the estate’s fire alarms, which malfunctioned at the time of the blaze, police said. But much of the government’s focus has been on perceived political disruptors. Since the 2019 pro-democracy protests and subsequent government crackdown on all civil and political dissent, authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have made national security an overriding priority in the city, effectively crushing or silencing all opposition. At least three people have been detained under national security laws since the fire, including a university student, Miles Kwan, who promoted an online petition making “four demands” for victim support and accountability for those responsible. Hong Kong’s government on Wednesday warned against “foreign forces, including anti-China media organisations”, sowing discord, making “malicious attacks” and “slanderous remarks”. The city’s leader, John Lee, also warned against crimes that “exploit the tragedy”. Beijing’s national security arm in Hong Kong on Wednesday accused a “small group of hostile external forces” of taking advantage of the disaster to “stir up trouble and incite chaos”, creating petitions and replicating tactics of the 2019 protests. In a lengthy statement, the Office for Safeguarding National Security accused the unnamed forces of hiding in shadows, fanning flames, and “throwing mud” at the Hong Kong government and rescuers. “Their intentions are sinister, their actions are despicable, and they have provoked the wrath of both man and god,” it said, using a Chinese idiom. None of the statements provided details or examples of the behaviour they warned against, or identified the “external forces”, except for the reference by the office to petitions. A student union-run noticeboard at Hong Kong Baptist University – nicknamed a “democracy wall” – was blocked off on Wednesday, an Agence France-Presse reporter saw. The message stuck to the board, which remained visible behind tall barricades, read: “We are Hongkongers. Urge the government to respond to public demands so justice can be done.” Meanwhile, the search and rescue officials said the number of dead might still be revised as “suspected human bones” had been found that required forensic testing. Police said 19 of the 159 dead were yet to be identified. Investigators are focused on the materials used in the renovation works, some of which are believed to have made the fire worse. As the blaze spread, flames quickly covered the surfaces of the apartment blocks, which were wrapped with bamboo scaffolding, protective netting and foam boards. Lee had announced a judge-led independent review committee, rather than the more legally powerful inquiry commission that many had expected would be set up. Outgoing pro-establishment lawmaker Doreen Kong has said an inquiry commission would be better. “The government should give a valid justification for choosing to use a non-statutory committee to investigate,” she told Hong Kong Free Press. Mourners have continued to stream to a small park near the charred buildings, placing hundreds of bouquets and notes of remembrance for the victims – the youngest of whom was a one-year-old, and the oldest 97. “I hope people can come here to lay their grief to rest,” said Sarah Lam, a volunteer organiser of the memorial events, adding that the victims suffered “many injustices”. Residents of the sole unaffected tower were allowed to return home briefly on Wednesday to retrieve belongings. More than 2,900 residents had been provided with temporary housing, officials said."
news_2025_dec_04_record-numbers-becoming-billionaires-through-inheritance-ubs-report-finds.txt,news,2025-12-04,Lauren Almeida,"Record numbers becoming billionaires through inheritance, UBS report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/04/record-numbers-becoming-billionaires-through-inheritance-ubs-report-finds,"The super-rich are inheriting record levels of wealth as they pass down billions of dollars to their children, grandchildren and spouses, research by a Swiss bank favoured by billionaires shows. Globally, there are 2,919 billionaires this year, up from 2,682 in 2024, UBS found. Of these, 91 people this year became billionaires through inheritance, collectively receiving $298bn (£223bn) in the 12 months to April, the bank said. That was up more than a third against last year and the highest since UBS started its research in 2015. Among them are the six grandchildren of the late Asian paint tycoon Goh Cheng Liang, who died in Singapore in August aged 98. Each grandchild inherited stakes in a public company worth more than $1bn, according to reports. Meanwhile, 196 “self-made” entrepreneurs became billionaires this year, with a collective wealth of $386.5bn, UBS said. Benjamin Cavalli, an executive at the bank, said the increase in billionaire inheritance was proof of a “multi-year wealth transfer that’s intensifying”, with this group expected to inherit at least $5.9tn in the next 15 years. Most of the inheritance is expected to come from the US, followed by India, France, Germany and Switzerland. The UK ranked seventh, with $164bn in wealth expected to be passed down over the next 15 years. However, this could change as footloose billionaires move around the world, motivated by a better quality of life, geopolitical concerns and tax considerations, UBS found. Various European governments have faced calls to introduce a wealth tax on the international elite this year. In Switzerland, where UBS estimates that $206bn will be inherited over the next 15 years, voters on Sunday overwhelmingly rejected a proposed 50% tax on inherited fortunes of £47m or more. In October, the French parliament voted against a proposed 2% tax on fortunes over €100m. Italy, which has attracted many wealthy residents thanks to its flat-tax regime for foreign income, has set out plans to increase the levy by 50% to €300,000 a year from 2026. Meanwhile, the UK, which distanced itself from reports of a formal wealth tax over the summer, officially ended non-dom status this year under which UK residents who declared their permanent home as overseas could avoid paying UK tax on foreign income and gains. It also announced plans for a council tax surcharge, labelled a “mansion tax”, on homes worth more than £2m in last week’s budget. Last year, Spain, Brazil, Germany and South Africa signed a motion at the G20 for a minimum 2% tax on the super-rich to reduce inequality and raise public funds. Forecasts on its impact vary, but a study by the leading French economist Gabriel Zucman found it could net up to $250bn in extra revenue. The four countries have called on other governments to support the campaign, saying a levy on the ultra-wealthy would complement negotiations on the taxation of the digital economy and continuing efforts to bring in a global minimum corporate tax of 15% for multinational businesses. • This article was amended on 4 December 2025. Because of an error in the UBS report, an earlier version said there are 9,919 billionaires around the world this year. This figure has been corrected to 2,919."

In this week’s newsletter we have charts on the revenue required to pay for all this AI infrastructure, how natural disasters are distorting the US home insurance market, and how much little sex gen Z is having. But first … whither group voting tickets? In Australia, Victoria is the last state still using group voting tickets (GVTs) to elect its upper house. This is where voters can vote “above the line” for a party, which then gets to decide where the vote goes after the party’s candidates are eliminated. GVTs have long been exploited, with backroom deals between parties allowing little-known candidates to leapfrog rivals who received far, far more primary votes. As happened in 2018: With Victoria’s electoral matters committee recommending group voting tickets be abolished this week, we took a deep dive into what exactly they are, and what the various options are to replace them and reform the system. Four charts from the fortnight *** 1. An incredible loss Julian Fell and Georgina Piper at the ABC have a devastating story of a man who lost more than US$180k gambling in a crypto casino, including more than US$40k in just eight days: Content warning: the ABC story contains references to suicide. Elsewhere the ABC also had this dire story about rental affordability and some nice charts using the latest wave of the Australian Election Study. *** 2. Harder and harder to insure In 2020, about 222,000 Californian homes were covered by state-run or state-backed insurers of “last resort” as private companies wouldn’t cover them. With many of these homes increasingly prone to natural disasters, that number jumped by more than 100,000 in 2023. Reuters have a wonderfully designed visual story looking at how climate change is driving this trend and how these non-profit insurers may be feeding a vicious cycle. *** 3. Stacks on stacks on stacks There’s been a rich vein of charts looking at the “AI bubble” recently, but this one from the Washington Post really caught our attention: It’s not just because its a bar chart – The Crunch’s chart of choice. But that, according to JP Morgan, the tech industry will need an extra US$650bn in revenue every year just to earn a 10% return on all this investment. For context, Google’s 2024 revenue was US$350bn and OpenAI has annual revenues of about US$20bn. *** 4. More distribution charts, please A lot of fancy graphics focus on means and medians and other summary stats, hiding all the nuance of the actual distribution of the data.

news_2025_dec_05_weather-watch-everyday-phrases-nautical-expressions-wind-language.txt,news,2025-12-05,David Hambling,‘Three sheets to the wind’: how everyday phrases blew in from the sea,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/05/weather-watch-everyday-phrases-nautical-expressions-wind-language,"Some everyday expressions have an obvious nautical origin such as “all at sea” and “an even keel”. But plenty of others have slipped into the language unnoticed, including a number derived from how sailors talked about the wind. Surprisingly, “overbearing” was originally a nautical term, meaning having an advantage over another ship by carrying more canvas safely and so being able to sail faster. The expression came to be used metaphorically to describe an approaching storm or anything else that could not be outrun. Similarly to “bear down” on something was to approach forcefully with the wind behind. “Veering”, from the French “virer”, meaning to turn, was first applied to the change in direction of the wind. Specifically, it means a movement clockwise. A wind that shifts anticlockwise, say from north to west, is “backing” rather than veering. “By and large” originally referred to a ship alternately sailing as close to the wind as possible, known as sailing “by the wind”, and sailing in the direction the wind is blowing in. The expression came to mean under most conditions, or in general. These expressions are amphibians that have moved from the sea to exist on land, leaving behind all traces of the ocean winds and making themselves at home in suburbia."

news_2025_nov_02_mps-urge-minister-to-adopt-definition-of-islamophobia-amid-rise-in-hate.txt,news,2025-11-02,Geneva Abdul,MPs urge minister to adopt definition of Islamophobia amid rise in hate crime,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/02/mps-urge-minister-to-adopt-definition-of-islamophobia-amid-rise-in-hate,"More than three dozen Labour and independent MPs have written to the housing secretary calling on the government to adopt a definition of Islamophobia, after recent figures revealed hate crimes against Muslims were up by nearly a fifth. Forty MPs, including Labour MPs Diane Abbott, Dawn Butler, Kim Johnson and independent Andrew Gwynne, were among the signatories on the letter from Afzal Khan who wrote to Steve Reed on Friday asking him to adopt a definition of anti-Muslim hatred as an “important step” in addressing discrimination, prejudice and hatred the community faces. “This comes at a time when unfortunately, Islamophobia continues to increase rapidly, with devastating consequences. In 2025, 45% of religious hate crimes were directed towards Muslims. This is a 19% increase,” the letter says. “This means Islamophobic hate crimes have risen 92% since 2023 and the adoption of a definition by the government becomes more important than ever.” In February, the government launched a working group to define “unacceptable treatment, prejudice, discrimination and hate targeting Muslims or anyone who is perceived to be Muslim”. It is understood the working group submitted its report earlier this month to Reed, laying out a nonstatutory definition of Islamophobia. Should it go ahead, the proposed definition is expected to be put to a consultation. Signatories urged Reed to adopt a definition during Islamophobia awareness month in November and to work with communities “who this definition is meant to protect”. Critics have raised concerns that the definition could limit freedom of speech and the ability to criticise Islam. The Guardian reported earlier this month that the new definition of Islamophobia being considered by ministers is understood to be expected to protect the freedom to criticise Islam. The working group on the anti-Muslim hatred/Islamophobia definition is chaired by barrister Dominic Grieve KC, who served as attorney general for England and Wales between 2010 and 2014, and comprises experts and academics such as Akeela Ahmed, a co-chair of the British Muslim Network, and cross-bench peer Shaista Gohir. Earlier this month, Gohir, who also leads the Muslim Women’s Network, criticised ministers for being “silent” after government figures showed in England and Wales, where 3.9 million people identify as Muslim, anti-Muslim hate crime rose from 2,690 offences to 3,199 in the 12 months to March 2025. In 2019, the Labour party adopted a working definition of Islamophobia from the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on British Muslims, which included the statement: “Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness”. The definition was adopted by many organisations including the Labour party, Lib Dems and Scottish Conservatives, but the Westminster government and Conservative party did not follow suit, saying the definition had “not been broadly accepted” and needed further consideration. Under the Equality Act 2010, Islam is protected as a religion but Muslims are not defined as a racial group, so are not covered by protection against racial discrimination. In 2016, the government adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism, which has been taken up by the main UK parties. Khan, who has campaigned against Islamophobia for more than 25 years – and for more than 10 of which he has been calling for a definition of Islamophobia – said the Labour government “cannot let the momentum slip” after it established a working group in February. “Muslims receive the highest number of recorded religious hate crimes in the UK,” said Khan, adding that the figures reflect an “aggressive shift” in the acceptable rhetoric fuelled by the far right. “We urgently need a robust definition that protects people while preserving free speech,” said the MP for Manchester, Rusholme. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: “The department is carefully considering the Working Group’s recommendations and we will respond in due course.”"

news_2025_nov_05_the-long-wave-hurrican-melissa-caribbean.txt,news,2025-11-05,Nesrine Malik,‘At the mercy of nature’: how the Caribbean is dealing with the unprecedented Hurricane Melissa,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/05/the-long-wave-hurrican-melissa-caribbean,"It has been one week since Hurricane Melissa made landfall. The storm’s strength has been record-breaking. To better understand the situation on the ground, I called up Natricia Duncan, the Guardian’s Caribbean correspondent, who is based in Jamaica, the country most affected. We spoke about the impact of the hurricane, and how people navigate living under constant climate precariousness. *** The fears, fallout and future Hurricane Melissa was a historic climate event. “This country has faced some difficult storms,” Natricia said, “but by all accounts this was different. I spoke to people in their 60s and they said to me, again and again, ‘I have never heard anything like this in my life’.” Last week, Natricia visited one of the most affected areas in the south-west of Jamaica. “It’s hard to put into words,” she said about what she saw. “It’s hard to do justice to the damage that I saw on the way to St Elizabeth. The area was cut off from the rest of Jamaica due to landslides, flooding, debris.” As she was driving through a river, she realised it was actually not a body of water but flooding. “Almost every single building had suffered some level of damage,” she said. “People were telling us there used to be a shop here or a restaurant there and now there is nothing, not even evidence” that these places existed. Residents told her they don’t know where the structures went, other than “probably in the ocean”. *** Humour in the face of a hurricane The buildup as Hurricane Melissa made its way towards the islands was unusually long. “Being here on the ground,” Natricia said “I was terrified. My stomach was in knots for two days. By all accounts this was going to be terrible. As one minister said, ‘How do you prepare yourself for something like this?’ You are at the mercy of nature. Waiting for it was really difficult. We had more notice than normal because it was moving so slowly.” The anticipation of the hurricane also inspired some dark humour as Jamaicans posted memes and reels on social media, one of the ways the population coped. I ask Natricia how severe weather events have come to shape a nation’s and, indeed, an entire region’s psyche. “The death toll is significant for a small population,” she told me. “Every life lost is an unbearable tragedy.” The other main effect is the elimination of livelihoods and shelter, and the challenge of trying to sustain hope in the midst of climate calamity. *** Reaping what affluent nations have sown Climate change has increased the intensity of hurricanes through the warming of the ocean water in which they form. The result is slower buildups, and therefore more powerful storms and heavier rain loads. “There is a link” Natricia said, “the warming of the Atlantic Ocean is turbo-charging what would have been a much less intense storm.” There is an awareness in the region, she added, that climate change is partly responsible. But that link is not being made strongly enough where it counts. International climate change conferences are not factoring in the “lived experience, the fear, the trepidation of those living in the Caribbean”, and so the “urgency and change that needs to happen” is not forthcoming. “The more voices we have from the Caribbean, the more pressure there will be to do something about it.” There is also a growing campaign for industrial nations to share reconstruction and support efforts. “The emissions from climate change that are causing these effects” in the Caribbean, Natricia said, “are not coming from these regions.” The Caribbean, which is collectively responsible for only 1% of greenhouse gas emissions, is reaping what affluent states have sown. “There is a growing movement of climate change and slavery reparations” she said, one that argues that the reparations movement needs to include tackling the climate crisis. Arley Gill, the head of the Grenada Reparations Commission, pointed out that there was an “inescapable” link between the pursuit of justice for enslavement and justice for climate change. He previously told Natricia that “our climate change challenges can be traced to the Industrial Revolution. And the Industrial Revolution in Europe was fuelled by the Atlantic slave trade and slavery.” *** Fortifying the future The challenge now is to rebuild. In many instances, “you have to build a whole community from scratch” explained Natricia, who said some communities were hit by Hurricane Beryl last year and had just finished rebuilding their homes. “There is a mental health challenge – think about your child having to live through the roof of their houses being torn off. Those who have survived will be traumatised.” But there is also a colossal marshalling of efforts among the large Jamaican diaspora. Plans are being made for a number of fundraising concerts in a series named “I love Jamaica”, to be held in Jamaica and plans for concerts in Canada and the US. Meanwhile, Jamaican celebrities including the musician Shaggy have launched their own aid campaigns. Beyond rebuilding, what looms in the near distance is how to fortify. Natricia, who is from St Vincent and the Grenadines, articulated a growing, Caribbean-wide sense of the urgent need to future-proof communities. “Very few people across the Caribbean islands are not thinking about the future. We have all been touched by these hurricanes. Hurricane season is coming to an end, but it starts again on 1 June . We have that burden of thinking: how do I make sure I am safe? What more can I do to make sure of that in the coming years?” • To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday, please subscribe here."

But the haunting satellite image on our cover this week, of smoke billowing from fires near El Fasher’s airport, told its own story as starkly as anything that could be reported from the ground. Other satellite images showed clusters of burned-out vehicles, and what appeared to be pools of blood beside piles of bodies on the ground. A massacre was under way that could be seen from space. The last major city in Darfur to fall to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was already the scene of catastrophic levels of human suffering, but has “descended into an even darker hell”, senior UN officials warned last week. This key moment in the two-and-a-half-year-long civil war has unfolded in plain sight with minimal intervention from the international community, unless you count the United Arab Emirates, which has been arming the RSF paramilitaries. This week’s big story tells the tale of a massacre foretold, with detailed reporting from Rachel Savage and Carlos Mureithi, while Nesrine Malik’s scathing commentary challenges the world not to look away at a moment when hundreds of thousands of lives are at risk.

news_2025_nov_06_weatherwatch-will-st-martins-day-geese-predict-a-white-christmas.txt,news,2025-11-06,David Hambling,Weatherwatch: will St Martin’s Day geese predict a white Christmas?,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/06/weatherwatch-will-st-martins-day-geese-predict-a-white-christmas,"St Martin’s Day, 11 November, is associated with feasting and the beginning of preparations for winter. Like St Swithin’s Day, Martinmas was believed to indicate the weather ahead. Saint Martin, who is understood to have lived in fourth-century France, was associated with geese, having supposedly hidden in a goose pen to avoid being made bishop, only to be given away by their honking. Weather predictions from his day tend to have a flavour of goose. “If the geese at Martin’s Day stand on ice, they will walk in mud at Christmas” asserts one, adding that the reverse is said to be true if there is mud on St Martin’s. Geese are slaughtered for the Martinmas feast, supposedly the saint’s revenge for betraying him. According to medieval writer Johannes Hartlieb, the wishbone of the feast-day goose was carefully preserved by “the most sagacious” to foretell the winter ahead. “Thereby they divine whether the winter will be severe or mild, dry or wet,” wrote Hartlieb in 1455. “And are so confident in their prediction that they will wager their goods and chattels on its accuracy.” A military officer even told Hartlieb that the Teutonic knights relied on these goose-bone weather predictions when planning their military campaigns. Modern weather forecasters are more cautious about long-term predictions. But then, they do not have the backing of a saint."

news_2025_nov_07_uk-mosques-soaring-attacks-british-muslim-trust-flags-christian-nationalist-slogans.txt,news,2025-11-07,Chris Osuh Community affairs correspondent,Flags and Christian nationalist slogans feature in soaring attacks on UK mosques,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/07/uk-mosques-soaring-attacks-british-muslim-trust-flags-christian-nationalist-slogans,"Attacks on mosques in the UK have soared in recent months, the government’s Islamophobia monitoring partner has said, with more than 40% of incidents featuring British or English flags and Christian nationalist symbols or slogans. In the past three months, a mosque was set alight in East Sussex; in Merseyside the windows of a mosque were shot with an air gun while children were inside; in Greater Manchester, a paving slab was thrown at a window; and in Glasgow, a window was smashed with a metal pole. Data compiled by the British Muslim Trust (BMT) shows that between July and October, 25 mosques across Britain were targeted in 27 attacks – more than a quarter of which were violent or destructive. Other incidents included graffiti and the affixing of crosses and flags. Three mosques were targeted repeatedly. The BMT said 40% of incidents included the use of British and English flags or symbols and slogans including “Christ is king” and “Jesus is king” in a Christian nationalist context, reflecting how the hard right had attempted to weaponise Christian symbolism and idioms. In January, before the period examined in the data, there were seven attacks in London followed by a period of relative calm. Incidents across the country escalated in the summer – from one in July to eight in August, rising to nine in September and a further nine in October, the BMT said. The BMT was appointed by the government in July to track and respond to anti-Muslim hatred across the UK. Its report, A Summer of Division, has been seen by the Guardian. August marked a clear shift, with incidents evolving from “single acts of vandalism to coordinated symbolic intimidation and violent attacks – and repeat targeting, signalling a sustained increase in both scale and intent”, the report says. “While some framed this summer’s Raise the Colours campaign and the Unite the Kingdom rally as a call for national unity, this briefing confirms that, in practice, the two coincided with a wave of incidents in which the flag itself became an instrument of ethnonationalist intimidation to drive division.” The BMT said while the data could not establish direct causation, “the temporal correlation between these public mobilisations and the spike in mosque-targeted incidents is striking. It suggests that mainstream visibility of nationalist campaigns helped normalise or embolden anti-Muslim behaviour in local contexts”. The BMT is calling for UK statutory authorities to develop “rapid response” and security protocols for mosques, and to streamline the application process for security funding, as well as community cohesion education to emphasise mosques’ roles as “civic anchors”. The report says victims of anti-Muslim hate crimes consistently reported limited follow-up from police and online platforms, fuelling a perception that anti-Muslim hatred is tolerated or minimised. The BMT chief executive, Akeela Ahmed, said: “The evidence from this summer is incontrovertible: anti-Muslim hate in Britain is rising in both visibility and severity – and mosques are being targeted on a staggering scale. “This report must be a wake-up call – something has changed for the worse and, as a country, we need to put it right.” The Department for Communities and the Home Office have been approached for comment."
news_2025_nov_07_weatherwatch-reduced-european-snowfall-spells-disaster-for-skiing.txt,news,2025-11-07,Paul Brown,Weatherwatch: reduced European snowfall spells disaster for skiing,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/07/weatherwatch-reduced-european-snowfall-spells-disaster-for-skiing,"For a long time now it has been obvious the climate crisis is reducing snowfall across much of northern Europe. This is not of much consequence to most people, but to those who love skiing – and to the Swiss economy – it is a major blow. Snow-making machines are keeping the industry alive. For the first time the Swiss have been able to quantify their snow loss. Using measurements from 350 stations spanning 25 years – and some data going back to 1962 – the average loss of snowfall per decade has been 8cm. In the lower areas in the Swiss central plain there has been almost total loss of snow cover, but in higher mountains the snow depth has been much the same. The height of Swiss ski resorts in between those extremes varies enormously. They lie between 1,500 metres and the highest ski lift at 3,600 metres. These figures spell potential future economic disaster for those lower down, since snow-making machines are expensive to operate – sometimes as much as 50% of a resort’s energy costs. The Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, based in Davos in Switzerland, is sharing the information with all the business aspects of the ski industry, including cable cars, and is also incorporating it in apps for tourists to predict local skiing conditions."

news_2025_nov_11_the-crunch-the-decline-of-australian-childrens-tv-rivers-in-the-sky-and-where-is-western-europe.txt,news,2025-11-11,Nick Evershed and Josh Nicholas,The Crunch: the decline of Australian children’s TV; rivers in the sky; and where is western Europe?,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/11/the-crunch-the-decline-of-australian-childrens-tv-rivers-in-the-sky-and-where-is-western-europe,"Hello and welcome to another edition of The Crunch! In this week’s newsletter we have charts on how long it takes to get to space, the long recovery faced by people in Gaza after the ceasefire, differing views on what constitutes “western Europe”, how the US census measures race, and how special planes are used to measure hurricanes. But first … the decline of Australian children’s TV Streaming services such as Netflix, Stan and Disney+ may be forced to produce Australian content if the Albanese government’s long-awaited legislation passes parliament this week. Arts lobby groups are cautiously optimistic that the changes will lead to an increase in Australian drama, kids’ TV shows and documentaries being made. As this chart shows, after quotas specific to children’s shows, drama and documentary programs were removed in 2020 by the Coalition government, children’s TV production hit an all-time low of just 35 hours of content in the 2023-24 financial year: You can see a time-lapse of the construction of the Lego chart here. Entirely unrelated to kids TV or Lego, we ran an analysis last week looking at Australian politics, where the net zero climate target has become a political fault-line. The data clearly shows the Coalition would be better off tacking back to the centre if they ever want to form government again. You can read more here. Five charts from the fortnight *** 1. Long road to recovery Palestinians in Gaza are faced with one of the biggest recovery efforts in the history of modern warfare, and they are equipped with only rudimentary tools – shovels, pickaxes, wheelbarrows, rakes, hoes and their bare hands. Our colleagues in the UK looked at the gruelling task of recovering the at least 10,000 bodies of Palestinians buried under more than 61m tonnes of debris. That amount of rubble is “20 times more than the combined mass of all debris generated by conflicts since 2008”, and the number of Palestinians killed and injured by unexploded bombs is rising. You can read more here. *** 2. How to measure a storm like Melissa Satellites can only capture so much data about big storms like Hurricane Melissa, which killed more than 70 people across the Caribbean last week, as well as causing billions of dollars in damage. Reuters have put together a visual explainer on “hurricane hunters” – planes that fly into the storms for hours on end to collect data. This is something we didn’t know existed. This story is an incredible mix of illustration, looping and step-through video taken from onboard an actual plane that flew into Melissa. See more here. *** 3. Deadly rivers in the sky Also on hurricanes, the Washington Post had this beautifully visualised feature investigating how global heating is fuelling more dangerous floods. The Post uses modelling to look at how and where there have been changes in integrated vapour transport (IVT), which is a measure of water vapour movement in the air. Increasing moisture levels are worsening flooding events, such as the devastating floods in Spain in 2024. *** 4. Where’s Wally western Europe? One of the trickiest things about making maps is that there is often disagreement about where and what things are. This is why one of our favourite genres of mapping contrasts different ideas about place. Sebastian Gräff from the European Correspondent has made a map in this vein – using datasets from various government and international institutions to ask “Where is western Europe?”. One of our favourite maps of this kind is this one from the New York Times a few years ago. It munges together thousands of reader submissions of what different parts of New York City are called. *** 5. The race question Pew Research Centre has put together a fascinating article on race in the US census that includes this neat side-swiping bar chart: Starting from the first census in 1790 – when “white males and females” made up 80.7% of the population, you can track through the evolution of both the census questions and responses. It was only in 2000 that Americans started being able to respond with more than one race when describing their racial identity. Read more here.

news_2025_nov_11_when-i-met-craig-he-was-13-and-homeless-i-still-thought-his-life-might-turn-around-i-was-tragically-wrong.txt,news,2025-11-11,Pamela Gordon,When I met Craig he was 13 and homeless. I still thought his life might turn around. I was tragically wrong,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/11/when-i-met-craig-he-was-13-and-homeless-i-still-thought-his-life-might-turn-around-i-was-tragically-wrong,"Craig was a runaway when I first met him. Missing from a local children’s home, he spent his days hanging out in Nottingham city centre. He had just turned 13 and he was tall for his age, easily recognisable with his blond hair, but he seemed invisible to the authorities. No one was looking for him or the other dozen children who congregated on the market square. Most of them had absconded from care, some were dodging school. A few, like Craig’s mate Mikey, just didn’t bother going home. The youngest runaway, Mark, claimed he’d been missing from foster care for months and had spent his 12th birthday on the run. They were glad to have found each other and for a week or so they slept together in an alleyway. Craig organised bedding. He had picked up some tips from the experienced rough sleepers, he told me, as he collected cardboard he’d stored behind a bin. “Keeps the cold off your bones,” he said, without confidence. That was his first taste of being homeless. It was 1998 and I was in Nottingham filming Staying Lost, a documentary series for Channel 4. The number of runaways in the UK was at crisis point. A Children’s Society report estimated that 100,000 children ran away every year. Our series set out to follow some, like Craig, who survived on the streets, existing outside the system. We documented his life as he stumbled from one precarious situation to the next. On the face of it, he seemed unfazed by the chaos around him. He was often quiet, watching as street dramas played out in front of him. It was difficult to read what he was thinking and just how lost he felt. Once in a while, Craig would catch the bus four miles up the road to the 1970s estate where he grew up. I went there with him one day, half hoping I would find out the truth about why he’d ended up in care in the first place. Craig was pleased to show me round his “manor” as he called it. Teenagers cruised up and down on bikes that were far too small for them and there were trainers strung up over telephone wires. “Thrown up there for a laugh. There’s not much to do round here,” Craig admitted, although he seemed genuinely pleased to be back. We went into his mum’s. And if I was expecting some clues to his past the carefully wiped surfaces and dusted ornaments gave nothing away. The house was full, he explained to me. His sister and her baby lived there although his older brother had his own place now. His mum made me a cup of tea, but had little to say to her youngest son. According to her, he was “a nightmare” and his antics, as she called them, were too much for her. He’d had his last chance and she’d put him in care. No one could deal with him, she told me. It was unclear how much anyone had tried. Our visit was short lived. If he’d ever had a room, it was no longer available. In fact, there was no sign left that he’d ever lived there. No point in sticking around when you don’t feel wanted. So 13-year-old Craig jumped on the bus back to town and began the search for where he would sleep that night. The novelty of a cardboard mattress had worn thin and Craig started to seek out more sheltered places to hide. He called me once from a half-derelict squat near the station. A bloke called Jock was letting him crash in an old armchair but it was too noisy to sleep. Mates of Jock’s turned up unannounced at all hours, with unexplained bloody noses and unpredictable tempers. When the weather was OK Craig tried “camping out” on the Forest recreation ground but it was too “on top” as he called it. The nearby red-light district was busy and punters cruising past made for an uneasy atmosphere. Shadows slipped in and out of the headlights and Craig knew that girls from the children’s homes were working there. He’d heard stories of young boys selling sex in the public toilets. It was the 90s and exploited children were still prosecuted and labelled as “child prostitutes” or “rent boys”. After a couple of nights, Craig headed back into town. Every now and again the police would come across Craig in the town centre and take him back to the children’s home. Protesting half-heartedly, he would allow himself to be put in the back of the van. A few hours later he’d be back. Nobody at the home stopped him leaving. And nobody asked what he was running from. “He was trying to escape,” Jodie Young told me recently. “You risk something worse happening to you when you run off but you still feel anywhere’s better than care.” Jodie had been spat out of the care system herself and at 18 she was addicted to heroin, putting in long hours begging near the Midland Bank cashpoint. She became an unlikely protector of Craig and the others, letting them stay at the flat she shared with her boyfriend, Dave, and their jack russell, Penny. “I knew they were scared,” she said. “I wanted to give them somewhere safe.” A few years earlier, Jodie had spent some time at Beechwood House, the residential home Craig was missing from. If anyone knew why he had run, it was Jodie. Neither of them talked about life in the home. Whatever the truth was, they had an unspoken understanding to bury it. For a while, Jodie’s flat was a safe place. They had proper mattresses on the floor and sometimes bought Pot Noodles to eat together in the evening. Jodie warned the young runaways against heroin, although she was losing that battle herself. Above all, there was a feeling that everyone in the flat was in the same boat. They’d been let down by everyone whose responsibility was to care for them. It was up to them to look out for each other. By the time filming was coming to an end, this temporary stability was over. Jodie and Dave had been evicted, the little dog, Penny, taken away and the flat boarded up. Now 14 and a good foot taller, Craig once more found himself with nowhere to go. Even the police had given up taking him back to care. It felt like a dangerous crossroads, so I took a chance and suggested a visit to his mum’s. After an awkward start she grudgingly agreed that he could stay on the sofa for a while. Rules were laid down, promises made and a spare duvet was found. But I didn’t hold my breath. Things didn’t work out and soon enough Craig called letting me know he was on the move again. * * * For 18 months, Craig had trusted us to film the reality of his life as a runaway, when suddenly Nottingham city council stepped in claiming they were responsible for him and we had no right. They sought an injunction to stop the documentary from airing but after a gruelling few days being cross-examined in the Royal Courts of Justice, the judgment went in our favour. Craig was entitled to have his story told and Staying Lost was broadcast in April 2000, when he was almost 16. I still hoped that things might turn around for him, but in the year after the film aired, the police started picking Craig up for minor crimes and before long he landed up in a young offender institution. I visited him during that first stint inside. He got me a cup of coffee from a machine in the corner of the visitors’ room. He had an idea of training to be a mechanic but first he’d have to find somewhere to live. He wasn’t sure how he’d manage that. He was almost a grown man by now, not a priority for housing. And statistics on the fate of care leavers were stacked against him. It wasn’t long before he knew his prison number by heart. At first he was still seeing how far he could take things. When he was about 19, he came up with the idea of robbing a small supermarket by pretending he had a gun in his pocket. The terrified cashier handed over the contents of the till and he legged it with the lot. But it wasn’t Craig’s style. He was back in the morning to turn himself in. “I just couldn’t get it out of my head,” he told a friend later. “I’d scared the life out of that woman and I couldn’t live with that.” Steven Ramsell first encountered him in 2004. “I have a memory of sitting opposite Craig in the old dingy Bridewell police station,” Ramsell, who is a solicitor advocate, told me. “He was one of the first people I represented. If you looked at the outer husk you’d see a shop thief, a pest. Yes, he’d commited a load of crime, but it was low level stuff, and it was the only thing he knew.” Craig drew the line at house burglary but had become expert at lifting phones and purses. By the time he was 25, Craig was a regular client and, according to Ramsell, almost incapable of functioning in modern society. “While I was out there I just did not know how to live normally,” Craig wrote to me in 2017 from HMP Nottingham. “I felt awkward and out of place all the time. It’s no excuse for the crimes I did. But I just don’t know where or how to start.” There were people who tried to help him in those early years. People who remembered him as a kid let him use the shower or get his head down for a few nights. Some let him stay longer. But then Craig would “pay back the favour” by filling the fridge with stolen food, the police would turn up at the door, patience would wear out, and he’d be on his way again. “Craig is his own worst enemy,” people would say. Over the next 10 years I often lost track of whether he was in or out. Then out of the blue I would answer my phone to an automated voice. “This call is from a person currently in a prison. All calls are recorded and may be listened to by a member of prison staff. If you do not wish to accept this call, please hang up now.” Then Craig would come on the line, explaining the complex mess of arrests and outstanding warrants, recalls and remand hearings that had resulted in him being locked up again. “How are you doing, Pam?” he would never fail to ask. And I would try to find little things to tell him, all too aware that he’d find it hard to imagine the life I led. He liked to hear where I’d been and how my family were and he knew I was relieved to hear from him. Often, he would ask me to send another DVD copy of Staying Lost. He was proud of the film. He always said it was the only thing he’d ever really finished. He tried to show it to prison officers and volunteers on the inside. I think he hoped that by watching it they would get some idea of how much he’d been through and that maybe one day someone would come up with the answer to how he could sort his life out. But officers were neither inclined nor equipped to ponder prisoners’ life stories. “You should make a follow-up documentary on me, Pam,” he’d often say. “That’d show people what it’s like, what happened to me next.” But TV had moved on. I was told by one executive that Craig just didn’t have a “TV face”. Time and again Craig would walk out of the prison gate with no address. He’d leave with the best intentions of going to see his probation officer. But those appointments were often fraught and filled with forms and applications he couldn’t handle. And they usually led to a dead end. So, he’d find a mate to stay with. Someone who was doing him a favour. I could sometimes hear the chaos of those places in the background if he called me. “It’s sound here,” Craig would reassure me. But things would soon unravel. I remember how often Craig lost his few possessions, left in a hostel or at a mate’s house. There was usually a stereo, a “really good one” that he’d not been able to carry. And always a pair of trainers he’d managed to leave behind, even though the ones he was wearing were ready for the bin. During one particularly freezing winter, his stuff was lost when he was transferred between jails and he was released into a bitter morning outside HMP Hull with nothing more than the regulation sweatshirt and trackies he was wearing. I’d called the prison and tried to ask them to find clothes for Craig but as usual it was impossible to get through. It was only thanks to the resourceful and dedicated chaplaincy team that someone was able to meet him at the gate with a coat and scarf from the lost property. No one wakes up in the morning and decides to become a heroin addict, Jodie once told me. And I’m certain it wasn’t a decision Craig made, but that’s what happened. During his longer stints in prison, he’d sometimes get on to a drug reduction programme and get clean. But drugs are easy to score behind bars, and all too often offered a way to cope. “I run back to the drugs,” Craig once wrote to me, “cos I know how to be a druggie, I know what I have to do, or have to act, where other situations I haven’t a clue. Things get too emotional for me. I even panic when I’m just attending appointments whether it’s the jobcentre or whatever I just panic in my head. I feel like I’m 13 years old again when I’m out.” * * * By the time he was 33, Craig had 170 offences on his record and was spending less and less time on the outside. “He was institutionalised,” Ramsell told me. He’d been round the system so many times. Any support he got was never strong enough to spark a change. “There should be another option, but there wasn’t,” Ramsell said. “And Craig always knew what was coming. Back on the merry-go-round.” So, in the spring of 2018 the door of Nottingham prison revolved for Craig again and he was back on the wing. During the months that followed, Craig was in touch more than usual. At the time, Nottingham was one of the worst prisons in the country. It had recently been issued an urgent notification from the chief inspector of prisons – essentially, the institution has been put into special measures. The tensions that had simmered on the wings for years had finally reached boiling point. Officers and prisoners felt unsafe. Drugs, especially the noxious synthetic cannabinoid spice, were freely available. Over an 18-month period, 12 prisoners took their own lives. “I don’t even escape my problems when I’m asleep,” Craig wrote from his cell. “I live a nightmare in the days and when I sleep. I just don’t know if I can cope no more. My head is a mess and the days are just getting worse for me. I want a rest from myself.” His phone calls became desperate, and his letters got longer. I worried if I didn’t hear from him every day. Chaplain John Seeney was instrumental in getting Craig through that sentence. “We have to hang in there with Craig,” Seeney would say to me. Every Tuesday, Craig would ask to be let off the wing to attend the prison chapel where Seeney and the small multifaith team offered a place to talk and be heard. Craig was there without fail and even started writing some poems singing the praises of the support he’d found. And, as if by way of a small miracle, when Craig was released in early 2019, Seeney managed to negotiate him a room in a house connected to a church group in Ilkeston, a small town outside Nottingham. I travelled up on the train and he met me from the station. He’d been swimming, he told me, and he’d been to the library to try to learn how to use a computer. He had the key to his shared house on a long string and opened the door. He had milk in the fridge, and he made me a cup of tea. We spent a normal afternoon in the sunny back yard, and I still have a photo of him with a glimmer of hope in his eye. Before I got the train home, he took me to the church where he was volunteering, helping with their daily pop-in cafe. The other volunteers, who were much older, busied themselves with an antiquated tea urn and plastic boxes full of biscuits. There was a confusion about the “tea-towel rota” and Craig stepped up and offered to take his turn. A woman handed over a plastic bag full of towels and dish cloths with a slightly quizzical look in her eye. I remember worrying as we left the church hall about whether he had a washing machine or knew how to use it. A few weeks later, there was trouble. Rules for ex-prisoners are tough and trust is hard won. He ended up being chucked out for inviting “friends” round and throwing a kettle across an empty room. No more cups of tea. He was recalled to prison. We often talked about that afternoon, and I always said that now he’d managed to live in his own place once, he could do it again. But although he listened, I believe he knew his chances were running out. * * * At 35, Craig was looking at a longer sentence than usual after the recall. On the positive side, it meant he might have access to some of the support that was unavailable during shorter stretches. A woman named Tara Tan had recently started working as an art psychotherapist in Nottingham, partly thanks to the efforts of the ever-resourceful John Seeney. The chaplain hoped that art therapy might be a good fit for Craig, helping him express things he couldn’t find words for. “He liked to use colour pencils,” Tan recalled. “He would colour in, and sometimes he would draw. But I think he used the space more for somewhere he could let out frustrations with no fear of judgment.” At the start, Craig told me he didn’t feel anything but numb and that worried him. “I’m closed off emotionally to everything,” he told me on the phone. “That’s been as far back as I can remember.” Tan noticed this, too. “He found it difficult to open up for fear of being hurt more,” she told me. “You need to make sure you leave the sessions on a positive because you’re sending someone back to the wing knowing they’ll be locked up in their cell alone.” Then in July 2019, while Craig was working with Tan, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse published its investigation into how Nottingham council had responded to allegations of sexual abuse from children in care. “For decades, children who were in the care of Nottinghamshire council suffered appalling sexual and physical abuse, inflicted by those who should have nurtured and protected them,” announced Prof Alexis Jay, chair of the inquiry. “Those responsible for overseeing the care of children failed to question the extent of sexual abuse or what action was being taken.” Beechwood House, where Craig had been placed between the ages of 13 and 14, received a special mention. Violence was common and sexually abusive staff members were allowed free rein. Children’s allegations were ignored. Beechwood had finally been shut down in 2006, seven years after Craig’s time there. It turns out that there had been an awful lot to run away from. * * * The last time I saw Craig in person was in autumn 2019. He invited me up to HMP Nottingham for a ceremony celebrating the end of a training course he’d completed on staying straight. In the 12 sessions he had been taught skills for “a life free from offending and drug misuse”. Although I was a bit unclear about what magic key Craig had been given to help him avoid his past mistakes, it was a proud day. John Seeney was there, of course, and Tara Tan. The governor made an appearance, and cake was served on paper plates. An ex-prisoner gave a talk about how you could turn things around, about how much was possible if you tried hard and wanted it enough. I watched Craig step up to receive his certificate as he smiled, half full of hope. But over the next few years, fresh starts became harder and ended sooner. There was a sense that time was running out. Earlier this year, on 10 May, Craig spent another birthday behind bars. I heard from him as usual just before he was released. “Hiya Pam, it’s me, Craig here on the pen. Well now, I’m officially 41. Just 16 more days to go till I’m back in the big wide world. I just hope it stays that way and I can finally get my life turned round …” In that email he said he was hopeful of getting somewhere to live when he got out at the end of May. He’d had an assessment for housing a few days before and thought that with the council’s help, for once, he wouldn’t be on the streets again. And so the countdown began to another release, another clean slate. He promised to call when he got to probation to sort his benefits out. By then he’d know his new address, he said. It wasn’t a surprise when he didn’t call. After a week or so of not hearing from him, the usual worry began. I called a few people in Nottingham to find out if anyone had seen him. No one had. So, I waited for him to show up as he always had before. Waited for him to call, probably from someone else’s phone, saying that he’d messed up his appointments or that he had no money for the bus to get to probation. Or that he’d just been sleeping for days and that he was sorry. The call never came. On the night of 29 June 2025, Craig was found dead. A passerby found him slumped on some steps outside a house, the police told me. He was only a mile from the alleyway where he had slept rough as a 13-year-old. * * * It’s not clear yet which new set of statistics Craig will be added to. He will definitely be counted in this year’s homeless deaths, which numbered 1,600 last year. And he might join the UK drug deaths total, which reached 5,565 last year, the highest number since records began in 1993. It’s possible that he was a casualty of synthetic opioids. The number of those deaths has almost quadrupled in England and Wales, from 52 in 2023 to 195 in 2024. Or perhaps the drugs that contributed to his death won’t be recorded at all. The Office for National Statistics admits that figures for drug misuse are more than likely undercounted. Whatever the case, statistics like this can only explain in the narrowest way why Craig died. I later found out that Craig had been released, that final time, into emergency accommodation, rather than the longer term residence he was hoping for. He’d been offered a bed through The Community Accommodation Service, which provides short-term housing for prisoners released with no fixed address. It’s a last resort when “nothing else has been achieved”, someone from the Probation Service told me. Craig had apparently burned most of his bridges with them. “He struggled to engage,” they said. “But there are a lot of unanswered questions.” I emailed Steven Ramsell and told him the news. “It was a sad day in our office,” Ramsell said when he called me later. He asked about the funeral and I told him that Craig’s immediate family had opted for a public health service, which would be arranged and paid for by the council. “A paupers’ funeral,” said Ramsell. “The final tragedy in a tragic life.” Craig’s cremation took place on 11 August. Not wanting it to go unmarked, John Seeney went and was allowed to say a few words. He told me he gave Craig’s coffin a little pat, as a goodbye from us all. Ten days later, Seeney and I organised a memorial for Craig inside Nottingham prison in the Chapel where Craig had found some sanctuary over the years. Jodie Young, Tara Tan and about 20 of the current inmates were there. Seeney had made an order of service on the chaplaincy printer. My photo of Craig smiling in that back yard in Ilkeston was on the cover. I brought in another photo of him from when he was 13. I remember the moment it was taken. Craig was talking about blackberry picking with another runaway. Even then, it had felt so distant from the life he was living. We stood it on the chapel altar in a glassless frame. A couple of the prisoners stood up and shared memories of Craig. One, Jayden, who remembered robbing crack houses with him, shook his head in amazement that he’d survived a chaotic life on the streets and Craig had not. We laughed as people recounted the wilder stories from Craig’s life, like the time he leapt off a bridge while being chased by police and fortunately landed on a passing train. He always maintained to the chaplain that God had scheduled it to arrive just in time. Jodie was too upset to speak. After 30 years of heroin use, she will mark her two-year anniversary of being clean this December. She works as a drugs peer mentor. “My heart feels like it’s been smashed to pieces,” she told me quietly. “What’s the point of me volunteering at drug services and helping save people’s life when I can’t even save the people I care about?” Craig used to say how he’d love to donate his body to science, how they’d learn a lot from him. “It’s just that I wouldn’t know anything about it, Pam,” he used to laugh. And it’s true that no stone is being left unturned to try to work out what combination of longtime drug use, poor health, despair or neglect killed him in the end. The postmortem is under way, and an inquest is planned. In an extremely unusual move, the pathologist has retained the whole of Craig’s brain to enable them to carry out a detailed examination. So many resources are being spent now that he’s gone. In the chapel, Seeney played some music, a kind of mystical South American track which felt strangely comforting and we sat in silence with our own memories. As we got ready to leave that afternoon and officers were called to take the prisoners back to the wings I thought about how Craig would feel to see us all here. That he’d never believe how missed he is. • The best stories take time.

news_2025_nov_12_from-kenya-to-madagascar-the-african-countries-struggling-to-escape-old-politics.txt,news,2025-11-12,Nesrine Malik,"From Kenya to Madagascar, the African countries struggling to escape old politics",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/12/from-kenya-to-madagascar-the-african-countries-struggling-to-escape-old-politics,"It has been a month of political upheaval in some African countries. But it is a period of political action that feels less like a season, and more like the new normal. This week, I try to pull together the strands of what is unfolding. “All generalisations are false” goes the old saying, “including this one”. African politics is never uniform, but there are patterns and commonalities among some countries with similar demographic and economic profiles. Over the past year, there have been a number of protests, including in Kenya, Morocco, Cameroon, Madagascar and, most recently, Tanzania. Protesters are overwhelmingly from younger generations, particularly gen Z, and the price that they have paid is high. In Tanzania, anger that erupted after an election that excluded opposition candidates from the ballot has been met with a deadly crackdown. Reports of death tolls so far vary, but estimates are staggering, exceeding 1,000 people killed by security forces. In Kenya, scores have been killed and hundreds detained in rolling protests over the past year and a half that were triggered by economic policies and police brutality. For these two countries in particular, demonstrations and the response to them have shattered long periods of stability, suggesting not a sudden explosion but a buildup that has resulted in clashes between the public and the government. *** A stubborn old guard The protesters’ complaints are universal and about basic rights – the rising cost of living, power and water outages, lack of political freedoms, and rigged elections. Zoom out, though, and it becomes clear that these frustrations are about a growing gap between people and power. Some of Africa’s old guard are literally that: old. They preside over countries where the median age is 19. Last week, Cameroon’s Paul Biya, 92, was sworn in for an eighth consecutive term, after violence in a contested election. He is the world’s oldest president, leading a country in the world’s youngest continent. Rumoured to be too frail to campaign in person, he appeared to send a bizarre walking effigy of him and his wife out on the campaign trail. (I don’t know if there is a more fitting metaphor.) The only leader who exceeded him in age was Robert Mugabe, who was president of Zimbabwe until he was deposed in a coup aged 93, and died at 95. There are now several African leaders over the age of 80. The absence of term limits is clearly a problem, with even new leaders finessing the system to guarantee long tenure. Ivory Coast’s Alassane Ouattara, 83, just started his fourth presidential term. *** Mixed results It’s not all a story about suppression and election upheaval. There are stable democracies such as Ghana, Namibia and Botswana. And protests in some instances have achieved breakthroughs. In Kenya, president William Ruto, a broadly intransigent and fiery politician, set the police on protesters objecting against a finance bill with high tax hikes. “Violence and anarchy”, he said, would not be tolerated. Within days, in a stunning about-face, he withdrew the bill and said: “I concede” because “the people have spoken”. In Madagascar, protests that began in late September against utility scarcity quickly expanded into outright uprising. Just over two weeks later, the president had fled, and the military came out on the side of the protesters, leading to heady jubilation and celebration of gen Z because, as a 17-year-old told the Guardian: “It was them who gave us the victory.” But clouds are gathering. Ruto remains deeply unpopular, and sporadic protests still arise. In Madagascar, there is a chilling portent of what has taken place in countries such as Sudan. A transitional military government is already being accused of non-transparent appointments, and is being monitored for threats of revolution hijack. Sudan’s 2019 revolution, which toppled president Omar al Bashir, who had ruled for almost 30 years, was a colossal moment of hope for the country, only for the revolution to be midwived by military forces, and then fully reversed as a military coup against civilians led the country to a devastating war between armed parties. *** Patronage networks and an unsustainable status quo If you had told me, as a Sudanese celebrating in those magical moments in 2019, that the country would be where it was today, I would have thought that it was a profound tragedy. Now I see there was some inevitability to it. Despite all of the frustration, energy and promise of younger generations desperate for change – and in many instances ready to put their lives on the line for it – what they are up against is no single leader, but entire embedded institutions, oligarchies and patronage networks. Behind every leader there is, perhaps, an army that will not cede power to civilians easily, or a business class that has much to lose from the dismantling of their corrupt lucrative political arrangements. Every government at odds with its people is not about a single president or party, but a complex web of arrangements that benefit just enough people to make change undesirable: such as the member of parliament with a nice sideline in import and export, or the industrialist who has negotiated a favourable tax deal. The fact that some African countries are still open to backsliding feels like it has sort of unexpectedly heaved into view. And that is because, no matter how positive the trends are in terms of appetite for transformation and demographics, the problem is the system, not politicians. But what is becoming clear in this moment is that we are entering an era in which the contradictions between ordinary people and those who hold all forms of power are too sharp for the status quo to be tenable any more. • To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday, please subscribe here."

But a week on, the scale of his achievement looks no less impressive. As Ed Pilkington outlines in this week’s big story, Mamdani swept away his establishment-backed heavyweight opponent Andrew Cuomo by mobilising an army of grassroots volunteers and donors, while also connecting deeply with the voters whose support he most needed on the issues that mattered most to them, namely affordability and economic justice. It’s a ground-up approach to doing things that US Democrats – who also won governorships in Virginia and New Jersey on an encouraging night – can learn from as they reflect on a torrid year since Donald Trump swept to power. There are some who fear the young Muslim mayor-elect could prove to be a gift for Republicans. As Jonathan Freedland warns, the man Trump calls a “100% communist lunatic” is likely to be targeted mercilessly in the run-up to the US midterms next November. Democrats, on the other hand, believe they can exploit Mamdani’s affordability message by tailoring it to different sets of voters. Who will turn out to be right? It’s going to be a nerve-racking year as we wait to find out, but Mamdani has at least given US progressives reason to believe once again.

news_2025_nov_12_uk-denial-hostage-taking-foreign-states-says-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe.txt,news,2025-11-12,Patrick Wintour and Geneva Abdul,"UK in denial over hostage-taking by foreign states, says Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/12/uk-denial-hostage-taking-foreign-states-says-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe,"The UK government is in denial about the extent of hostage-taking by foreign states and has failed to fulfil its promise to appoint a special envoy to combat the problem, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has said. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was kept in an Iranian jail for six years on bogus espionage charges until her release in March 2022, was speaking at a conference dedicated to eradicating the growing international practice of hostage-taking. “The government has a moral duty of care for each and every citizen who is arbitrarily detained abroad,” she said. “That duty should be fair. Unfortunately, the government’s policy in such cases is discretionary. If you are not made a priority to them, you run the risk of being left behind.” The conference heard widespread disillusionment from hostage families that the UK had still not acted to marshal the resources of government to make the release of British nationals a true diplomatic priority, including by providing systematic advice and sustenance to families of those arbitrarily detained. Speaking at the conference, Joe Bennett, the son of Lindsay Foreman – currently held in an Iranian jail on spying charges – revealed that the Foreign Office had advised him not only not to go public about his mother’s capture, but also not to contact other families that had been in parallel crises. He reported that his mother felt let down, and was currently on hunger strike. He said he was willing to join her on the strike if it helped. “I think the biggest battle is fighting the government to get them to do something … which shouldn’t be the case,” he said. “It feels though at the moment that we’re at a bit of a stalemate. I think we as a nation and government should be taking that front foot and addressing it for what it is.” The Labour manifesto made a commitment to provide a right to a consular assistance in human rights cases, but no legislation has emerged. The previous foreign secretary David Lammy said before the summer that the appointment of an envoy would be made by the end of the year. But there are concerns that the envoy may not have access to the UK prime minister, or the powers given to the US envoy for hostages. A recent executive order has given the US president powers to designate a state as a hostage-taking state. Zaghari-Ratcliffe noted that after her case, the UK’s foreign affairs select committee had organised an inquiry examining how the government handled hostage situations. “It is a still-neglected policy area,” she said. “One of the recommendations was to establish a hostage envoy … The foreign secretary personally met with us to explain how important it was to him. However, the hostage envoy has not yet been established. There has been no improvement in the UK government approach to deal with hostage taking. It feels we are still in the denial phase.” Recounting her prison experience, she said: “I kept telling myself, surely my life meant a lot to many, if not to the states involved, so those many will help me out. I also thought, surely no government would take a woman and a baby hostage. That is just cruel. But I was wrong. The politics I was inadvertently stuck in between was ruthless and brutal.” Caoilfhionn Gallagher, a KC and a human rights barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said: “It’s something shocking when you hear what Nazanin said when she was paraded on stage at the Labour party conference before the election with the Labour government saying: we’re going to do things better. And now here we are a year and a half on, and I can tell you, as someone who’s worked in this field for 25 years, it doesn’t feel better. It doesn’t feel different. It feels like we’re having exactly the same fights.”"

news_2025_nov_13_survivors-tadamon-massacres-justice-syria.txt,news,2025-11-13,Melvyn Ingleby,‘We were forced to burn bodies’: will survivors of the Tadamon massacres see justice?,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/13/survivors-tadamon-massacres-justice-syria,"Abu Mohammed still remembers the smell. It usually came at dawn, as the mosques sounded the first call to prayer. By the time he sat down for breakfast, it would fill the air around his home in Tadamon, a working-class district in the south-east of Damascus. The smell was hard to define. Whenever he noticed it, Abu Mohammed felt on edge. He had his suspicions about what it might be, but like so many Syrians who lived under the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad, he knew to keep such thoughts to himself. Abu Mohammed, a retired engineer who asked to be identified only by his nickname, first noticed the smell in the winter of 2012, nearly two years after the start of the uprising against Assad. At the time, he was living in a modest flat in the heart of Tadamon with his wife and their five children. The house stood just off a busy road named Daboul Street. Before the fighting started, Abu Mohammed enjoyed sitting on his balcony after work, sipping his tea as he watched the yellow minicabs and honking motorbikes compete for space in the streets below. But by the time the smell became noticeable, these streets were largely deserted. The Assad regime had rolled out a network of checkpoints across the neighbourhood in an attempt to quell protests after the 2011 uprising. Hiding behind a curtain so he wouldn’t be seen, Abu Mohammed watched soldiers patrolling the streets. He also noticed white minibuses driving up and down Daboul Street. Whenever the minibuses passed by, he would hear gunfire later that day. Then, overnight, that same smell. One of his daughters, who was in her early teens at the time, remembers it, too. “It smelt like burning hair,” she recalled. “Or like a piece of meat that has been left in a pan until it melts.” Nearly a decade later, in April 2022, the Guardian published a video that revealed the source of the smell. The footage carried a date tag from April 2013 and was geolocated to Tadamon. It showed two men in military fatigues next to a white minibus. One of the soldiers could be seen pulling a civilian, blindfolded, out of the van and dragging him towards a large pit filled with bodies and car tyres. The other stood by the edge of the pit with an assault rifle. Calmly, he pushed his victim into the pit and executed him as he fell on to the other victims. They did this time after time. When 41 people lay dead, the shooter took a jerrycan of fuel, poured it over the tyres and the bodies, and set the pit on fire with a burning rag attached to a wooden stick. The footage was part of a collection of videos leaked by a source inside Syria and obtained by two genocide scholars in Amsterdam, Annsar Shahhoud and Uğur Ümit Üngör. The researchers shared a selection of the material with the Guardian and submitted the rest to European war crime prosecutors. In total, the videos document the killing of 288 civilians by Assad’s forces, the academics concluded, including seven women and 12 children. One of the scholars, Shahhoud, managed to identify the main shooter seen in the video. His name is Amjad Youssef and he served as an officer in Branch 227 of the Assad regime’s military intelligence. Using a fake Facebook account in which she posed as a regime loyalist, Shahhoud sent him a friend request, gained his trust over several phone calls, and lured him into confessing his crimes. When she confronted him with the video, he replied: “I am proud of my deeds.” As long as Assad was still in power, no one in Tadamon dared to mention the video in public. According to Abu Mohammed, Youssef remained in the neighbourhood after the video was published, as if nothing had happened. “He would just drive up and down the street on his motorbike. No one would say anything.” But now that the dictator is gone, the people of Tadamon are breaking their silence. As they have begun to share their stories, it is becoming clear that the atrocities in the neighbourhood were far worse than initially reported – and involved many more perpetrators besides Youssef. Between March and August this year, I visited Tadamon multiple times and spoke with more than 20 residents. Abu Mohammed, a short elderly man with a soft smile, was one of the first people I met. As soon as he noticed me in the street, he grabbed my arm. “I stayed here throughout the war,” he said. “If you want to know what really happened here, follow me.” We sat in the family living room, and Abu Mohammed’s wife served cardamom coffee and sweets as the father and daughter recalled the moment they first saw the video on social media. “We immediately made the connection,” the daughter said. “This was the gunfire we used to hear, and it explained the smell. We even recognised some of the victims. They were people we saw regularly on the streets.” The video captures only a fraction of the slaughter Assad’s forces unleashed upon Tadamon, Abu Mohammed said. To him and many other residents I spoke to, the killing of civilians in Tadamon was not a single event. For years, he said, he saw the minibuses drive up and down the street, sometimes as often as two or three times a week. The smell of burning bodies, he and his daughter recalled, kept returning, too, from the very end of 2012 until at least 2015. Random killings and arrests continued long after. Assad’s forces may have killed not hundreds of civilians in Tadamon, but thousands. Nearly a year after Assad’s fall, the people of Tadamon have seen very little justice for these crimes. While Youssef is widely rumoured to have fled the country, many other perpetrators are still in the neighbourhood. “We don’t feel safe,” an elderly man named Ghassan, who lost his brother in the massacres, told me. “I can walk down the street here and shake someone’s hand, and that same person might be the one who killed my brother.” * * * Abu Mohammed took me on a tour of the neighbourhood. We started on Daboul Street, which divides the district into two parts. To its west is a labyrinth of narrow alleyways that still buzz with life. Here, children chase each other with toy guns, street vendors push wooden carts stacked with fresh fruit and neighbours argue with one another from their balconies. To its east lies a wasteland filled with piles of rubble and the ruins of bombed out apartment blocks. “This is where the smell came from,” Abu Mohammed said as he stepped into the ruined area. He took me to the spot near Daboul street where the executions were filmed. The children playing in the rubble began re-enacting the massacre as soon as they noticed me. “This is how he killed him!” one 10-year-old boy shouted, waving his imaginary rifle. “I saw it myself on YouTube.” “There are many more mass graves in this area,” Abu Mohammed said as he took me deeper into the wasteland, an area the size of more than 50 football fields. Inside one destroyed building, he showed me a shallow crater filled with human bones, including a skull, bits of a spine and smaller bones which may have belonged to children. As we stood there, some stray dogs howled in the distance. “Those dogs keep digging up bones,” the elderly man said. “That’s how many mass graves were found.” On the first floor of another building nearby, we saw a metal bar hanging from the ceiling of a room with pink walls covered in graffiti left by Assad’s forces. We spoke to a man holding his young son by the hand, who told us he used to live here until the regime took his house and turned it into a torture site. “They would hang people from that metal bar and cut their wrists,” he said. Many of the people killed here, Abu Mohammed said, were simply dumped in the wasteland below or stacked into empty buildings which were subsequently bombed. “That’s how they hid the evidence,” he said, pointing at the piles of rubble around him. Since there has been no effort yet to exhume this area, many relatives of the victims still have no idea what happened to their loved ones, let alone a grave to mourn them. As we returned to Daboul Street, Abu Mohammed showed me a last location which he said played a crucial part in the regime’s killing machine: a small mosque with a bullet-riddled minaret. The Othman bin Affan mosque stands on the border between the parts of Tadamon that are still intact and the rubble beyond. “This is where the minibuses drove to,” he said. “When I passed it one day in 2014 with my nine-year-old daughter, we saw piles of corpses lying outside.” The caretaker of the mosque is Naji, a slender elderly man with a long beard. He took me down to the basement, which he said was used as a torture site. Some bones still lay on the floor. “After the liberation we found a noose hanging from the ceiling,” the old man said, shaking his head. “How could they do such a thing in the house of God?” * * * It was in front of this same mosque that Malek Moustafa first climbed on to the shoulders of his friend, on 25 April 2011, to demand the fall of the regime. The imam had called for a protest in solidarity with the people of Daraa, a city in the south of Syria, where Assad’s security forces had tortured a group of young people for writing “freedom” and “down with the regime” on the walls of a school. “Something came out of me that day that never went back inside,” Moustafa, 43, told me in July, in a small one-room building in the heart of Tadamon, where he sat chain smoking red Gauloises. On that spring day in 2011, he had just turned 29. He was not particularly political nor religious. He spent many of his nights going out with his friends, who were not just Sunni Muslims like himself, but also Alawites, Christians, Druzes and Ismailis. “At the time, we didn’t care much what sect people belonged to,” he said. According to Moustafa, that sense of community across different sects was typical of the Tadamon of his childhood. Sometimes referred to as “little Syria”, the neighbourhood is home to practically all of Syria’s ethnic and religious groups. In Arabic, its name means “solidarity”, a reference to the welcome this district provided to Syrians displaced from the Golan Heights following Israel’s illegal occupation of the area in 1967. But that old solidarity was about to fracture. As Moustafa and other protesters gathered in front of the mosque in 2011, they were beaten up by a group of “shabiha”. This derogatory term, which literally translates as “ghosts”, refers to regime loyalists, mainly Alawites, who received money and favours from the intelligence services to crush dissent. One man who played a crucial role in mobilising the shabiha was a local Alawite, then in his mid-30s, who everyone in Tadamon still talks about. His real name is Fadi Ahmad, but he is better known as Fadi “Saqr” – Fadi the Falcon. According to Moustafa and other residents, Saqr set up so-called “popular committees”, groups of shabiha who were given weapons and salaries to attack the protesters. As the demonstrations continued, the activist was shocked to see some of his friends sign up. “These were the same people I used to play football with. One of them was one of my best friends, we even used to pray together,” said Moustafa. “But when I ran into him shortly after the revolution began, he asked me: ‘If we meet in battle one day, would you ever kill me?’ I answered: ‘Of course not.’ And then he said: ‘I would kill you.’” To organise themselves, Moustafa and his friends set up an activist network named the Tadamon Coordination Committee. After a regime sniper killed an 11-year-old boy at a demonstration, the activists also began to pick up arms, and were joined by defectors from the army and police. Street-to-street fighting followed, and by early 2012, much of Tadamon was under rebel control. The district was of key strategic importance. It is located next to crucial highways and serves as a gateway to Damascus’s southern countryside, where the rebels had become a serious force. To its west lies the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk, another rebel stronghold. To prevent these fronts from linking up and halt the rebel advance from the south, the regime had to win Tadamon back. In the summer of 2012, it launched a major counteroffensive. Moustafa said he was not a fighter at the time, but was constantly with the rebels, helping provide them with weapons and medical supplies. In one heavy battle in early August, he was standing right behind his brother Bilal when a regime sniper killed him. Moustafa buried him close to the Othman bin Affan mosque, wrapped in a flag of the Syrian revolution which Bilal, a tailor, had sewn himself. Aside from the army, Assad also sent the shabiha into battle. From mid-2012, onwards, they were incorporated into a paramilitary force called the National Defence Force (NDF). Fadi Saqr helped set up the NDF in Tadamon and later became its commander in all of Damascus. He also joined the battlefield himself: in November 2012, he appeared in a regime propaganda video on YouTube, surrounded by soldiers and a tank firing into Tadamon’s narrow alleyways. That same month, Moustafa was arrested. He and his friend Mohammed were on their way to Yarmouk, but ran into a checkpoint and were taken to Branch 235 of Assad’s military intelligence, one of the most notorious torture prisons in the country. “We were tortured there for eight months,” Moustafa said. “I could hear Mohammed’s screams echo through the building.” * * * Moustafa was released in June 2013 as part of a prisoner swap. Since Tadamon was by now under regime control, he joined rebel forces south of the neighbourhood. He would remain there until 2018, when the rebels lost their territory and withdrew to the north-western province of Idlib. From a distance, Moustafa noticed black smoke rising above Tadamon and smelled something strange. “The men stationed on the frontline could even hear screaming and the sounds of bullets,” he said. “It didn’t make any sense to us, because the regime was in full control of that area. Only later it became clear to us that the regime was carrying out an ethnic cleansing against the Sunnis in the area.” Many civilians fled Tadamon, but Abu Mohammed decided to stay. Though a Sunni himself, he said his job as an engineer at a public utilities company and the ID that went with it gave him relative leeway at checkpoints. In any case, he had already had his share of displacement in life. “I was seven years old when Israel invaded my home on the Golan Heights,” he said. After that experience, he refused to become a refugee again. The neighbourhood was now ruled by a mix of NDF members, regular soldiers and members of Branch 227 of the military intelligence. Most of the NDF members, Abu Mohammed said, were the type of guys you would want to avoid even before the uprising. Some used to work as bouncers in casinos, others were drug dealers or had spent time in prison. To these men, the NDF was a route to the power they had long craved. During these years, Abu Mohammed’s family tried to stay at home as much as possible and the children were not allowed to play outside. But one of their teenage sons would sometimes go missing all day and only come back late in the evening. One time, his mother noticed a footprint on his back, as if he had been kicked. “He told me the NDF had taken him to build a dirt wall,” his mother told me in March. “He was very scared and didn’t dare to talk about it.” When I returned to see Abu Mohammed’s family in late May, this son was visiting his family for Eid. He is now in his early 30s and it was his first time back in Tadamon since he fled Syria in 2015 and crossed the Mediterranean in a dinghy to reach Europe. Abu Mohammed and I were talking in the living room as he entered and sat down next to his father. When I explained the topic of our conversation, the young man looked nervous, but soon joined us and began to reveal his secret. To protect his identity, he asked to be identified as Ahmed. The paramilitaries of the NDF would take him in the morning, Ahmed said. Usually, they grabbed him at the bus stop on his way to high school. First, they would confiscate his phone and ID to make sure he couldn’t escape, take pictures or contact anyone. Then, they took him and other boys and young men they’d pulled off the streets to various parts of Tadamon and neighbouring districts, where they put them to work. Mostly, they were forced to fill sandbags at checkpoints or strip electricity cables from destroyed buildings so the copper inside could be sold. But on two occasions, the task was much more extreme. “We were forced to burn bodies,” Ahmed said softly. He paused and looked at his father, who kept his eyes fixed on his son. Ahmed took a slow breath and went on to describe exactly what happened. He was taken to the Othman bin Affan mosque just off Daboul Street, the one that was used as a torture facility. Outside on the street lay the bodies of at least 20 men and women. Many of them carried marks of severe beatings. “Our job,” Ahmed said, “was to take the bodies to the other side of the main street, where there were a lot of demolished buildings and rubble. There we would stack them inside an empty building, close it off, and set the place on fire. By the time I came home, I could smell the burning bodies.” As he listened to his son, Abu Mohammed nodded, as if things were finally falling into place. But when I asked him if he knew, he shook his head. “We would go crazy looking for him on those days,” he said, somewhat apologetically. “We understood something was going on, because he was extremely stressed when he came home, as if he was about to explode. But this is the first time I’ve heard all the details.” Ahmed looked uneasy. “I could not tell anyone,” he replied to his father. “The regime would have hurt us.” Even after escaping to Europe (he asked me not to name the country), he still didn’t dare to talk about his experiences. “People in Europe wouldn’t understand, anyway,” he said. “They helped us a lot, but to them, we are just refugees who fled some kind of war. They don’t know the details of what the regime did to Syrians.” * * * When Assad was toppled on 8 December 2024, Malek Moustafa was on his way home. During his six years of displacement in Idlib, he said, he had spent much time fantasising about taking revenge against the shabiha who ruined his life. Now, the moment had come. “As a victorious man I thought to myself: I will kill the first shabih I see with my bare hands,” Moustafa said. But when he reached Tadamon the day after Assad’s fall, the opposite happened. As he walked through the bombed-out streets of his childhood, he bumped into a former regime fighter. “I first didn’t recognise him, but when I came closer, I saw it was someone who had joined the NDF from the start,” Moustafa said. “Before I could say anything, he said: Welcome, you hero, congratulations on winning the battle!” Moustafa froze for a moment. He knew that Ahmed al-Sharaa, the rebel commander and now Syria’s president, had ordered the rebels not to take revenge against any regime forces who surrendered. As he stood there considering what to do, something happened that he never believed was possible. “He hugged me, and I hugged him back,” the activist said with a smile. “We even kissed on the cheeks. I know it sounds strange, but in that moment, I just felt all the hatred and vengeance go away. I felt peace.” His story is no exception. By all accounts, no blood was shed in Tadamon in the wake of Assad’s fall. Former NDF members simply fled or put down their arms, and some were even seen tearing down Assad portraits. The rebels collected the former regime soldiers’ weapons, but stuck to Sharaa’s orders and refrained from revenge killings – to the surprise of many residents. “We expected them to storm our homes and slaughter us,” one 21-year-old Alawite shopkeeper named Hadi told me. “But that didn’t happen. Many people who used to be with the NDF even stayed in the neighbourhood. Nothing bad happened to them.” Shortly after the liberation, Moustafa and a few activist friends relaunched the work of the Tadamon Coordination Committee, the activist network founded in 2011. The small one-room building in which he received me serves as their office. On the wall hung a large banner with the group’s logo, a clutched fist in the colours of the Syrian revolution flag, today Syria’s official flag. “It hasn’t changed since 2011,” Moustafa said proudly. “I think 90% of our original members have been martyred, but our group has survived.” The activists distribute bread in the neighbourhood, run a Facebook group that is the go-to news source for many residents, and are working on a podcast series on the history and future of Tadamon. They also work closely with the local head of the new general security forces, who is an old friend from the early days of the revolution. When I visited the office, there was a pile of boxes with surveillance cameras lying on the floor which the group was about to install throughout the neighbourhood. “We are building a country now,” Moustafa said. “So we have to think with a government mentality rather than a revolution mentality.” So far, only a handful of people have been arrested for suspected involvement in the mass atrocities in Tadamon, media reports indicate. The local head of the general security forces did not provide me with an exact figure, but acknowledged “it’s a very small number in comparison to the crimes”. Moustafa argued this is understandable in a transitional period. “To achieve justice, we need to first get rid of the chaos,” he said. “These things take time.” But not everyone in Tadamon is so patient. Many residents find the apparent impunity of Assad’s former henchmen hard to stomach. Above all, their anger has become directed against one man: Fadi Saqr. Instead of facing trial for his role as an NDF commander, “the Falcon” has started working with Sharaa’s government. Last February, Saqr visited the neighbourhood under security escort, reportedly to help the government negotiate with other former regime loyalists about handing over weapons. The following day, hundreds of people in Tadamon took to the streets to protest at Saqr’s appearance and hung an effigy of him from a makeshift gallows. A week later, in what seemed an attempt to assuage public outrage, the authorities arrested three men accused of involvement in atrocities in the neighbourhood. Following the anti-Alawite massacres along the Syrian coast last March, the government established a so-called civil peace committee with the stated aim of “strengthening national unity”. Sources familiar with the committee’s activities told me Saqr has helped the government to disarm former regime affiliates, secured the release of government security personnel taken hostage along the Syrian coast, and used his contacts with former regime figures to strike deals on behalf of the new government. Last June, it was reported that Saqr was involved in the release of previously detained former regime officers. In response to the public outrage that followed, the government gave a press conference in which Hassan Soufan, a member of the civil peace committee, said the released officers did not commit violations against civilians and defended the committee’s collaboration with Saqr. “We understand the anger and the pain felt by the families of the martyrs and victims,” Soufan told reporters. “But in this phase of civil peace, we are sometimes forced to make decisions to avoid more violent explosions and to secure relative stability necessary for the coming stage.” Soufan hinted that the former NDF commander contributed to the liberation of Damascus by coordinating with Sharaa’s forces and he emphasised Saqr’s importance to “untangling knots, solving problems and facing dangers that the country is exposed to”. At the moment, Soufan indicated, there are no plans to prosecute Saqr or revoke his security protection. In a statement to the New York Times straight after the press conference, Saqr himself denied responsibility for the Tadamon massacre, claiming he was appointed to lead the NDF only after the massacre seen in the April 2013 video. “If the ministry of interior had any evidence against me, I wouldn’t be working with them today,” he said. (The ministry of interior has been contacted for comment.) In Tadamon, the press conference and Saqr’s statement have only stoked public anger. “Whenever Fadi Saqr makes an appearance, it ignites this neighbourhood,” the local general security chief Abu Abdelrahman told me in his office last August. Though he made sure not to overtly criticise the government’s dealings with the former NDF boss, he also said that even if he was formally appointed to lead the militia after the April 2013 killings, “massacres happened after Fadi Saqr took charge”. After the relative calm in the wake of Assad’s fall, the security situation in Tadamon has deteriorated since Saqr made an appearance, Abdelrahman said. A few weeks after the press conference, a man accused of having worked as Saqr’s bodyguard was shot dead in the street, and several revenge killings against suspected former NDF members have followed. “We are in a hurry and are applying pressure on the government to punish the criminals,” he said. The longer the impunity lasts, he warned, the more difficult it becomes for him to dissuade locals from taking revenge. “Is it really natural for a person who sees his brother’s killer or sister’s rapist right in front of him not to act? He might be patient once, twice, multiple times. But in the end, he will act.” * * * Today in Tadamon, there are simmering conflicts between neighbours that may still erupt into violence. In a dead end street close to Abu Mohammed’s house, I met one elderly couple who told me about their apprehensions. When the war started, they said, their four sons joined the NDF “out of fear”, but they were all killed by the regime’s own forces after conflicts with their superiors. “Now we have to take care of our grandchildren,” the woman said, as some of the young children ran around the living room. With Assad gone, the family has been receiving threats. On one occasion, a group of men stormed into the home and tore the portraits of the sons from the wall. “After that I burned all of my son’s portraits,” said the old woman, as she started to sob. “People used to be so nice to me. Before 8 December my neighbours kissed me on my forehead when they saw me. They called me the mother of the martyrs. But after 8 December, nobody talks to me.” I told Abu Mohammed about my encounter with the woman. “The tears of a whore,” he said, bitterly. According to him and several other residents I interviewed, the old woman used to denounce her neighbours to the authorities and plundered the homes of those who got arrested or fled. “I would see her with a cart full of furniture when I left home in the morning,” said Abu Mohammed. “The family even ran a shop where they sold the booty. Nobody dared to ask where they got it from.” What will happen to this family now? Abu Mohammed showed me a Facebook post by a friend who lost his relatives in the massacres. “Why are they still in the neighbourhood?” the man had written. “Why are the security forces protecting them? If our martyrs are not considered part of the revolution […] we must act.” To leave no doubt as to what his aim is, the man included the family’s full address in his post. “People have vengeance in their hearts,” Abu Mohammed said as he put down his phone. “I personally still trust that President Sharaa will bring us justice, because he is one of us. But if he doesn’t, I’m sure that the men in the neighbourhood will take care of this.” • Listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

Not only do they talk about it, they go out and measure it. A new paper in the journal Weather celebrates some of the UK’s most prolific and dedicated rainfall observers. Richard Towneley started the trend in 1677, taking regular measurements of the amount of rain that fell at Towneley Hall near Burnley. By 1860, George Symons had started to coordinate the collection of rainfall data and set up the British Rainfall Organisation, gathering data from several hundred rain gauges across the nation. Many observers diligently collected observations for 50 years or more, while others, such as Clement Lindley Wragge, went to great lengths to gather their data. Wragge walked a 22km (14-mile) round trip every day between June and October of 1881 to retrieve data from the weather station at the top of the UK’s highest peak, Ben Nevis. This dedication continues to the present day. Tom Bown began daily observations aged 10 in 1948 and has amassed over 75 years of rainfall data from his family farm on Anglesey, even receiving an MBE for his work. This rich data is invaluable for improving weather forecasts and climate models. However, researchers are concerned that the enthusiasm for gathering rainfall data is waning, with more data now available for the 1880s than the most recent decade."

news_2025_nov_15_hurricane-melissa-a-real-time-case-study-of-colonialisms-legacies.txt,news,2025-11-15,Natricia Duncan in Kingston,Hurricane Melissa a ‘real-time case study’ of colonialism’s legacies,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/15/hurricane-melissa-a-real-time-case-study-of-colonialisms-legacies,"Perched on the edge of a hill in the idyllic village of Cold Spring in Hanover, Jamaica, the Gurney’s Mount Baptist church has stood for centuries as a symbol of resistance and endurance. The church and its congregation have endured through uprisings – in particular the famous 1831 slave revolt led by the Black Baptist deacon Samuel Sharpe – and earthquakes. But when Hurricane Melissa descended on Jamaica, it ripped off the church roof and shredded the rows of sturdy pews, leaving an unrecognisable mangle of wood and debris in its wake. Outside, parts of the structure had survived the onslaught of the category 5 storm. The church is one of Jamaica’s 146,000 buildings – just 15% of those assessed so far – that has suffered major to severe damage, according to Alvin Gayle, director general of Jamaica’s emergency management office. The death toll on Thursday was 45, with 13 people missing; an estimated 90,000 households and 360,000 people have been affected by the damage. The names of past members are still etched into its walls and the “freedom stone”, built into its structure to commemorate the end of slavery on 1 August 1838, is still there. As church and faith groups play a significant role in Jamaica’s recovery, the loss of the building and parts of the adjacent school are a huge blow to the community, Rev O’Neil Bowen told the Guardian. Cold Spring village, and many of its neighbouring communities in Hanover, where residents are still coming to terms with catastrophic destruction, were once plantations owned by Europeans who amassed wealth from centuries of trafficking and enslavement of African people. One of the Guardian’s 19th-century funders co-owned a plantation, Success, in the area. For the last few years, the Legacies of Enslavement Programme has been engaging with these communities to discuss priorities for repair. At the ongoing UN Cop30 climate change conference in Brazil, campaigners say that devastated regions such as Hanover as well as others across Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti, are stark examples of how African descendants are disproportionately affected by centuries of environmental degradation. Speaking from Cop30, Jamaican economist Mariama Williams said historical injustices must be confronted and addressed. “The research shows that wherever Afro descendants are located, they are most vulnerable to climate and environmental impact and have been suffering from historical environmental injustice and climate injustice,” she said. “Climate justice cannot be separated from reparatory justice. The same systems that enriched the north created today’s vulnerabilities.” The Global Afrodescendant Climate Justice Collaborative, where Williams is a senior adviser, is among hundreds of human rights groups and environmentalists that urged Cop30 to put reparations on the agenda. In their open letter they argue that “global warming began with the Industrial Revolutions that were made possible by the resources provided by imperialism, colonialism and enslavement, [and] that colonialism and enslavement skewed the global economy in favour of the material and financial interests in the global north”. Describing the efforts to recover from Hurricane Melissa as a “real-time case study” that validated this argument, Williams said: “The storm hit rural Jamaica hardest – people who are poorest, least protected, and historically marginalised. The same communities shaped by slavery, colonial extraction, and racialised policies are now on the frontline of climate disaster. So we’re not in theory any more.” The economist believes countries such as Jamaica should have remedies such as being able to identify and write off debts which they were forced into because of their colonial past. Outlining the magnitude of the challenge facing Jamaica, the prime minister, Andrew Holness, estimated the damage caused by Melissa to be about $6bn-$7bn (£4.6bn-£5.3bn) based on preliminary figures. Aid has been pouring into the country and the World Bank announced last week that the government of Jamaica would receive a full payout of $150m under its catastrophe insurance coverage. But for environmental justice academic and associate professor Kevon Rhiney, though insurance payouts are important, Caribbean countries need more sustainable solutions in order to withstand the brunt of climate change they did not cause. “Countries cannot just be expected to insure their risks because the fact that a single hurricane can wipe out an entire agricultural sector means that these bonds will not be enough to cover the full risk and the loss and damages that these countries will accrue.” he said. Referring to the amount of money pledged to the UN-backed loss and damage fund to help vulnerable countries recover from climate change impacts such as extreme weather, as “embarrassingly low”, he called for a greater commitment from high-emitting countries. “We’re not begging these countries. This is a debt that is owed. And I think this needs to be made clear. And this is why there is very deep connection between calls for climate reparations and reparations for slavery, because they’re both connected through these longer histories, these colonial legacies,” he said. The UK has pledged £7.5m. Arley Gill, a member of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) Reparations Commission, set up to advance the region’s pursuit of reparatory justice, told the Guardian that “a successful Cop cannot avoid a discussion about climate change and reparations”. “Hurricane Melissa once again showed us that the same islands and the same peoples that are … demanding reparative justice for the crimes against humanity of slavery, slave trade, and indigenous genocide, are the same peoples and the same countries that are on the wrong end of the effect of climate change. And so those two issues are inseparable. “We call upon the global leaders, to once and for all to confront the harsh reality of that climate change is as a direct result of the impact of colonialism and industrial revolution which was fuelled by the crimes against humanity.” he said. On Thursday, the UN permanent forum on people of African descent called for climate action rooted in human rights, and reparatory and racial justice. “We must recognise that climate justice cannot succeed without addressing historical and structural forms of injustice and their lasting consequences.”"

The Commonwealth Bank’s chief executive, Mat Comyn, mounted a fierce defence of charging fees according to its terms and conditions during a parliamentary committee hearing in Canberra on Tuesday morning, Australian Securities and Investments Commission in July found that CBA – which reported a record cash profit of $10.3bn in the most recent financial year – and its subsidiary Bankwest charged about $270m fees to about 2.2 million low-income customers over five years. Those fees included account-keeping, dishonour and overdraw charges. Sign up: AU Breaking News email While other banks, such as Westpac, have committed to fully repay what the regulator deemed “excessive fees”, Comyn was defiant. “If I was you … I’d be looking at me and thinking, ‘Well you work for a financial institution, your institution makes lots of money, why don’t you just give that money back?’,” he said to Labor MP Ed Husic. “I can certainly understand that.” But he disputed Asic’s description that “every dollar” of the charges were “excessive”. “They were charged in accordance with the terms and conditions. (There was) nothing improper about those charges.” Comyn, who is one of the most influential business executives in the country, continued: “It’s not merely a question of just handing the money over. It’s, of course, not my or our money. It’s the money of our owners. “And I think perhaps there’s a sort of harsher interpretation of how a shareholder may think of that, which is, well, it’s effectively appropriation of their property.” The head of policy at Choice, Morgan Campbell, said Comyn had “got it backwards”. “Before this money was in the pockets of Commbank shareholders, it was in the bank accounts of Australians on low incomes and it should never have been taken out,” Campbell said. “His shareholders should never have had it in the first place. “The other banks issued bulk refunds to at least some of their customers months ago. It’s time for Commbank to stop making excuses and put this right.” While Comyn insisted the fees identified by Asic were not “unlawful”, there was some scope to make payments to some as a “goodwill” gesture. Meanwhile, Westpac’s CEO, Anthony Miller, told the parliamentary committee that his bank was fully refunding nearly $10m in fees charged to low-income customers. “We have agreed to refund those fees,” Miller said. “We are now proceeding through the cohort identified (by Asic) in July 2024.” The Westpac boss confirmed that the bank would automatically migrate current and future eligible customers into these special low-fee accounts, and that people would need to opt out. Miller said the full amount would be refunded by March next year."

news_2025_nov_19_an-existential-battle-of-interests-what-the-sudanese-war-is-actually-about.txt,news,2025-11-19,Nesrine Malik,An existential battle of interests: what the Sudanese war is actually about,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/19/an-existential-battle-of-interests-what-the-sudanese-war-is-actually-about,"Almost everywhere I go, I am asked about Sudan. The questions are partly from concern for family and my birth country, and partly from a genuine desire to understand how the conflict there has turned into something so intense and seemingly unstoppable. This week, I break down what is happening in the country, and why it has escalated to catastrophic proportions. *** A sense of incredulity The first answer I give when asked about my thoughts on the war is always the same: I still can’t believe it is happening. Three years into the conflict, there is still a sense of incredulity that Sudan has unravelled so quickly. This is probably how it always feels to those whose countries have suddenly succumbed to war. To outsiders, war remains a story, a headline, a political event, and perhaps, particularly in Africa, not a remote or unexpected occurrence. But it is no one’s natural lot, and every day is as hard and bewildering as the one before. *** Two histories of war There are two histories to the war in Sudan. One long, and one short. The long history is of a country where political and economic power has always been in the hands of the few. Regions such as Darfur have historically been marginalised and ignored. The region has suffered competition for resources and conflict along ethnic lines between Arab and African groups for decades, and a genocide against its non-Arab population was perpetrated in the early 2000s by Arab militias known as the Janjaweed, with the blessing and support of central government. The result was that, even as Sudan as a whole never fell apart, intense localised conflicts rumbled on for decades, leading to the growth and empowerment of militarised groups. The most concrete legacy of that history is the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a militia that was formalised out of armed groups and is now at war with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). *** A sabotaged revolution The short history has its roots in Sudan’s popular revolution of 2019, in which president Omar al-Bashir who ruled Sudan for almost 30 years was deposed after months of protest. It was a revolution that had two demands: first the removal of a dictator, and second the ejection of the military (from whose ranks Bashir came when he led a coup in 1989) from power once and for all. In the aftermath of the revolution, it became clear that the RSF, which had partnered with Bashir and his government to suppress rebellion in Darfur, had amassed significant power. With Bashir gone, the RSF and the SAF entered what was supposed to be a transitional power-sharing agreement with civilians in order to pave the way for civilian rule. It was short-lived. The SAF and RSF turned on the civilians, and then each other. Sudan, it turned out, was only big enough for one armed body. *** What the war is – and what it isn’t Sudan’s conflict is often described as a “civil war”. But there is no civilian feature to this war. They did not take up arms against one another, and their lives and livelihoods have been the price of the power struggle between the two parties. The war is also spoken of as the “forgotten war”, but that glosses over the fact that the duration, intensity, and reporting of the conflict leave little room for doubt that it is anything other than a war that just isn’t proportionally cared about. The war is not forgotten; it is ignored and sometimes tolerated. The UN’s humanitarian response plan for Sudan remains chronically underfunded. The Trump administration has gutted humanitarian aid, hitting Sudan particularly hard, and scaled back the entire Africa engagement effort. All the while, valiant accountability and reporting efforts continue, as do dogged campaigns to raise awareness and funds on the part of Sudanese at home and in the diaspora. You will also hear of Sudan’s conflict as a “proxy war”, which gives the sense that outside forces are lining up equally behind all parties. Several actors have been drawn in, but the main outside influence in this war is the United Arab Emirates, which has pumped funds and arms into the hands of the RSF while denying any involvement. To the UAE, securing influence in Sudan, a strategically located, gold-rich and fertile country, would significantly expand the Emirates’ political and economic power. What the war actually is: an existential battle between the old guard; the Sudanese army and the associated parties and interests it represents, and a new militia that amassed staggering influence and support outside the official auspices of the state, and now seeks to claim it. *** The violent, heartbreaking toll It is difficult to know where to start. Again, statistics about the millions of displaced, hundreds of thousands estimated to have been killed, sexual violence, and humanitarian catastrophe and hunger still cannot capture the individual tragedies or their reverberations. The loss of home and loved ones resonates with my own family story. Our house in Khartoum was taken over by the RSF, looted, and then left gutted, deep holes dug in the ground and walls to extract even the pipes and wires. There are the millions of elderly people scattered around Sudan and the wider region, who now live their last days wrenched and in painful impoverished exile. And there is the systematic massacre by the RSF of the African population in Darfur, re-opening the wounds of the earlier genocide. The largest SAF Darfur stronghold city of El Fasher, fell last month to the RSF after a year and a half of brutal siege, and the reports of summary executions that have soaked the land in blood continue to emerge. With El Fasher’s takeover, the RSF consolidated its hold over the west of the country, leaving Sudan essentially divided into two, with the rest under the control of the SAF. Neither party seems to have the capacity to decisively overwhelm the other, and few western powers seem to have the appetite to decisively intervene to put pressure either on sponsors like the UAE, or apply leverage on to either belligerent party. *** The uncertain future Another strange psychological feature of war is the inability to conceive of a future other than the one that looks like the past. There is still a part of me that believes in an unrealistic return of the genie back in the bottle, a homecoming for all where we can pick up the pieces and somehow reconcile the country. But I know, and refuse to know, that this is not a likely scenario. In the meantime there is only hope that this cannot continue forever, and that the more the world learns about Sudan, the more its war becomes not just a lamenting headline, but a matter of intolerable urgency. • To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday, please subscribe here."

The US president had spent much of this year trying to bat away questions about Epstein while rejecting pressure to release the bulk of the files. But in an abrupt reversal on Sunday – widely seen as an admission that he cannot control his Maga base on the issue – Trump urged House Republicans to back the release of the files after all. That was duly passed this week and if the Senate also votes the same way, the justice department will be compelled to release all unclassified materials on Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. So we may soon find out what Trump has tried for so long to keep buried. As David Smith writes for our big story, last week’s email release pointed less to a grand conspiracy and more to an elite world in which wealthy, powerful and privileged individuals operate above the law. One thing’s for sure: despite Trump’s wishes, the Epstein scandal isn’t going away just yet.

news_2025_nov_20_weatherwatch-easterly-winds-clear-skies-waxwings-bird-migration.txt,news,2025-11-20,Stephen Moss,Easterly winds and clear skies are cue for charismatic waxwings to cross to UK,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/20/weatherwatch-easterly-winds-clear-skies-waxwings-bird-migration,"By November in the UK, autumn bird migration is more or less over. Our summer visitors, such as warblers, chats and flycatchers, are far to the south in Africa. Meanwhile, many winter visitors – mostly waders and wildfowl – have arrived from their breeding grounds to the north and east. Nevertheless, as the British Trust for Ornithology’s regular Migration Blog reports, there are still plenty of birds on the move, with specific weather conditions either holding them back or boosting their travels. Waxwings are a much sought-after arrival, and this autumn looks good with high numbers in southern Scandinavia. Should we get easterly winds and clear skies, these charismatic birds could cross the North Sea and turn up along our east coast, often gathering in noisy flocks in supermarket car parks where they feast on berries. Woodcocks also travel here from Scandinavia on clear nights, their numbers peaking in November. However, these secretive, woodland-dwelling waders are far harder to see. The BTO’s experts also suggest we look out for movements of wood pigeons – not a species we usually associate with migration, yet which often move in large flocks. Late last month an astonishing 231,000 wood pigeons were observed heading south-west over the village of Portskewett in Gwent. It is thought that at least some of these birds will cross the Channel to overwinter in continental Europe before returning next spring to breed."

The then German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, gave a passionate speech about how greenhouse gases must be reduced to save the planet from overheating. There was a relatively unknown East German woman, the environment minister, Angela Merkel, chairing the conference. She was red hot at keeping order. The UK journalists concluded she would have a bright future. Immediately after the conference I was commissioned to write a book about climate change called Global Warming: Can Civilization Survive? It sold well and was the first of several. Scroll forward through Kyoto, Paris and the annual ritual of 30 years of Cops and the same speech Kohl made has been repeated, sometimes almost word for word, by prime ministers, presidents and campaigners year after year. As I write, the carbon level – recorded daily in this paper – has reached 426.68 parts per million – well over scientists’ so called “safe” limit of 350. According to them, the planet is heading towards oblivion. All that time news editors have told me not to be too downbeat; let’s have some optimism. This is my last column.

In this week’s newsletter we have charts on … revenue sharing in the WNBA, how close we are to meeting global climate targets, elections in eastern India, how spinner Nathan Lyon eclipses everyone else, how the media covers transgender people, and a bonus cricket quiz. But first … the climate crisis is expensive! In Australia, some politicians have been making claims that achieving the target of net zero emissions by 2050 will cost too much. However, looking only at the cost of the transition to net zero ignores how much it will cost the Australian economy if we – and the world – don’t make the changes required to meaningfully address climate change. That is to say, how does the cost of net zero compare with the cost of a scenario where we don’t take any more action on climate change, or delay the net zero transition? This chart shows that if climate change were not sufficiently addressed, Australia’s GDP would be 9% lower than it would otherwise be in 2050. This would amount to a difference of several hundred billion dollars: You can read more about this here, and also check out an experimental animated and sonified version of the chart here. Our colleagues have also done some excellent work examining the numbers on other claims, including how net zero will affect power bills, whether Australians are really paying more for electricity than other countries, and factchecking various other claims. Four charts from the fortnight *** 1. It’s Ashes Friday! The most important time of year is upon us – the Australian summer of cricket. And to make it extra special it’s an Ashes year (for non-cricket lovers, the English team has come to Australia to get roundly thrashed play five test matches). A lot of the talk in the lead-up to the series has been about fast bowling. But we loved this scatterplot comparing spinners in Ben Wylie’s Plot The Ball newsletter: Really hadn’t appreciated what a workhorse Australian spinner Nathan Lyon has been. Or the gulf between him and Shoaib Bashir, England’s top off-spinner. We have relaunched our cricket position quiz for the Ashes – are you in the 10% of readers who know where Extra Cover stands? Take our test. Our colleagues from the UK and Australia have also worked out the top 100 Ashes players of all time – perfect fodder for some holiday arguments. *** 2. Where in the world Narenda Modi’s BJP won a thumping victory in recent state elections in Bihar, a relatively poor and populous state in eastern India. Just ahead of the poll The Hindu published this fantastic map diving into the demographics, geography, culture, challenges and electoral history of different parts of Bihar: Speaking of election maps, here’s a super slick one from the New York Times about their recent mayoral election. *** 3. What a Cop out The Cop30 climate summit has been under way in Brazil (and you can read all the Guardian’s coverage here), which means there has been a deluge of charts relating to emissions and global heating. While there are some “good news” charts (more on these below), it’s important to show that the current trajectory for carbon emissions is still well above where it should be. This chart, from Glen Peters, plots recent global emissions (in black) against the emissions in modelled scenarios that keep global warming below 1.5C (in blue): Elsewhere, the NYT plots the latest data from the Global Carbon Project, showing that “emissions are on track to soar to record highs in 2025”. There is, however, some good news, with data showing China’s CO2 emissions have been flat or falling for the past 18 months, and the Global Carbon Project has a nice chart showing that 35 countries have managed to cut emissions while still growing their economies. The Guardian and ProPublica have also published an analysis of how Trump’s expansion of fossil fuels and cutting of emission reduction efforts will result in an additional 1.3m temperature-related deaths over 80 years. *** 4. A cluster of clusters This one is an interactive in two parts. A beautiful streamgraph showing the number of articles about trans communities over time: But perhaps even more impressive, when you click through the articles are clustered by topic – and you can click through to the actual stories. This was a collaboration between legendary data visualiser Alberto Cairo, the University of Miami, the Trans Journalists Association and Polygraph (the studio behind perennial Crunch-favourites The Pudding).

Cop30, which concluded last Saturday in Belém, Brazil, was little different from its recent predecessors, despite the growing urgency of needing to find a solution to our ever hotter planet. For this week’s big story, environment editor Fiona Harvey details how weak consensus was forged between states on the frontline of climate change and the petrostates that sought a rollback from the need to “transition away from fossil” fuels agreed two years ago in Dubai. And Jonathan Watts pinpoints the geopolitical headwinds that made this Cop especially difficult, although there is cause for some celebration over the flawed deal. In the face of a US president wedded to oil and coal who pursues idiosyncratic policy goals, the growth of rightwing populism, conflict in Ukraine and Gaza and worldwide economic uncertainty, it was unlikely Cop30 could have made a major step forward. But it did show that international co-operation remains an effective and necessary tool.

news_2025_nov_26_ignoring-minorities-is-our-original-sin-the-complex-roots-of-nigerias-security-crisis.txt,news,2025-11-26,Jason Okundaye,‘Ignoring minorities is our original sin’: the complex roots of Nigeria’s security crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/26/ignoring-minorities-is-our-original-sin-the-complex-roots-of-nigerias-security-crisis,"“If they explain Nigeria to you and you understand it, they didn’t explain it well enough”. So goes the maxim for trying to parse Nigeria’s labyrinthine political dynamics. A security crisis has engulfed the country, catching the attention of the US president in the process. With the help of our West Africa correspondent, Eromo Egbejule, I’ll try to get to the bottom of what is happening. The marginalisation of Nigeria’s minorities On Friday, more than 300 schoolchildren were kidnapped from a Catholic school in the country’s north-central Niger State. That was just the latest example of escalating violence, as the country has been plagued by crises including the killings of hundreds in Benue State and a recent live-streamed terrorist attack on worshippers at a church in Kwara State. Earlier this month, Donald Trump threatened to invade, citing an ongoing ‘‘Christian genocide”, while Trinidadian hip-hop star Nicki Minaj spoke at a UN event in New York spotlighting Christian persecution. After Minaj’s address at the UN, Rolling Stone published an article claiming that “Nicki’s claims of extremism against Nigerian Christians … aren’t backed by any data.” The article has not been received well by many Nigerians online, who have argued that westerners are weighing in with unwarranted authority. “To start, there is religious persecution in Nigeria,” Eromo says. “The dominant Islamic class, entrenched by the 18th-century Fulani scholar Usman dan Fodio, proposed a much stricter version of Islam, which is what influenced the implementation of Sharia Law in 12 states after Nigeria returned to democracy, from 1999 to the early 2000s. And so some of those who haven’t adhered to that have been killed and displaced.” This not only affects Christians – Muslim groups are also impacted if they are not seen as Muslim proper. In the north there are Sunni groups attacking Shia groups, who are viewed as heretics by extremists such as Boko Haram. The country’s middle belt, a site of much of this violence, has “a predominance of minorities”. “Many Nigerian crises are essentially about the marginalisation of political, ethnic and religious minorities. Such minorities feel whatever little resources they have left are being taken away by the majority or state-backed minorities,” Eromo says. “It’s just that the most colourful manifestation of this marginalisation is between Christians and Muslims, and most minorities in the middle belt are Christian.” While there are significant Muslim casualties, this does not undermine the reality of religious persecution against Christians in Nigerian states such as Benue and Kaduna; but it should be seen as one aspect in a broader quagmire of domination. *** The herder-farmer conflict Nigeria’s security crisis differs significantly by region. The most notable thus far has been Boko Haram’s insurgency in the north-east, but it is the herder-farmer conflict, which has been especially prominent in the middle belt, that has largely been extrapolated into a narrative of “Christian genocide”. There is little cattle ranching in Nigeria, due to a resistance in uptake of ranches and the prevalence of nomadic cattle herds. The Fulani herdsmen historically had a more symbiotic relationship with non-Fulani farmers, but this has become strained by resource competition and exploitation by criminal groups. Climate change, desertification and deforestation have all exacerbated the problem, as Fulani herdsmen travel farther south. And there is the rapid development of former herding trails. “Abuja used to be part of the big grazing roads in the 1960s, but now it is the capital, there’s malls and complexes where you used to take your cows through.” What this has left is a series of grievances and conflicts, and with a lack of functioning state policing to calm the problems, the result is large graveyards. These herdsmen and militias also have access to more complicated and sophisticated weaponry, with conflicts in the Sahel region fuelling the proliferation of unsecured weapon stockpiles. This has led to an asymmetric conflict with Christian farmers, who often only have machetes. *** A centralised power with little federal oversight Eromo says that Nigeria has repeatedly failed to get to grips with insurgent violence because of a centralised government. “Abuja has all of the power, and there’s a lot of ungoverned, or under governed, spaces.” He also points to the lack of state police. He says that “Nigeria’s big problem” is “ignoring the minorities and focusing on regime security. It’s Nigeria’s original sin.” Eromo continues: “Intelligence sharing is terrible. And so in all of these forests across the middle belt, north-east and into the north-west, there’s space for non-state actors to take over and to plan.” Indeed it was in Sambisa forest that the kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls were held by Boko Haram. “So you have ideological criminals who are persecuting the religious, political and ethnic minorities. Then you have commercial criminals looking for money. There’s just so many groups – which is why the catch-all term is ‘bandits’.” The problem is also obfuscated by non-herder Fulani-speaking criminals exploiting resource conflicts and stereotypes. *** ‘Data is a luxury in Nigeria’ There are significant blind spots in the country’s data collection, hence calls for a unified national database. “Data is a luxury in Nigeria,” Eromo says. “There’s never enough data, no one even truly knows the true size of the economy, it’s just inshallah and vibes. Nigeria is so big, there’s forests where there’s no network, so sometimes you hear of atrocities 10 days later when a person escapes. Nigeria doesn’t even know how many people it has, we see an estimated 220 million, it could be less, it could be more. It’s been a problem spanning more than 100 years, since the first British census of Nigeria in 1921.” So the real extent of the persecution is not clear. “What if the people on the ground are seeing things that the rest of us don’t see?” Eromo says. “We have to tread carefully.” Religious persecution also cannot always be neatly divided from other motives. For example, Eromo tells me that the targeted abduction of Nigerian priests amounts to religious persecution. But priests are “economically important in small communities” and attract a higher ransom from church attendants as well as the Christian diaspora. “Some Imams have also been targeted, but people are more likely to pay for a priest.” *** Where now for Nigeria? There is no singular resolution for a country whose problems are too intricate and myriad to ever be done justice in this analysis. Is American intervention the answer? Certainly not. But I am loth to criticise the Nigerians who have echoed calls for US intervention. At the very least, perhaps such international embarrassment might wake up the Nigerian government. The narrative might be isolated from nuance, but that is understandably not the concern of victims and survivors. Why would Nigeria’s ignored minorities not embrace a moment of global attention? • To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday, please subscribe here."

news_2025_nov_27_hong-kong-apartment-complex-fire-reaction.txt,news,2025-11-27,Helen Davidson in Hong Kong,"In air thick with acrid smoke, people in Hong Kong are reeling and angry",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/27/hong-kong-apartment-complex-fire-reaction,"More than 24 hours after the first tower caught fire, the Hong Kong residential complex was still burning. Fire crews blasted water from cherrypickers at the mid-level floors, but above that, the fires were roaring out of reach. Wang Fuk Court, in the northern Hong Kong district of Tai Po, was home to about 4,800 people. The eight-tower complex had been under renovation for years, clad in bamboo scaffolding and mesh. On Wednesday afternoon, for reasons that are under investigation, one of them caught fire. The blaze spread inside the building, and then across to neighbouring towers. By evening, seven buildings were ablaze, and the death toll had already surpassed Hong Kong’s previous worst ever building fire disaster. At least 65 people have been killed, including one firefighter, and dozens injured. At least 55 were rescued but more than 250 are missing. Firefighters were still unable to reach the top levels of some of the 31-storey towers, although one elderly man was rescued alive from his high up apartment earlier in the day. The air was still filled with acrid smoke, which reminded some of how the city smelled during the worst violence of the 2019 protests. A brief panic broke out when a flickering light in the window of a different block was mistaken for another fire, and onlookers exchanged nervous looks when the breeze picked up: Wednesday’s fire was fanned by a stiff winter northerly, said James Tang, who lives in one of the towers. Tang was not home when the building caught fire. He received a call from his brother-in-law who saw it from across the river. He rushed home but was stopped from entering. “I watched from the outside as the building burned,” he said, speaking to the Guardian outside a local primary school, which is one of the shelters for evacuated residents. Tang’s friends in the complex were not among the missing, he said. “But a lot of people died, especially the fireman. We are very sorry about this. The fireman tried to save us from the fire, tried to stop the fire and then he lost his life.” Nearby, volunteers had set up a market of donated clothes, food and essentials for the now homeless residents of Wang Fuk Court and the hundreds of others temporarily evacuated from neighbouring buildings. Connie Chu had just returned home from grocery shopping to the apartment she had lived in for 42 years when she saw a mass of fire trucks. A neighbour told her to leave, even though none of them had heard a fire alarm. “There should have been [an alarm],” she said. “When I came out I saw one building on fire, it was a horrible, huge fire. We were so worried.” Chu and her neighbours were lucky – their building was the only one of the complex’s eight not to burn. “I have a friend who lives in one of the other buildings and she’s in hospital. It seems quite serious. I spoke to her on the phone yesterday, she said a lot of smoke had entered her home.” The community is reeling, and some are angry: police suspect the fire was caused by “grossly negligent” action. Hong Kong police have alleged unsafe scaffolding and foam materials used during maintenance work may have been behind the rapid spread of the fire, and three people from the related construction company have been arrested. The Independent Commission Against Corruption has already announced a taskforce. There have been long-running complaints about the renovation, including allegations the alarms were switched off months ago by construction workers, and that workers smoked on site. There have also been broader concerns about the safety standards for the mesh used on sites. A video being widely shared on Thursday shows a local council member setting fire to a piece of green construction mesh and watching it quickly melt and burn. By nightfall on Thursday, the surrounding area was still filled with people – emergency services, onlookers, neighbours, victims and their families. Outside a building where the deceased were being identified, people left sobbing, clutching at each other. Some wore blankets over their heads to avoid the cameras. Pastor Samson Wong, from the Cumberland Presbyterian church, was waiting with a crowd of volunteers to give emotional and psychological support to the families who have lost people. “They have enough material supplies, but they need emotional support,” he said."

Firefighters were still battling to reach people who could be trapped on the upper floors of the Wang Fuk Court housing complex on Thursday due to the intense heat and thick smoke generated by the fire. Late in the day, a survivor was rescued from a stairway on the 16th floor of one of the towers, the South China Morning Post reported. Early on Friday, authorities said the death toll had reached 94. Officials have also reported 76 people injured, including 11 firefighters. It is the deadliest Hong Kong fire in decades. Fire service officials said blazes in four of the eight apartment blocks in the estate had been extinguished and that three fires were under control. One building was not affected. Hong Kong’s chief executive, John Lee, said in the early hours of Thursday that 279 people were unaccounted for, though firefighters said later that they had established contact with some of those people. Authorities have not updated the figure since. Lee said more than 900 people had sought refuge at temporary shelters overnight. Eileen Chung, a Hong Kong police superintendent, alleged: “We have reason to believe that the company’s responsible parties were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties.” Three men from the construction company, two directors and one engineering consultant had been arrested, Chung added, without giving further details. Chung did not name the company but police later on Thursday searched the office of Prestige Construction and Engineering Company. Officers seized boxes of documents as evidence, according to local media. The government separately identified the registered contractor for the building complex as Prestige. Noting the requirement for use of fire-retardant netting and screens on scaffolding, it said in a statement: “If any violations of the requirements of the buildings ordinance are found, the case will be referred to the BD [buildings department] for handling in accordance with the ordinance, including prosecution or disciplinary proceedings.” Prestige has not yet publicly commented. The Tai Po district includes eight 31-storey towers containing about 2,000 flats, which house about 4,800 people. The site was undergoing renovation work at the time. Police alleged the buildings had been covered with protective mesh sheets and plastic that may not have met fire standards, and discovered some windows on one unaffected building were sealed with a foam material, installed by a construction company carrying out maintenance work. The fire is thought to have spread on bamboo scaffolding around the building, and was probably aided by windy conditions. Bamboo scaffolding is a ubiquitous sight across Hong Kong building sites, though the government has said it is being phased out for safety reasons. The fire has prompted comparisons with the Grenfell Tower inferno that killed 72 people in London in 2017. That fire was blamed on firms fitting the exterior with flammable cladding, as well as failings by the government and the construction industry. Three companies that were heavily criticised in the findings of the Grenfell inquiry last year have all continued to deny wrongdoing. The Tai Po district authorities have opened shelters in community halls, at least one of which local media reported was full by Wednesday night, and police have set up a casualty hotline. Several forums and campaign events related to 7 December elections that had been scheduled for the coming days have been cancelled. On Wednesday night, dozens of shocked residents, many sobbing, watched from pavements as smoke funnelled up from the complex. One 71-year-old resident surnamed Wong broke down in tears, saying his wife was trapped inside. Another longtime resident, a woman surnamed Chu, said she still had not been able to contact her friends who live in the next block. After staying at a friend’s place on Wednesday night, the 70-year-old came back to see her home still burning. “We don’t know what to do,” she said. Harry Cheung, 66, who has lived at Block 2 in one of the complexes for more than 40 years, said he heard a loud noise about 2.45pm (0645 GMT) and saw fire erupt in a nearby block. “I don’t even know how I feel right now,” he said. “I’m just thinking about where I’m going to sleep tonight because I probably won’t be able to go back home.” China’s leader, Xi Jinping, urged an “all-out effort” to extinguish the fire and to minimise casualties and losses, as residents voiced anger online at possible causes of the fire. One video appeared to show several construction workers smoking on the bamboo scaffolding surrounding one of the complex’s blocks during the renovation process. Building standards in Hong Kong are relatively high and vastly improved in recent decades, but the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, a local advocacy group, expressed deep concern about fires associated with scaffolding, noting similar incidents in April, May and October. Though fire hazard was not cited as a reason for the phasing-out of bamboo scaffolding, there have been at least three fires involving bamboo scaffolding this year, according to the association. Wang Fuk Court is one of many high-rise housing complexes in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Tai Po, located near the border with mainland China, is an established suburban district with about 300,000 residents. Occupied since 1983, the complex is under the government’s subsidised home ownership scheme, according to property agency websites. According to online posts, it has been undergoing renovations for a year at a cost of HK$330m ($42.4m), with each unit paying between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000. Reuters contributed to this report"

At least 76 people are injured, including 11 firefighters, and around 250 people are missing. Hong Kong’s chief executive John Lee said fires have been brought under control across the seven of eight towers. The complex is made up of eight 32-storey towers, containing about 2,000 flats, and were being renovated at the time. About 4,800 people live there. Three men aged between 52 and 68 were arrested on Thursday morning on suspicion of manslaughter. The trio – two directors and one engineering consultant – worked at a construction company, police said. Police alleged they had reason to believe the company’s responsible parties were “grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties”. Police did not name the company but later on Thursday searched the office of a construction and engineering company. They seized boxes of documents as evidence, according to local media. Firefighters and rescue crews started searching the lower levels of some of the buildings on Thursday. Twenty-six rescue teams are on site. The fire appears to have spread in part because the buildings were sheathed in bamboo scaffolding, a traditional building material that the authorities have been phasing out for safety reasons. Officials said they will also look at materials used in the buildings’ exterior they say may have contributed. A taskforce has been set up to investigate the cause of the fire. More than 900 people have been evacuated to temporary shelters as the rescue work continues. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, expressed his condolences for the victims, China’s state broadcaster said late on Wednesday. More than 128 fire engines and nearly 800 firefighters were sent to the scene. At least one firefighter was among the dead. The Wang Fuk Court towers are among the tallest in Tai Po, which, like much of Hong Kong, is among the most densely populated areas in the world."

Many more are in a critical condition and about 200 are missing. The fire was first reported at 2.52pm local time (06.52 GMT) on Wednesday, at the Wang Fuk Court residential complex in Tai Po, in the northern New Territories. The exact cause of the fire remains unknown, but officials say it started on the external scaffolding of Wang Cheong House before spreading to seven of the eight buildings on the densely packed site. As the fire raged, hundreds of people were evacuated from the complex of almost 2,000 apartments, which house about 4,800 residents, including many elderly people. A floorplan from one of the blocks gives an indication of the density of the living arrangements. About 200 fire trucks and more than 100 ambulances were deployed to the scene in the immediate aftermath of the fire breaking out. Firefighters worked through the night on Wednesday but struggled to reach the top floors of the 31-storey towers, where many people were thought to be trapped. A 37-year-old firefighter is known to be among the dead and 11 other firefighters were injured. Footage from Wednesday night showed the extent of the blaze. Falling debris and the extreme heat of the blaze made it difficult for rescuers to access buildings. Officials said the complex had been undergoing maintenance. The fire was able to spread quickly across bamboo scaffolding and construction netting that had been set up around the buildings, as well as highly flammable polystyrene foam in elevators. Hong Kong is one of the last places in the world where bamboo is widely used for construction and the local government has moved to start phasing it out, citing worker safety after 22 deaths involving bamboo scaffolders between 2019 and 2024. From the mainland, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, urged authorities in Hong Kong to “make every effort” to extinguish the blaze and “offered sympathies to the families of the victims and those affected by the disaster”. Police said that in addition to buildings being covered with protective mesh sheets and plastic that allegedly did not meet fire standards, windows on one unaffected building were sealed with a foam material, installed by a construction company carrying out maintenance work. By Thursday, a number of apartments were still burning, although witnesses said the blaze had noticeably lowered in intensity. Hong Kong’s chief executive, John Lee, said more than 900 people had sought refuge at temporary shelters. He said the government would set up a HK$300m ($38.6m, £29.2m) fund to help residents. Police have said the fire’s cause could have been a “grossly negligent” construction company using unsafe materials. On Friday, rescue operations were declared to be over. The head of the fire services, Andy Yeung, confirmed what many residents had been saying for days: that no fire alarms went off in any of the eight towers. “We will take enforcement actions against the contractors responsible,” he said. Officials said the fire was out but they needed to wait for the building to cool down before they could enter some areas, where temperatures were still upwards of 200C. They estimated it would take three to four weeks to collect evidence."

The General Medical Council (GMC) is investigating Dr Rahmeh Aladwan over posts and comments made across various social media platforms after several complaints, including from the Jewish Medical Association UK and the Campaign Against Antisemitism. The GMC counsel Emma Gilsenan told the MPTS hearing that Aladwan’s posts included content that allegedly “justifies terrorism, denies sexual violence, includes antisemitic conspiracy theories, misuses Holocaust and Nazi imagery and expresses support for proscribed groups and terrorist acts”. She added that Aladwan, a British Palestinian trainee in trauma and orthopaedics, had allegedly referred to the Royal Free hospital in London as a “Jewish supremacy cesspit”, doxed NHS colleagues for raising concerns about her, and expressed explicit support for proscribed organisations such as Hamas and Palestine Action. Gilsenan submitted that it was “unconscionable to consider that Dr Aladwan should be permitted to continue to practise”. Aladwan’s lawyer, Kevin Saunders, submitted that the posts “fell into the category of legitimate political speech and debate” and that she denied making racist or hate speech. He added that there was “no information to suggest that Dr Aladwan presents a real and immediate risk to patient safety”. In September, the MPTS ruled that it would not impose interim conditions on Aladwan’s registration, saying it did not believe the complaints against her were “sufficient to establish that there may be a real risk to patients”. However, the tribunal’s chair, Lee Davies, found on Wednesday that her alleged conduct “may impact on patient confidence in both her and the profession and patients may be discouraged from seeking treatment from her”. He said there had been “additional information” made available since September that “may indicate an escalation in the tone and nature of Dr Aladwan’s activities and posts, which may be considered to be extreme, offensive and antisemitic”. Davies said: “The tribunal considers that the allegations, if found proved, are serious and appear to have arisen from persistent and prolonged posting of potentially egregious material which has been widely disseminated by Dr Aladwan, resulting in a number of individual complaints made to the GMC. “While the tribunal is mindful of Dr Aladwan’s freedom of expression rights, it has noted a number of comments which allegedly support and celebrate terrorist acts and organisations, and promote violent action and offensive Jewish tropes.” He added that “many complaints” had been received “from individual members of the public and various organisations”. The interim suspension of 15 months on Aladwan, 31, took effect from Wednesday and will be reviewed within six months. The GMC and MPTS assess the conduct of doctors and decide whether sanctions, including being struck off the medical register, are necessary. The MPTS interim orders tribunals decide if a doctor’s practice should be restricted while a GMC investigation takes place, but do not reach their own conclusions. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, is seeking to overhaul the way medical regulators investigate cases of antisemitism after saying “the current medical regulatory system is completely failing to protect Jewish patients and NHS staff”."

The different scales of obstruction give rise to a mix of different frequencies of sound, resulting in something like white noise. Wind through pine trees is higher pitched because of the smaller size of pine needles, making a hissing or whispering sound. When indoors you may sometimes hear the wind howling. That sound is the airflow interacting with the sharp edges, gaps and openings of buildings, producing a note in the same way as blowing over the top of an empty bottle does. These are known as Aeolian tones after Aeolus, the Greek god of winds. When this effect, technically known as vortex shedding, matches the resonant frequency of an object such as a taut wire or line, the wire vibrates and hums in turn. It becomes an Aeolian harp string. Even where there are no other objects, what appears to be the sound of the wind is actually distorted airflow around the external structure of your ears. A pedant might argue that the wind itself is silent. What we hear is the just sound of various objects blowin’ in the wind. content/uploads/2014/10/aeolian-pipes-and-air-songs-facing-pages.pdf"

news_2025_nov_28_hong-kong-apartment-fire-response-rescue-operations-death-toll.txt,news,2025-11-28,"Helen Davidson and Shanshan Kao in Hong Kong, Amy Hawkins and Oliver Holmes",Rescue efforts end at Hong Kong tower block fire as death toll reaches 128,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/28/hong-kong-apartment-fire-response-rescue-operations-death-toll,"The death toll from the Hong Kong apartment complex fire that began on Wednesday has risen to 128 with as many as 200 missing, officials have said, as rescue operations were declared over. Firefighters had been combing through the high-rises on Friday, attempting to find anyone alive after the massive fire that spread to seven of eight towers in one of the city’s deadliest blazes. Authorities said they had recovered 108 bodies from the buildings, but 16 were still inside. Four people died of their injuries in hospital, Chris Tang, the city’s security secretary told the media on Friday afternoon. A further 79 people, including 11 firefighters, had been injured. About 200 people were still unaccounted for, and 89 of the bodies had not yet been identified. The head of the fire services, Andy Yeung, confirmed what many residents had been claiming for days: that no fire alarms went off in any of the eight towers. “We will take enforcement actions against the contractors responsible,” he said. Later on Friday, Hong Kong’s anti-corruption watchdog said it had arrested eight people. The group of seven men and one woman included “engineering consultants, scaffolding construction contractors and a middleman”, said the Independent Commission Against Corruption. Three other construction executives have already been detained. Officials have said the fire was finally out but they needed to wait for the building to cool down before they could enter some areas, where temperatures were still above 200C (390F). They estimated it would take three to four weeks to collect evidence. Throughout the morning, more people arrived at the Kwong Fuk estate community centre, adjacent to the towers, to identify the bodies being pulled from the gutted buildings. Few names of the dead have been released to the public yet, and Tang declined to release demographic information of those confirmed killed. Yeung said: “The fire in the building was extremely intense, with temperatures at the scene reaching 500 degrees, sometimes exceeding that.” That made it difficult to reach high floors, he added. “The interior spaces of the building were very narrow. Firefighters had to carry out operations unit by unit, floor by floor, and the units were cluttered with a large amount of items.” The blaze, which began on Wednesday afternoon, spread quickly through the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in the northern district of Tai Po. The eight-tower estate housing more than 4,600 people had been undergoing renovations and was wrapped in bamboo scaffolding and green mesh. On Friday afternoon, Tang said the green mesh was up to safety standards. Instead, they believed the highly flammable polystyrene foam discovered in every elevator window was the primary cause of the fire’s intensity. He said the blaze started from the lower part of the Wang Cheong tower, first in the mesh, then the foam, before spreading inside the building. High temperatures broke windows, allowing the fire to spread from unit to unit, helped along by high winds and falling debris from the burning mesh and scaffolding, Tang said. Hong Kong’s labour department said the building contractor had been reminded repeatedly in writing to take appropriate fire prevention measures after inspections over the last year revealed unsafe working practices. The most recent inspection was on 20 November. However, the department said the risk of fire was deemed to be relatively low and that the scaffold netting appeared to meet the standards for flame-retardant performance. Most of the dead were found in two of the seven towers that caught fire, and most survivors were pulled from the others. A man identified only as Mr Lau said his parents were missing, and he believed they had not survived. Sobbing, he told reporters he had no information. “At the scene I know nothing,” he said. “I just want to know if my parents are alive or dead. If they’ve died I don’t want to even see the bodies, I only want to know they’re gone so at least I won’t keep worrying.” Another resident, who lived on the 10th floor of one of the towers, said her family was safe but her neighbours were missing. “I don’t want to watch TV, I don’t want to look at community groups, I don’t want to read any news on my phone,” she said. “I just want life to go back to normal, but right now it feels very difficult.” Indonesia’s consul general, Yul Edison, arrived on Friday afternoon to help with identification of the bodies. Many Indonesians work as domestic helpers in flats such as those at Wang Fuk Court. Edison told reporters at least one Indonesian national was among the dead. A spokesperson for the Mission for Migrant Workers NGO said there were 11 Indonesian domestic helpers still missing, from 119 known to live in the building. The Philippines consulate said one Filipino domestic worker was still missing, one was injured, and 24 were accounted for. A crowdsourced web app has collated reports from people about each building, identifying individual flats in each tower, with available details of the residents. “A 41-year-old man went missing at 16.45,” said one report from block F, where the fire began. “His last message was that he was trapped in stairwell 25-26.” Another report confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man, a 90-year-old woman and a 40-year-old Indian national who lived with them as a domestic helper in an 11th-floor apartment. Eight floors above them, four people were reported to have died in one apartment. The fire has prompted calls for stronger fire safety laws in the construction sector. “There’s no law stipulating that flame-retardant materials must be used,” Lee Kwong-sing, the chair of Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner said, according to the state broadcasting service RTHK. “It is merely stated in the codes of practice by the labour department, so many people may not follow the requirements as it is not illegal. But if you turn such codes into a mandatory requirement … then that’ll be another story altogether.” Additional research by Lillian Yang"
news_2025_nov_28_hong-kong-community-groups-deliver-aid-to-survivors-of-wang-fuk-court-fire.txt,news,2025-11-28,Amy Hawkins,Hong Kong community groups deliver aid to survivors of Wang Fuk Court fire,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/28/hong-kong-community-groups-deliver-aid-to-survivors-of-wang-fuk-court-fire,"Hong Kong’s grassroots community groups have sprung into action to help coordinate and deliver aid to the survivors of the Wang Fuk Court fire, a catastrophic blaze that is confirmed to have killed at least 128 people, with hundreds still missing. Restaurants, churches and gyms in the Tai Po area, where the Wang Fuk Court housing estate is located, have been turned into temporary shelters for people in need of clothes, food and information as a result of the tragedy. Some have compared the sudden and well-organised mobilisation of volunteers to the support networks that emerged during the 2014 and 2019 pro-democracy protests, when thousands of Hongkongers helped to deliver supplies to the frontlines of the demonstrations. “Since the two movements in 2014 and 2019, citizen-led supplies mobilisation have become part of our muscle memory,” said Michael Mo, a former district councillor who now lives in the UK. A crowd-sourced web app has collated reports from people about each building, identifying individual apartments in each tower, with available details of the residents. People can mark themselves as safe, or submit information about who is still missing from certain apartments. Another website has an interactive map which shows where supply stations are available in the Tai Po area. There is also a platform for coordinating volunteer shifts. There are also numerous fundraising platforms that are collecting donations, including the government’s “Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po”, which has a startup donation of HKD$300m (£29,172,600) from the government. Messages flooded social media platforms and messaging apps with call-outs for help. On Telegram, the encrypted messaging app that was widely used during the pro-democracy protests, channels appeared for different duties such as Tai Po drivers, Tai Po helpers and Tai Po fire support. Users post lists of supplies that are needed at various locations, such as folding tables, mattresses and cleaning supplies. Many of the groups already have thousands of members. The Hong Kong Red Cross said its blood banks had eight to 10 days’ worth of supplies and it appealed to residents to book an appointment for future donations. Elsewhere, a group of Hong Kong lawyers posted a call-out on social media for volunteers to support victims with tenancy and land law questions, employment issues and other legal matters that may arise from the deadly blaze. The group said it was aiming to prepare a list of frequently asked questions to distribute to frontline NGOs and affected individuals to “help them understand their legal rights, options and possible next steps in a clear and accessible way”. The materials would be available in Chinese, English, and possibly other languages used by ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, the group said. At least two Indonesian domestic workers are confirmed to have died in the fire. Questions are already swirling about how the fire could have spread so quickly across the seven tower blocks in Wang Fuk Court that were affected. Residents had complained for more than a year about possible fire hazards in the building relating to the construction work that sheathed the blocks in bamboo scaffolding and green netting. Authorities have also pointed to the highly flammable Styrofoam used in elevator window coverings on every floor. On Friday, the head of the fire services, Andy Yeung, confirmed what many residents had been claiming for days: that no fire alarms went off in any of the towers. Three people associated with the contractor, Prestige, have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. The South China Morning Post reported that Prestige had been convicted of two safety offences in 2023, before it won the contract for the renovation works at Wang Fuk Court. Prestige has not commented on the disaster. Another crowd-sourced web project is an initiative to preserve the minutes of meetings of the Wang Fuk Court homeowners association, where concerns were raised about the bidding process for the renovation works. The labour department told residents last year that there was a relatively low risk of fire at the site. Nevertheless, it said the contractor had been repeatedly warned in writing about other unsafe working practices at Wang Fuk Court."
news_2025_nov_29_georgia-harris-neck-gullah-geechee.txt,news,2025-11-29,Melissa Hellmann,A Black Georgia community uprooted in 1942 still fights to go home,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/29/georgia-harris-neck-gullah-geechee,"A once thriving Black community along the Georgia coast called Harris Neck is now covered with greenery. During its heyday in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the area boasted a schoolhouse, general store, firehouse and seafood processing plants, and supported 75 Black households on 2,687 acres. The inhabitants were Gullah Geechee people, the descendants of formerly enslaved west Africans, who remained on the Sea Islands along the south-east US where they retained their distinct creole language and culture following the civil war. In 1942, though, the community was razed to the ground when the federal government kicked the families off of the land using eminent domain to build an army airfield. For nearly 50 years, the descendants of the Harris Neck community have fought to regain their ancestral land through peaceful protests and lobbying local and federal governments to no avail. Tyrone Timmons’ great grandfather’s oyster factory on more than 300 acres of land was one of the casualties during the government takeover. A few years ago, Timmons and his family walked the former oyster factory grounds for the first time in decades. A clearing lined with shrubbery and oak trees with low-hanging limbs led to a bluff that overlooked marshland. It was a profound experience for 52-year-old Timmons, “to be able to just walk on that property”, Timmons told the Guardian, “to just be able to feel that sense of being home, feeling complete”. Now, as the president of the advocacy group the Direct Descendants of Harris Neck Community (DDHNC), Timmons has continued his family’s legacy of watching over the grounds, even if he doesn’t live on them himself. Two advocacy organizations composed of descendants – Harris Neck Land Trust established in 2005 and DDHNC started in 2019 – have worked to educate the public and petition the government to return the land. Ultimately, the Harris Neck Land Trust wants the federal government to grant the descendant community, composed of thousands of people spread throughout the nation, 500 acres. They plan to open a Gullah Geechee restaurant and to grant plots to descendants, though the land trust believes that only a few dozen families would rebuild on the property. The land trust also plans to create a replica of a homestead that is open to the public, which will consist of a home, garden and live animals, and where descendants will engage in traditional Gullah Geechee practices such as weaving sweetgrass baskets. Additionally, DDHNC is requesting the original school to be rebuilt. In the meantime, older descendants are working to pass their knowledge to younger generations by hosting annual commemorations of the 1942 diaspora and offering tours of the former sites. DDHNC worked with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to create QR codes on placards stationed near some of the old buildings, which visitors scan to hear the history behind the locations as told by descendants. Brandon Lewis, the DDHNC’s vice-president, said he shares the community’s story with the youth through social media, with the hope of, “galvanizing everybody so that we move as one unit from the oldest to the youngest”. Throughout the years, the community has made small gains in its efforts to return home. The McIntosh county board of commissioners passed the Harris Neck resolution in 2007 to acknowledge the county’s role in taking over Harris Neck nearly 60 years earlier at the behest of the Harris Neck Land Trust. And in 2020, DDHNC secured a memorandum of understanding with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which has overseen the land since 1962. The memorandum of understanding outlines an agreement between the descendants and the government agency to work together in highlighting the Harris Neck community’s impact on the area. Even though the descendants have garnered a few incremental wins, they may face challenges from a federal administration that has opposed reparations for Black Americans and racial equity efforts. “With the election of Trump,” said Dave Kelly, the Harris Neck Land Trust’s former executive director, “there is no chance of victory for us during this administration.” Still, Timmons is hopeful that he will one day see the land returned to his family and other descendants. “We never gave up hope,” Timmons said. “Even right now, we have not given up hope of going back home.” ‘We lost everything’ The story of Harris Neck began after the civil war. In 1865, the plantation owner Margaret Ann Harris left in her will more than 2,000 acres of land to Robert Delegal, whom she formerly enslaved. Delegal later sold the land to 75 Gullah Geechee families. By the late 1800s, Harris Neck was a self-sufficient Black community. “We knew the land, we were farmers and fishermen,” said Wilson Moran, who is Gullah Geechee and an adviser for the Harris Neck Land Trust. “We did the crabs, the shrimp, the fish, the horses, the clams, the conch. We did rice, cotton and other agricultural products. So we became quite successful … we had our own fire station at our own school, and we had our own community.” That all changed during the second world war when the federal government assumed ownership of the land and families were only given a few weeks to move by 27 July 1942. “This was in July, at harvest time,” Moran said, “Therefore, we lost everything.” Seventy per cent of the landowners were Black, while about 20% were white. In return for seizing their land, the federal government compensated Black landowners $26.90 per acre on average, while white landowners were paid $37.31 per acre, according to a 1985 US Government Accountability Office report. Moran, now 82 years old, was the first to be born to the displaced community after they were forced off the land. He grew up in a shack two miles away from the original property and recalled hearing stories about his family quickly rebuilding their lives while his mom was pregnant with him. “They almost died,” Moran said, “but they survived.” In 1943, shortly after Moran was born, the US army corps of engineers constructed an airfield that was in use for one year. After the land sat unused for several years, the federal government conveyed it to McIntosh county to use it as a public airport. But the county mismanaged the land for more than a decade, resulting in illegal activities including gambling occurring there, according to the Harris Neck Last Trust. For the property’s latest iteration, the federal government transferred it to the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1966, creating the Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge that remains in operation today. Throughout Moran’s childhood, he heard stories from family members about Harris Neck’s zenith and their dream to one day return to the land. But Jim Crow policies were in effect at the time, so the families had little power to resist the government takeover. Following the civil rights movement in the late 1970s, former members of Harris Neck and their descendants hosted marches and erected tents on Harris Neck in an attempt to reclaim the property. Timmons recalled visiting the land at five years old in 1979. He watched his father and several other men – Edgar Timmons Jr, Ted Clark, Chris McIntosh Jr, Hercules Anderson – engage in a peaceful sit-in on the property. Federal marshals grabbed his father’s arms and dragged him and the other men to the back of a police van, Timmons recalled, and they spent more than 15 days in a Savannah jail. “My dad was not a criminal,” Timmons said. “All he was doing was just sitting in to get noticed, to get heard, to want to go home.” Following the protest, Edgar Timmons Jr and others in a group called the People Organized for Equal Rights filed a motion for the federal government to return Harris Neck in 1980. But a district judge in Georgia ruled against it, stating that only Congress could offer redress. The People Organized for Equal Rights unsuccessfully attempted to convince Congress to sponsor bills to help return the land to its original owners until the group eventually dissolved with few gains. But the initial movement sparked the creation of the Harris Neck Land Trust two decades later. Kelly, the Harris Neck Land Trust’s former executive director, was a writer in California in the early 2000s and became involved in the movement when he moved to Georgia to research the Harris Neck community. In 2005, Kelly, Moran, and the Rev Robert Thorpe – one of the original inhabitants of the community – created a trust to represent all 75 families. An advisory board consists of Gullah leaders such as Emory Campbell, and law professor and former Black Panther Party activist Kathleen Cleaver. Over the years, the Harris Neck Land Trust has researched court documents, federal and county records, located the families who lived on the land until the 1940s and lobbied Congress. The members were encouraged by other restorative justice efforts in recent decades such as the 1988 redress of more than $1.6bn to more than 80,000 Japanese Americans who were incarcerated during the second world war, and the return of 16,000 acres of land to the Colorado River Indian Tribes in 2005. Members of the trust testified before a congressional natural resources subcommittee in 2011, but the federal government didn’t budge in ceding any of the land back to the descendants. Congress was “deeply entrenched and resistant”, Kelly said. “They thought that if they gave us even 10 acres, that it would create a precedent that lots of people would use nationally. People would come out of the woodwork all over the country demanding their land back.” Meanwhile, another advocacy group formed. In 2019, Timmons’ aunt, Frances Timmons-Lewis, co-founded DDHNC to recognize the Timmons family’s contributions to the former community; her ancestors had employed thousands of Gullah people for their seafood processing plant. “It was a need to hear our side, to hear our story,” Timmons-Lewis said, “to shine the light of truth on the accomplishments of my grandfather, my grandmother and others who worked so hard and accomplished so much before the government came in and took that land”. In late July, attenders joined DDHNC’s fifth annual commemoration of the 1942 disbursement of the Harris Neck community. At the First African Baptist church in Townsend, Georgia, speakers from the descendant community talked about their movement over a breakfast of shrimp, gravy and grits. Afterwards, attendees toured the location of the original First African Baptist church, the old post office, courthouse, school, Timmons Oyster Factory, a convenience store, and lodges where women and men separately gathered. Those areas are now bare earth, with signs that show what once stood there. Lewis, Timmons-Lewis’s youngest son, hopes that his family’s efforts to preserve their history continue with future generations. “The main thing is the story,” he said. “We never want the story to be buried, and we want the truth to always stay at the top.”"

news_2025_nov_30_in-the-presence-of-evil-manchester-synagogue-attack-survivor-on-the-day-that-shook-british-jews.txt,news,2025-11-30,Josh Halliday North of England editor,‘In the presence of evil’: Manchester synagogue attack survivor on the day that shook British Jews,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/nov/30/in-the-presence-of-evil-manchester-synagogue-attack-survivor-on-the-day-that-shook-british-jews,"It was just after 6am and Yoni Finlay woke early with nerves. It was Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, and the 39-year-old Mancunian was due to sing the dawn prayer, Shacharis, before hundreds of worshippers later that morning. After practising his verse, Finlay buttoned up his white robes and headed to Heaton Park shul in north Manchester. He greeted familiar faces – exchanging a cheery hello with Bernard Agyemang, the security guard – then took a seat on the stage, the bimah, and said prayers. “And then we heard a bang,” he said. He remembers Alan Levy, the chair of the synagogue’s trustees, running into the synagogue saying “close the doors, close the doors”. Finlay rushed to the entrance to see what was happening. Through the reinforced glass, he saw Agyemang’s crumpled body on the ground. He turned to see Andrew Franks, a volunteer security guard, covered in blood. The moment that many in Britain’s Jewish community had feared was finally here. They were under attack. Finlay, a father of four, helped barricade the doors as the attacker tried to force his way in. “He was pulling them as we were holding them, and they were buckling,” he said. He saw the attacker’s knife – “I’ve never seen such a large blade on a knife” – and what looked like a bomb strapped to his waist. “He was shouting something to do with killing children.” In his first newspaper interview, Finlay told the Guardian he saw evil as he looked at the knifeman: “I’ve never felt this before, I’ve never experienced it, but there was evil. We were in the presence of evil. “It was his whole demeanour. He was angry. Very, very angry. He just wanted to kill Jews, and he was prepared to die for that.” Finlay did not know but the attacker, Jihad al-Shamie, had already called 999 accepting responsibility for his ongoing assault and pledging allegiance to Islamic State. Armed police arrived within seven minutes and shot Shamie, a Syria-born Mancunian, as he charged towards them. Somehow he got to his feet and lunged at them again. Police fired more shots, killing the assailant. Behind the synagogue door, Finlay felt “a very hard punch to his chest” and fell to the ground. “I knew straight away I’d been shot,” he said. A police bullet had penetrated the left side of his chest and exited through his back. Behind him, Adrian Daulby, 53, was also struck. Daulby, described by his family as a quiet man and a “tremendously strong hero”, was pronounced dead 40 minutes later. Another worshipper, Melvin Cravitz, 66, died in hospital a short time later from stab wounds. It was the deadliest antisemitic attack in Britain in recent memory. Seven weeks on, Finlay is recovering physically from his injuries after a seven-hour operation and two weeks in hospital. But the psychological scars are still raw. “I’ve got what I’ve been told is survivors guilt,” he said. “Whilst it was a miracle and I’m hugely grateful that I’m still here – I thank God every single day – but it doesn’t take away from the lives that were lost. And that’s very difficult.” There was fury in the Jewish community in Manchester and beyond in the days after the attack. The warning signs for an atrocity had been in plain sight for two years, they said. The justice secretary, David Lammy, was heckled and booed at a vigil where ministers were accused of having blood on their hands. The number of antisemitic incidents recorded by the Community Security Trust (CST) had risen sharply since Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel. A decade ago, 100 such incidents a month would be shocking but in the first half of 2025 the CST recorded more than 200 every month. In June, July and August that rose to 300 a month, according to the CST’s head of policy, Dave Rich. The hostility towards British Jews for the actions of Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israeli government – and the failure by UK ministers to address it robustly – had normalised antisemitism in the country, he said. “People don’t wake up in a morning and think I’m going to kill Jews, I’m going to attack a shul. It doesn’t just happen in a vacuum. It’s the result of what happens in the weeks, months and years leading up to it. “There’s an undercurrent [of antisemitisim] in the country and people lean into it … It’s not just the government – it’s the way the media have portrayed [the Gaza conflict]. That whole atmosphere allowed something like this to happen.” The decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from a match against Aston Villa in Birmingham this month over security fears plays into this surrender to antisemitism, he said: “How can it be that British citizens, or citizens of another country, Jewish people, can’t go to a certain area in England? We’re in 2025. How’s that been allowed to happen again? “It’s become normal to shout antisemitic things, to go on hate marches, and to be abusive towards Jews. Antisemitism has been allowed to fester in this country. “We can’t keep reacting to things that happen. There has to be real change. We have to stop normalising antisemitism, and the government does play a part in it.” Speaking at the Guardian’s Manchester office, Finlay stressed that he was not a politician and did not have all the answers. He is just a “very normal guy”, a Manchester United-supporting utility manager who can either be found on a football field or with this four children, a son aged 16 and three daughters aged nine, 12 and 14. He is very passionate about his volunteer work at the Friendship Circle, a charity supporting Jewish children and adults with learning difficulties and other disabilities. Finlay said he had not wanted to dwell on the attacker, who was raised barely two miles from his victims. Nor does he blame the armed officer whose bullet struck him and, he believes, Daulby: “They were doing their jobs. Their actions that day saved lives”. Heaton Park shul received more than 2,000 messages of support and solidarity in the days that followed 2 October. Many were from the non-Jewish community and Muslims, said Finlay, the “silent majority” who abhor discrimination: “They were from every religion, every society. People don’t want violence, they don’t want hate, they want to live in peace together.” As for the government, Finlay said it would be a mistake to push British Jews behind their already visibly guarded community. “The answer isn’t to keep putting up more walls and gates and we go further and further behind the gates. We’re not tackling the root cause of it,” he said. Finlay weighed carefully whether to speak publicly since the attack, mindful of the impact on those affected, including his family, and the sensitivities surrounding the Gaza conflict. He is doing so, he said, because he believes this should be the moment when compassion overcomes hate. “I saw evil and that’s something that in the moment was very powerful in the wrong way. But let’s combat it. Let’s bring light into the world, and it doesn’t take a lot,” he said. “Love, care, good. That overcomes hate. That ends hatred. We need to choose to learn and connect instead of dividing. Hope builds bridges, hate builds walls.”"

Boreas was depicted as a winged man in a billowing cloak holding a conch shell. He had a notoriously bad temper that produced violent storms, and he shipwrecked Odysseus and Hercules. But in some cities, Boreas was a hero and saviour. When a Persian fleet threatened Athens in about 480BC, an oracle instructed the Athenians to pray to the winds. According to Herodotus, “from clear and windless weather” a storm blew up out of the north that lasted for three days. The storm was said to have destroyed virtually all the Persian ships, causing the invasion to fail. The Athenians gave thanks by building a temple to Boreas and celebrating an annual festival, Boreasmus. Little is known about the event except that it included feasting. When it comes to saving cities, Boreas was a bronze age superhero. He protected Megalopolis from an invasion by the Spartans and destroyed a fleet from Syracuse that threatened Thuria. Both cities gave thanks by building temples, and Thuria granted the deity honorary citizenship. It might seem odd to celebrate Boreas’s wintery blasts, but as the saying goes, it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good."

In this week’s newsletter we have charts on … how common museum heists actually are, 65,000 years of Indigenous oral history on one timeline, the staggering rise of political protests under Donald Trump, and a look at how statistics can predict the release date of iconic pop tune Mambo No 5. But first … bird migration is changing. What does this reveal about our planet? If you thought we would stop talking about birds even though the bird of the year competition is over, you were sorely mistaken. Our colleagues in the UK produced this beautiful visual feature about bird migration patterns and how they are changing, which I can’t recommend enough. It combines bird GPS data, illustrations and excellent maps to show how migration patterns are changing in response to a changing climate and other changes to the birds’ environment. Four charts from the fortnight *** 1. “No Kings Day” anti-Trump protests likely the largest single-day political protest ever G Elliott Morris, writing at Strength in Numbers, has partnered with the the Xylom to produce crowdsourced estimates of participant numbers at the No Kings protests. According to their estimates, the No Kings protests are likely to be the largest single-day political protest ever, with a median estimate of 5 million people taking part. Elliott has also charted the cumulative number of protests, showing Trump’s second term is facing far more popular opposition than the first: Read more here. *** 2. 65,000 years of Indigenous oral history in one feature This is an absolutely amazing piece of work – the (Australian) ABC spent five years working on this interactive feature that brings together First Nations oral histories spanning 65,000 years. The centrepiece of the feature is a timeline which starts 65,000 years ago and puts Australian First Nations cultural knowledge into context with defining events across different eras, until we reach the present. You can also explore the same stories and histories either mapped to relevant places, or grouped together by topics. *** 3. It’s a heistogram chart* One of the biggest stories of the week was the daring Louvre jewel heist. The Economist quickly put together this chart and story which shows that museum heists are surprisingly common: According to the Economist, there have been at least 40 cases of theft from French museums between 1990 and 2022! *I (Nick) stole this joke from Danny Dougherty on Bluesky. Sorry Danny, it was too good. *** 4. Overdose deaths rising in some regions even as US sees national decline Overdose deaths continued to rise in some communities across the US even as they declined nationally in 2024, according to an exclusive data analysis by the Guardian which found wide geographical disparities in fatalities linked to the public health crisis. While overdoses declined nationally between August 2023 and December 2024 (the most recent month when county-level data is available), they increased by as much as 120% during that time in some US counties.

Thanks to data enthusiast Damie Pak, it turns out the answer to this is yes, yes you can! I’m not going to lie, the actual statistics involved here are beyond me, but essentially Damie has used the distribution of name popularity for all of the women in the song, adjusted them for the lag time from birth to adulthood, and then put it all together using STATISTICS to create this distribution with a centralised point at 1999, which is the actual release year: I am actually amazed it lined up so well. The runner-up for Off the Charts this week was a graphic from USA Today, which compares the weight of prize-winning giant pumpkins to various things. Did you know a prize-winning pumpkin can weigh as much as a male adult walrus? Well now you do. Incidentally the whole “comparing things to amounts of other things” to show weight, distance, number of people etc is such a regular media trope that I have long dreamed of making a system which gives you the units of Things in Other Things in a Nice Graphic. For example, you could put in an amount of liquid and get a automatic visualisation showing how many Olympic swimming pools’ worth of water it is.

news_2025_oct_28_a-sprawling-global-family-the-long-wave-turns-one.txt,news,2025-10-29,Nesrine Malik,A sprawling global family: The Long Wave turns one,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/oct/28/a-sprawling-global-family-the-long-wave-turns-one,"The Long Wave is one! I can’t believe it’s been a whole year. It genuinely feels as if we are just getting started. When we launched the newsletter, I wrote about how it was born first and foremost out of curiosity, of interest in how we passed our food, culture and habits down and across the world, how we mixed recipes, languages, shared music. Our instinct was that there is a sprawling global family, rich in untold stories. That instinct has been validated and surpassed. What follows is only a small sample of what we have covered over the past year. Exploring the breadth and depth of the Black diaspora I start with this particularly poignant conversation with the Sudanese-British artist Elmiene, touching on themes of displacement, war, the comfort of music, gathering in celebration, and the connective tissue of culture. I think about it often. And how this young man, brought up in the UK but constantly replenishing from the well of his origin country of Sudan, did not become estranged from either, but fused them into a love letter to home. “I’m here in LA or New York and at the same time my grandmother’s hearing bullets and grenades,” Elmiene explains. “Is this where I should have been? What am I doing being a fucking musician? I feel like a clown sometimes.” How Brazil celebrates its Black heritage I learned a huge amount from this conversation with our correspondent in South America, Tiago Rogero. Rogero is a journalist with an academic’s intellect, and so his approach to the news is always grounded in prodigious historical context and sharp political insight. Here, he tells me about how Brazil’s Black population, the largest outside Africa, celebrates its history while navigating the challenges of present day Brazil. “We fight for the right to feel comfortable in our own skin, our own cities, in our own country. We are the ones who literally built this country and we should be the ones who own it.” *** Michelle Obama 2.0 In one of our most popular editions, I traced Michelle Obama’s transformation from towering political icon to relatable podcast auntie. But her journey maps out on to a larger historical moment, one where her embodiment of “girlboss” feminism and “Black Girl Magic” lost steam to give us a more vulnerable, fallible, and tremendously more likeable Michelle. “What happened that eight years that we were in the White House? We got out alive; I hope we made the country proud. But what happened to me?” *** Dancing on the streets of Barbados When our Jason Okundaye went to Barbados to participate in Crop Over festival, it is no exaggeration to say that he returned to the office a changed man. His dispatch not only covers the political and economic transformation of Barbados, but also reveals that electric shock of recognition that comes from travelling within the Black diaspora. “It is almost cliche to say that dancing in the street is a liberating experience but, as someone who, admittedly, can be uptight, the parade completely unravelled me and released me from all inhibitions.” *** Caribbean Cuisine When I spoke to Keshia Sakarah, author of Caribe: A Caribbean Cookbook with History, I was bowled over by how detailed and expansive her work of tracing the historical roots of Caribbean food was. It was simultaneously; a recipe book, a record of history through ingredients, and a recognition of the role cuisine plays in anchoring identity and preserving memory. It made me wish someone would do something similar for Sudanese food (spoiler, someone did. Stay tuned!). As Sakarah tells me: “When an elder passes, they go with all their knowledge, so it’s important to archive things for the purposes of preservation”. *** Nigeria’s Super Falcons This year’s Women’s Africa Cup of Nations had it all. A high drama final, social media stars, and, as ever, politics trying to steal the valour of sports. The Guardian’s West Africa correspondent, Eromo Egbejule, talked me through the reasons for the Nigerian team’s superpower after they won their tenth trophy. His expert diagnosis as a Nigerian himself? The team’s strength is in its mental edge. “Nigerians thrive in chaos,” Eromo suggests, half in jest and half with a sort of national pride, in reference to a playing style that bewilders and scatters the strategic plans of their opponents. And on that note, The Long Wave is looking forward to covering the men’s Africa Cup of Nations, which kicks off in December, and is already the subject of hectic excitement and speculation on the continent. Thank you for reading this past year, for all your generous feedback and suggestions, and for being a part of the growing Long Wave diaspora family. • To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday, please subscribe here."

Inside the 31 October Guardian Weekly,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/oct/29/putin-under-pressure-inside-the-31-october-guardian-weekly,"Donald Trump’s sudden decision last week to sanction Russian oil producers suggested the US president has finally lost patience with Vladimir Putin after a series of fruitless talks over ending the war in Ukraine. Could it break the deadlock? Oil sanctions have the potential to genuinely damage Moscow’s finances, as the Russian president himself admitted last week. It remains to be seen, though, whether economic pressure alone can bend Putin’s arm over a conflict he views as defining to his legacy. In this week’s big story, Guardian Russia affairs reporter Pjotr Sauer asks whether sanctions could succeed where diplomacy has failed, while Christopher S Chivvis of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argues that a negotiated settlement remains the likeliest way to bring nearly four years of fighting to a halt. In the frontline Ukrainian city of Kupiansk, senior reporter Peter Beaumont finds little hope of a quick resolution, with much of the population having left and the remaining soldiers stuck in a war they believe is “going nowhere for either side”.

Looking out of my window I am mesmerised by the fiery leaves and deep red berries on a nearby rowan tree and the golden hues of a silver birch. But it is nearly November. How come autumn is lingering so late? New research shows that the trend towards longer growing seasons and rain falling less frequently but in more extreme bursts has shifted autumn back by about two weeks over the past 40 years. Yangjing Nie, from the University of Beijing, China, and colleagues used satellite images and weather data to assess how changes in rainfall had impacted the timing of mid to high latitude northern hemisphere trees putting on their autumn display between 1982 and 2020. They found that the increased overall levels of rainfall during the growing season and the decreased frequency of rainstorms both contributed to autumn being delayed. Writing in Geophysical Research Letters they describe how the extra rainfall helped to keep soils moist for longer and promoted soil mineralisation, providing plants with more moisture and nitrogen and allowing them to hold on for longer before dropping their leaves. The findings will help us better understand the impact of climate change on growing season length and better estimate how much carbon plants are able to absorb."
news_2025_oct_31_80-years-pan-african-congress-manchester-black-history.txt,news,2025-10-31,Chris Osuh Community affairs correspondent,‘A sense of freedom’: 80 years on from the Pan-African Congress in Manchester,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/oct/31/80-years-pan-african-congress-manchester-black-history,"On the main road heading south out of Manchester city centre, the excitement and enthusiasm are tangible. Oxford Road has changed a lot since October 1945. While its grand buildings remain, the wartime bombsites and smog are long gone. Much of Chorlton-on-Medlock, the residential area it bisected has been lost to postwar clearances and replaced by university complexes. But to the young people gathered in the foyer of the Contact Theatre, the events of 80 years ago were full of relevance. The dance show they came to see – See My World: Homage, staged by the choreographers Joe Price and Kieron Simms a fortnight ago – was just one of an unprecedented number of events to celebrate the anniversary of the fifth Pan-African Congress, which took place less than a mile away at the former town hall. The congress was a seismic moment for Black countries during their fight for independence from colonial rule and helped to shape the destiny of millions. But for years the event was an under-recognised chapter in Manchester’s radical history, spurring the late community leader Kath Locke, among others, to campaign for a commemorative plaque outside the building in the 1980s. Now, against a backdrop of increasing unity between African-Caribbean countries, resurgent anti-Black sentiment and increased awareness of the debt Manchester owes to slavery and colonialism, the congress’s message of Black unity as well as political and economic liberation is experiencing a resurgence. Tunde Adekoya, the artistic director and chief executive of the See My World festival – which celebrates Manchester’s pan-Africanist legacy – has been central to the 80th anniversary celebrations, organising a series of seminars, exhibitions and performances. Adekoya’s introduction to the congress came 10 years ago and it has inspired his work ever since. “It was a struggle that resonated with mine, and I decided had to look at ways to continue to develop our communities in the same way (as the congress), creating a festival that would allow people to have these conversations, to look at what betterment would [look] like through events and storytelling, reclaiming narratives and looking at how we develop the next generation of leaders,” he said. While the legacy of the event continues to resonate within Manchester’s arts and activist communities, African and Caribbean politicians are taking steps to fulfil the dreams of the original delegates. In September, the African Union revealed it was joining forces with Caribbean countries to seek reparations from European colonial powers. The announcement, at the second Caricom-Africa summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, came as the regions strengthened their commitment to cooperate on global financial reform, climate action, education, health, trade and cultural exchange. The Caricom secretary general, Dr Carla Barnett, said the summit was “guided by the pan-African ideals set out by iconic minds from the Caribbean and from Africa, with Marcus Garvey, Patrice Lumumba, George Padmore, Jomo Kenyatta and Kwame Nkrumah among them”. The Jamaican activist Amy Ashwood Garvey, the former wife of the pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey, was a delegate at the 1945 event – which was chaired the African American intellectual William Edward Burghardt Du Bois – alongside Nkrumah, Kenyatta, the Trinidadian journalist Padmore, Dr Hastings Banda, Jaja Wachuku and Obafemi Awolowo. After independence, Nkrumah, Kenyatta and Banda went on to lead Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, respectively, while Wachuku and Awolowo became statesmen in Nigeria. Alma La Badie, the Women’s Auxiliary air force veteran who campaigned for the rights of Black women and children in the UK, and Len Johnson, the trade unionist and boxer of mixed heritage who grew up in working-class Clayton, east Manchester, were among those who represented Black Britain at the congress. Dr Shirin Hirsch, a historian at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) and at the People’s History Museum, said: “The congress was electric, hosting 200 attendants with 87 delegates representing 50 organisations from across the world. Many delegates would return to Africa newly inspired as part of a network of pan-Africanists. “The hall itself was grand, with handmade posters … calling for oppressed people of the world to unite; ‘freedom for all subject people’ was another demand. Karl Marx was quoted – ‘Labour in the white skin can never free itself as long as labour in the black skin is branded’ – and there was a call for ‘Arab and Jews to unite against British imperialism’. “For Manchester’s Black delegates and observers to the congress, we know it was a hugely important event too, with attenders like Len Johnson continuing to organise against racism for decades after.” Ntombizodwa “Zodwa” Nyoni, a writer and lecturer at MMU, played a critical role in building excitement around the anniversary celebrations via her hit play based on the congress, Liberation, shown at the Royal Exchange theatre. She was keen to highlight crucial messages from the pan-Africanism of 1945 for an audience in 2025. “A lot of [the delegates’ concerns] around being anti-racist and thinking about freedom of the press, thinking about all the rights of women – all of those things are really relevant to where we’re at today,” she said in an interview for a bonus episode of the Guardian’s Cotton Capital podcast. “Today, when we think [about our] activism, a lot of it is happening online. So there’s something specific and … special about what happens when a group of people meet and they say: ‘We are going to sit together and plan change.’” From debates to concerts and exhibitions to literary readings, several institutions in Greater Manchester – including MMU, the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Centre, the Caribbean and African Health Network and the flagship arts venue Factory International – have staged events centred on the Black diaspora that have climaxed in the anniversary month of October, which is also Black History Month in the UK. In Moss Side and Hulme, historical centres of postwar Black life in Manchester, the political festival The World Transformed brought pan-African activists together, adding to the city’s rich legacy of Black activism. The historian Hirsch added: “Manchester during the second world war had this thriving Black community that had settled here before the [Empire] Windrush ship and a later generation joined them. “Within this community was a very active pan-Africanist network. In fact, the British state had pinpointed Manchester as the centre of the pan-Africanists during the war. The Negro Association in Manchester was a key network, established in 1943 by Dr Peter Milliard, that provided the basis for the Manchester branch of the Pan-African Federation. “It actively encouraged solidarity with anticolonial struggles, for example: raising money in support of the Nigerian general strike in 1945. On the Negro Association membership lists – on show at the People’s History Museum – there are very famous names like Jomo Kenyatta, future president of Kenya, who lived and worked in Manchester for a short time, but there are also many local Black Mancunian members that we still know very little about. “The central pan-Africanist in Manchester was T Ras Makonnen, who was the real force behind the congress taking place in Manchester. Makonnen set up a whole range of restaurants, bookshops and even a tea shop around the Oxford Road that were able to attract a huge audience because they did not operate a colour bar and welcomed Black GIs and other racialised communities. “From these ventures, Makonnen was able to finance the congress. His links with the local Labour party, [which] had political control of the city, meant they could secure the large Chorlton-on-Medlock town hall (now an MMU building) as the venue for the congress. “It is hard, from these media reports, to get a sense of the exhilaration and sense of freedom that Black people must have felt meeting and organising in Manchester. Walking into the town hall for the congress, with the flags of Black nations on display, there must have been a feeling of pride and determination to continue the struggle.” This pride and determination is still felt today. Edna, who came out on a chilly October night to see Homage at the Contact Theatre, said: “I was born in Portugal but my origins are from São Tomé and Príncipe. Believing in pan-Africanism means believing in yourself, claiming who you are and always fighting for what matters.”"

news_ng-interactive_2025_dec_01_voting-in-victoria-is-broken-heres-how-it-could-be-fixed-and-who-would-benefit.txt,news,2025-12-01,"Josh Nicholas, Benita Kolovos, Andy Ball, Nick Evershed and Ben Raue",Voting in Victoria is broken. Here’s how it could be fixed and who would benefit,https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/01/voting-in-victoria-is-broken-heres-how-it-could-be-fixed-and-who-would-benefit,"In Victoria, your vote can help elect someone you’ve never heard of. That’s because the state is the only jurisdiction in Australia that still uses group voting tickets (GVTs) to elect its upper house, the Legislative Council. What is a GVT? Under this system, voters can simply mark one party above the line on the ballot paper. If that party is eliminated during counting, the party – not the voter – decides how their preferences will be distributed. Like preferential voting in a federal election, vote counting is done in rounds in Victorian state elections. If no single candidate has reached the quota of votes required to win a seat in the round, then the person with the lowest number of votes is eliminated. Those votes are redistributed according to the preferences of the voter if they voted below the line, or the party that was eliminated if the vote was above the line. Sometimes this can lead to candidates getting elected who have only received a minuscule number of primary votes. The best example comes from the 2018 election. Here’s how the voting played out: GVTs have long been exploited, with backroom deals allowing little-known candidates to leapfrog rivals with 10 times as many first-preference votes. But the 2018 election result was so egregious that even the political strategist Glenn Druery, the so-called “preference whisperer”, expected the practice would be scrapped as a result. This is the central issue with GVTs and these preference deals – as the smaller parties get eliminated towards the end of counts, their preferences flow to each other. This can quickly accumulate and allow them to overtake candidates who received more direct support. As a result, major parties can win fewer seats than expected, given their larger vote totals. And minor parties can pick up seats from extraordinary low primary votes. Such as in 2018: The Greens MP Tim Read, the party’s spokesperson for integrity, says 20% of Victoria’s upper house in 2018 was effectively chosen via a “financially arranged cartel system”. He says this had serious implications early in the Covid-19 pandemic. “The balance of power in the upper house – the final yes or no on legislation that governs our state – was being dictated by people more answerable to Glenn Druery than they are to Victorians,” Read says. The Liberals’ leader in the upper house, David Davis, says the party also opposes the exploitation of GVTs. “We always had trouble where a party that was patently of the left was preferencing a party of the right, and a party of the right was patently preferencing a party of the left and the risk that perverse results occur,” Davis says. “These are often not the results that the actual voters intended.” Both the Liberals and the Greens called on Labor to act before the 2022 election, as did the government-led electoral matters committee in its review of the 2018 poll. But the system remained in place, with Druery working behind the scenes once again. Progressive parties joined forces to create their own tickets to counter his influence. This included a “sting” operation by the Animal Justice party, whose candidate Georgie Purcell won a seat in parliament as a result of Druery’s deals, only for the party to direct its preferences to the progressive bloc at the last minute. As a result, Druery’s tactics were less successful in 2022 and Barton, among others, weren’t elected. But the GVT system remains in place, ready to be exploited once again come the 2026 state poll. So how should the system change? Change may finally be coming. The electoral matters committee, in its 2022 election review, again called for GVTs to be scrapped. It ordered a separate inquiry, which for several months has been considering six potential replacement options. This inquiry, led by the Labor MP Dylan Wight, is due to hand down its final report this week. Wight said the inquiry heard evidence from a variety of stakeholders, including political parties and psephologists. “There were a diverse range of views in regard to what Victoria’s upper house and the way it is elected may look like in the future,” he says. Guardian Australia has analysed each model proposed by the electoral matters committee using the actual vote totals in the 2022 election. For each model we first assigned seats to candidates whose primary votes exceeded the quota needed for a seat, then assumed those that were leading the vote would win the remaining seats. This is a simplification, as things such as voting behaviour, candidate selection and even party formation would probably change given a different electoral system. But it shows the relative impacts of the different electoral models. While momentum is growing to scrap GVTs, even within Labor’s ranks, almost all the proposals put forward by the committee would require a referendum, which both Read and Davis believe is unlikely before November 2026. According to Labor sources, the most likely scenario is that the government would introduce legislation to scrap GVTs in the first quarter of 2026 while retaining the current upper house structure. But this would face opposition from most crossbenchers, including the Legalise Cannabis party and the Animal Justice party – three votes in the upper house the government has come to rely on to pass its legislative agenda. The Legalise Cannabis MP Rachel Payne described scrapping GVTs without replacing them as “self-serving” as it would probably “see Labor save a few MPs, the Liberals pick up a few”. She’s concerned One Nation would benefit most. Payne says to truly ensure proportional representation, the upper house regions need to be scrapped. Purcell agrees, saying undertaking electoral reform “in the wrong order” would “sign the death warrant for some of our state’s most effective legislators”. She says abolishing GVTs but keeping the regions would be “fundamentally terrible for democracy”. The government has pushed through several pieces of legislation this year and added an additional sitting week, while fewer are scheduled next year – perhaps in preparation for the frosty reception it will receive from the crossbench. Victorian Labor has also delayed its preselections in the upper house as it awaits an outcome on GVTs. The Libertarian MP David Limbrick put it bluntly: “If GVTs were simply removed, I imagine the response from most minor parties would be to make the lives of the major parties as miserable as possible until November 2026.” Ben Raue is an electoral analyst and blogger who writes about elections in Australia at www.tallyroom.com.au"
news_ng-interactive_2025_dec_06_bloodshed-was-supposed-to-stop-no-sign-of-normal-life-as-gazas-killing-and-misery-grind-on.txt,news,2025-12-06,"Seham Tantesh in Gaza, Julian Borger and Emma Graham-Harrison in Jerusalem",‘Bloodshed was supposed to stop’: no sign of normal life as Gaza’s killing and misery grind on,https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/06/bloodshed-was-supposed-to-stop-no-sign-of-normal-life-as-gazas-killing-and-misery-grind-on,"When Jumaa and Fadi Abu Assi went to look for firewood their parents thought they would be safe. They were just young boys, aged nine and 10 and, after all, a ceasefire had been declared in Gaza. Their mother, Hala Abu Assi, was making tea in the family’s tent in Khan Younis when she heard an explosion, a missile fired by an Israeli drone. She ran to the scene – but it was too late. Since the US-brokered ceasefire was announced on 10 October, Israeli forces have killed more than 360 Palestinians in Gaza; according to a UN official, at least 70 are children – like Jumaa and Fadi. They were killed, their mother said, at “a time when bloodshed was supposed to stop”. “After the ceasefire was announced, I felt a bit of safety and believed that nothing would harm my children any more,” Abu Assi said. “But fate had another plan.” She is focused now on keeping her two surviving daughters alive. “I still hear explosions and gunfire,” she said. “I do not feel that the war has ended.” The toll from Israeli attacks in Gaza has fallen significantly compared with the preceding two years of war, when on average 90 Palestinians were killed each day, but significant numbers of civilians are still losing their lives. On average, Israeli weapons now kill seven people a day. That rate of violent death would be considered an active conflict in many other contexts, raising questions about how accurately “ceasefire” describes the new status quo. “It’s something that if you want to you can call a ceasefire, which is very convenient for the Americans and for everyone who wants this off their television screens and off their streets and off their annoying parliamentary and political schedules,” said Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator and the president of the US/Middle East Project. “It is very convenient for Israel. The pressure is off and they have smashed the whole place up, and can still kill as they please.” Amnesty International has alleged that Israel is still committing genocide in Gaza and that the use of the term ceasefire “risks creating a dangerous illusion that life in Gaza is returning to normal”. The Israeli military has made clear it is still operating a shoot-to-kill policy around its positions. It acknowledged the drone strike on Jumaa and Fadi Abu Assi, describing the two young boys collecting wood to feed and warm their family as “suspects” who threatened Israeli soldiers. ‘Yellow line’ hardens Like many of those killed under the ceasefire, the young brothers were targeted for approaching the “yellow line” to which the army has withdrawn under the truce. It now bifurcates Gaza, giving Israel the lion’s share. In the original ceasefire map Israel would continue to occupy 53% of the Gaza Strip, but the Israeli army unilaterally expanded that to 58% when it laid down markers to delineate its territory. This division is Gaza’s new reality, with the US military preparing for an indefinite partition into what it calls a “green zone” under Israeli and international military control, where reconstruction would start, and a “red zone” to be left in ruins. According to a geographical analysis by Forensic Architecture, the great bulk of Gaza’s fertile farmland is in Israeli hands, while the population is mostly confined to the barren coastal sand dunes, the “red zone”. The ceasefire proposals put forward by Donald Trump, enshrined in large part in a UN security council resolution last month, imagined further steps after the first-phase hostage and prisoner exchange and the pullback to the “yellow line”. Israeli forces are supposed to continue to withdraw, to be replaced by an international stabilisation force (ISF) overseen by a “peace board” chaired by Trump, with other world leaders of his choosing, with a technocratic Palestinian committee to conduct day-to-day governance. However, these phases, even more difficult to agree than the initial halt to fighting, were left purposefully vague and remain just as hazy two months on. Israel has been adamant there can be no progress from the first phase until all the bodies of hostages killed during the war are returned and Hamas is disarmed. Hamas has found and returned all but one of the bodies and has said it is prepared to discuss handover of offensive weapons, such as rocket launchers and rockets, but not to Israel or any Israeli-backed entity. The UN resolution in November suggested the ISF could lead the disarmament, but none of the countries supposed to be contributing troops, such as Indonesia, Azerbaijan or Pakistan, are willing to send soldiers to take weapons from Hamas against its will. A EU-sponsored training programme for Palestinian police involving recruits from Gaza and the West Bank, which was under way in Egypt and Jordan before the ceasefire, is due to be expanded. But without a governing authority for Gaza it is uncertain who would direct such a force, and Israel has made clear it will not countenance anything with a Palestinian national character. Against this backdrop of uncertainty and delay, there are growing signs that the “yellow line” is hardening into something more permanent, a partition of Gaza. The army has been building concrete outposts along the “yellow line”, creating new free-fire areas around them. On the Israeli-occupied side of the line, the army has continued to flatten Palestinian neighbourhoods wrecked by the war, despite the Trump plan’s commitment to reconstruction. What will rise in their place, if anything, is unclear. Israel has indicated it will allow construction only in the “green zone” it occupies, and plans developed by the US government and military envisage scattered fenced camps, rather than rebuilding Palestinian communities. Referred to as “alternative safe communities” (ASCs), they would be little more than refugee camps, with Palestinians living in prefabricated units or repurposed shipping containers, with shared community toilets and showers. Residents would be vetted to exclude any Palestinian who had been paid by Hamas even in a civilian role, or who had a relative, including cousins, aunts and uncles, who had been on any Hamas payroll. It is not clear if those who moved to the Israeli-controlled areas would be allowed to cross back to the western zone of Gaza. Several humanitarian organisations and European countries have refused to take part in planning for ASCs, on the grounds the project could break international law. They fear the ASCs could be used as a tool of coercive displacement, and exploit civilian needs to pursue military goals. The US is also ignoring basic issues such as land ownership, said Amjad Iraqi, the senior analyst for Israel and Palestine at the International Crisis Group. “American officials coming in with this sort of blank slate approach, that you just can sort of reconstruct things from scratch as if nothing existed before, no houses or no communities or no land registrations in the areas. It breaks every international law in the book,” Iraqi said. Even if the US does push ahead with a pilot ASC planned for Rafah, the project will do almost nothing to ease the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Mountains of rubble dotted with unexploded bombs must be cleared before construction can start and even the most optimistic timeline allows for six months’ work before the first Palestinians move in, sources briefed on the plans said. When completed it would house only 25,000 people, barely 1% of Gaza’s population. Locked in dire conditions Meanwhile, the ceasefire deal as it stands leaves Gaza’s remaining 2.2 million Palestinians hemmed into just 42% of their former territory, and locked into dire conditions. Palestinians are by no means safe from Israeli strikes, many of which have been in “relocation areas” set aside for them, according to the Forensic Architecture analyst group. Nine in 10 Palestinians in Gaza are without homes, which have been reduced to ruins. The latest satellite data suggests 81% of dwellings have been destroyed or severely damaged by Israeli bombardment. Most live in tents, vulnerable to the coming winter. Two heavy downpours in November flooded Gaza’s tented camps, washing away hundreds ,if not thousands, of shelters. In the most recent deluge, on 25 November, tents in Deir al-Balah collapsed under the pressure of water pouring in from all directions. Some people tried digging channels to divert the water away, while most stayed huddled in their tents. Much of the flood water came from overflowing sewage pits nearby. “We are very concerned about water-borne diseases given the dire hygiene situation and lack of sufficient sanitation. We are concerned that diseases like cholera could appear if the situation doesn’t improve as soon as possible,” said Jonathan Crickx, spokesperson for the UN child protection agency, Unicef, in Palestine. “There’s been a significant spike in acute watery diarrhoea over the past four weeks affecting children above five.” Food supplies in Gaza have increased since the declaration of the ceasefire. Aid deliveries have gone up from an average of 91 trucks a day in the month before the 10 October truce, to 133 a day in the following month. A reduction in looting also makes it easier for aid groups to reach the most vulnerable people. Before the ceasefire, most aid was stolen by gangs or desperate Palestinians before reaching its destination. At the same time, non-UN shipments, including commercial supplies and deliveries from Arab countries, have increased at a faster rate. According to World Food Programme figures, commercial shipments have nearly quadrupled from 37 trucks a day in September to 144 trucks daily in the first week of November. The influx of commercial goods has reduced prices in markets from the astronomical levels of the war. Flour in the Deir al-Balah market costs four shekels (93p) a kg, a kg of sugar is five shekels (£1.16), a single egg four shekels, and a chicken 35 shekels (£8.11). A tent costs between 1,000 and 2,000 shekels (£231 to £462). But even these prices are beyond the vast majority of Palestinians, who have exhausted their savings after two years without work and now rely on aid. However, the total inflow of goods remains below the prewar average of 600 trucks a day, while the needs of the population have increased exponentially, as the war has robbed almost all Palestinians of shelter, their livelihoods, schools and hospitals. “We’re not seeing major increases in the scope of stuff that is coming in,” said Sam Rose, the acting director for Gaza for Unrwa, the UN relief agency serving Palestinians in the region. Unrwa is by far the biggest aid agency in Gaza, but has been banned by Israel, which claims some of its 13,000 employees in the territory took part in the October 2023 attack on Israel that ignited the war. World risks being complicit European and Arab states justified their support for the Trump proposals at the UN resolution that codified them as a way to keep the US engaged in peace efforts and to give his proposed steps some form of legitimacy – and at least a nod towards some future Palestinian state. They have rationalised their involvement in the Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) along similar lines, pointing to modest improvements in aid deliveries in the hope of containing the threat of famine. The CMCC, established in a warehouse in Kiryat Gat, southern Israel, is staffed by the Israeli and US militaries along with liaison officers from other countries backing the ceasefire. There is no Palestinian representation. Observers warn European and Arab states as well as aid agencies that without significant advances in the peace process, the CMCC risks being complicit with the Israeli military in a status quo that keeps Palestinians in inhuman conditions, and in schemes such as the ASC plan, in contravention of humanitarian law. “An army that has just committed a genocide has 30, 40 other militaries now collaborating with it in its back yard,” Daniel Levy said. Rose said: “There’s not as much international outrage and pressure directed towards Israel these days, but the fact is that people are living in miserable conditions and continue to be killed in spite of the ceasefire. “Palestinians are being confronted with these multiple possible futures over which they have zero control. So that element of helplessness, psychological torture and cruelty they’ve endured for the past two years – that persists.” Faiq al-Sakani has nowhere to take his family of nine other than the wrecked shell of their home in Gaza City’s Tuffah district, about 500 metres from the “yellow line”. For the 37-year-old, no day is without anxiety that his children could die. “The situation is extremely tense. Every day, we hear the sounds of tanks moving, firing shells, and shooting in all directions,” he said on Thursday. “Just yesterday, a group of my relatives was directly targeted in the area; three of them were killed, and several others were critically injured.” “It feels as if the war is still ongoing and there has been no ceasefire,” Sakhani added. “It is unbearable; there is no sign of normal life at all.”"

At 193cm (6ft 4in), the one-time Reform UK leader in Wales towered over colleagues and opponents – and he was taller still in his favourite cowboy boots. Other than that, the softly-spoken 52-year-old was a largely unremarkable presence among the more colourful characters in Nigel Farage’s parties. Until recently, political profiles have dwelt on Gill’s politically quirky status: the teetotal member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who bore Ukip’s flag in the Senedd, even if opponents charged that he was often absent. Yet his legacy is now a very different and disturbing one. This month he will be sentenced at the Old Bailey after pleading guilty to taking bribes to make statements in favour of Russia during his tenure as a member of the European parliament. In modern British politics, it is an almost unique fall from grace – perhaps with parallels to the story of John Stonehouse, the high-flying Labour MP recruited as a spy for Czech intelligence in the early 60s. But Gill’s humiliation isn’t just personal. His links to Russia raise awkward questions for Reform UK, and for its leader, Nigel Farage – Gill was a key lieutenant of his when they were both in Brussels. While Farage has been trying to distance himself from Gill, multiple sources who worked with them in Brussels have told the Guardian that the two men used to be close. The moment of Gill’s downfall dates back to July 2021 and the arrivals queue at Washington DC’s Dulles international airport. FBI agents stopped Oleg Voloshyn, a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician close to Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch sometimes known in his native country as the “dark prince” and a long-term ally and friend of Vladimir Putin. It was less than a year before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Medvedchuk had been charged with treason, and his TV channels, conduits for Russian propaganda, had been taken off the air. Voloshyn, his envoy to the west, was in the crosshairs of US authorities. The FBI extracted WhatsApp messages from Voloshyn’s phone in which he discussed secretly paying Gill. Voloshyn was released after three hours of questioning, but he and Medvedchuk were both named the following year by the US as agents of a Kremlin plot to install a puppet government in Ukraine. Now in Moscow, Voloshyn was Gill’s co-accused, albeit beyond the reach of British authorities. Two months later in September 2021, after the stop at Dulles airport, counter-terrorism police arrested Gill at Manchester airport. On his phone, police found messages that showed he had reached an agreement with Voloshyn. According to prosecutors, Gill accepted cash on at least eight occasions to make specific statements and opinions benefiting Russia. The amount has yet to be disclosed, but various amounts totalling in excess of at least £10,000 were mentioned in WhatApp messages between him and Voloshyn. Looking back on them now, the public statements appear subtle, but they provided the mood music in the west for a propaganda war being waged by the Kremlin to paint Ukraine’s pro-western leaders as repressive. For his cooperation in this covert PR campaign, Gill received “xmas presents” and “post cards” – coded references to money. They were his reward for making speeches in the European parliament and giving TV interviews scripted by Voloshyn. Speaking to the Guardian via email, Voloshyn denied allegations made by the US and UK that he had acted at the direction of Russia’s FSB spy agency. He insisted the payments – typically £4,000 or £5,000 each – were merely media appearance fees, rather than bribes. He described Gill as a “humble” father of five who was “definitely not rich” and was the “victim of a geopolitical conspiracy”. The tangled story of Gill and Voloshyn raises questions about how Russia has attempted to cultivate contacts across British political life. David Coburn and Jonathan Arnott, two other MEPs who were part of Farage’s Ukip bloc in Brussels, visited Ukraine with Gill on an October 2018 trip. During the visit, Coburn, Gill and Arnott appeared on camera in interviews with 112 Ukraine, a pro-Russian channel affiliated with Medvedchuk. Six weeks later, the three would make similar statements during a debate in the European parliament on 11 December that touched on press freedom in Ukraine and the question of whether it should be allowed to join the EU. Gill spoke first. While saying he had “every sympathy with Ukraine”, he added: “It is wrong to fight repression with repression.” Prosectors in Britain say he had received a script for the speech from Voloshyn on 7 December 2018. Arnott and Coburn followed, with the former calling on the Ukrainian government to ensure freedom of the press “against a backdrop of violence against journalists [and] the proposed closure of TV channels”. Coburn then accused Kyiv’s leaders of being “found wanting” on freedom of the press, accusing them of “plotting” to close the channel 112 Ukraine and questioning whether Ukraine was fit for EU membership. Gill and Coburn sat on the channel’s new “international” board, along Voloshyn and others. There is no suggestion that either Coburn or Arnott took bribes in the same way as Gill. Contacted by the Guardian, Arnott rejected any suggestion that he had links to Russia or was acting in its interests and pointed to another part of his speech in which he said “the best response to a loss of freedom is increased freedom”. He added: “I think that provides a bit of background and context to what I was saying in the speech and explains where I was coming from. Russia’s suppression of free speech should not be countered by Ukraine also suppressing free speech.” Attempts have been made to contact Coburn. In correspondence with the Guardian, Voloshyn claims the broadcaster 112 Ukraine “should have” covered the MEPs’ travel costs on their 2018 trip. In fact, declarations by the three to the European parliament record their tickets as having been paid for by the European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights, a front created by Russian intelligence agents with the same name as a genuine organisation. The cutout’s president, Janusz Niedźwiecki, was arrested in 2021 in his home country, Poland, on suspicion of espionage for Russia. Arnott said if he had been aware the money for his trip may have come from Russian assets “obviously I would not have participated in any visit on such a basis”. Farage has faced questions about the extent of contact he may have had with Voloshyn. Nadia Sass, Voloshyn’s wife, a 112 Ukraine journalist, last year posted a photo on X of herself with Farage, which appears to have been taken outside the European parliament in about 2018, saying she would “miss Nigel Farage and his team”. Another tweet included a picture of Farage holding a T-shirt with the logo “Leave and Let Die #brexit”, apparently taken in Gill’s Strasbourg office in 2018. Voloshyn said Sass had given it to Farage because she wanted to promote her political T-shirt business. He claims he has never spoken to Farage. A spokesperson said: “Nigel Farage meets thousands of people every single year. Many hundreds of them will ask to have a photo taken with him. He was deeply shocked and angered by the actions of Mr Gill and condemns them in every possible way.” They added that Farage did not have any knowledge of Gill’s “shameful activities”. But Niedźwiecki and Voloshyn appear to have also widened their net beyond the various incarnations of parties by Farage. Both were named in warning emails sent to all MPs at Westminster in July 2021 and January 2022 by the speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle. A number of MPs are understood to have come forward to the security services after Hoyle warned them that Voloshyn was working to gain the support of a number of politicians in parliament for policies in support of Russian state objectives. Sir John Whittingdale, a former minister and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Ukraine, said he had first come across Voloshyn when he was “the right hand man” to Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, who served as Ukraine’s foreign minister under its Moscow-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych. “I went to observe an election around 2012 and I did see him once at his request in Westminster [in 2018] with Nadia Sass [Voloshyn’s wife]. As I recall they were complaining about restrictions and harassment of her TV channel by the government,” Whittingdale told the Guardian. “He has now been identified as a Russian asset, though at the time I knew him he was working for the [previous] Ukrainian government, which was quite pro-Russian.” There is no indication that Whittingdale or other Tory MPs such as Mark Pritchard, who was due to appear on a panel at an event in London with Sass, were compromised by any association with him. Instead, the heaviest price is expected to be paid by Gill, whose guilty plea in September to eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019 took prosecutors by surprise. An ashen-faced Gill had entered the plea after earlier appearances at Westminster magistrates court, where he had been ordered to surrender his passport and register with police at Anglesey, the Welsh island where he lives with his wife and children. Before entering politics, he had practised in Anglesey for six years as a Mormon bishop. Anglesey had also been the base for an earlier business running care home services founded by his family and operating mainly in Hull. That business collapsed with debts of £116,000 after the 2008 financial crisis hit. Attempts to build a political career followed, with early failures at gaining election at council and devolved level before finally becoming a Ukip MEP in 2014. From the misery of a struggling business and electoral failure, Gill found himself at the centre of Brussels politics, rubbing shoulders with the eclectic milieu of international visitors and lobbyists at the European parliament. A hitherto unnoticed interest in international affairs bloomed. Farage has been trying to distance himself from Gill, telling the BBC that he was “stunned” when he found out his party’s former leader in Wales took bribes. Challenged on whether he questioned Gill over the statements, Farage said: “I didn’t know anything about it; all I knew was that he’d been to Ukraine. I told him not to go, he defied me and went, I was completely unaware of any statements that he made.” However, multiple sources who worked with Farage and Gill in Brussels and Strasbourg said the two men had been close. Gill was described variously as Farage’s “enforcer” and “right-hand man” by some who recalled they had adjoining offices. One former Ukip MEP from that time told the Guardian: “Gill was in the thick of organising. He was the right-hand version of Farage. His office was right beside Farage’s.” “Nathan had a unique place in the party,” another source said. “He was the centre of gravity in Wales, and David [Coburn] was at the centre in Scotland. I found David quite difficult – he could be very outspoken. He was very loyal to Nigel.” Gill also had personal vulnerabilities of the sort foreign intelligence agencies look to seize upon. Alex Phillips, formerly a media adviser to Gill and someone who also served alongside him as a Brexit party MEP, said: “There is a tragic backdrop to this. They clearly targeted someone who was financially vulnerable.” Phillips told the Guardian she was “as shocked as everyone” when Gill was arrested, adding that she voluntarily went to speak to the Metropolitan police and let them know that she had known nothing about his secret activities. “I don’t believe he was cunning enough to really believe in what he became involved in. It’s quite sad really.”"

Australian TV broadcasters are already subject to content quotas which mean that at least 55% of the content they broadcast between 6am and midnight must be Australian. Prior to 2020, they also had sub-quotas for children’s shows, drama and documentary programs. However, these sub-quotas were removed in 2020 when the Coalition government introduced a point system instead to allow more flexibility for commercial broadcasters. The result, as shown in this chart based on data from Screen Australia, is that children’s TV production hit an all-time low of just 35 hours of content in the 2023-24 financial year: Almost all Australian children’s TV content is now produced by the ABC. Now, according to the government, new quotas will apply to streaming services “with more than one million Australian subscribers”, who will need to “invest at least 10% of their total expenditure for Australia – on new local drama, children’s, documentary, arts and educational programs”."
news_ng-interactive_2025_nov_08_how-the-celebrity-traitors-reversed-tvs-most-troubling-trend.txt,news,2025-11-08,Michael Savage Media editor,How The Celebrity Traitors reversed TV’s most troubling trend,https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/08/how-the-celebrity-traitors-reversed-tvs-most-troubling-trend,"There are not many plaudits left for The Celebrity Traitors, which has delivered tension, crowd-pleasing ineptitude and the most famous fart in television history. Yet for all the show’s achievements, one in particular – a feat that TV executives across the globe have been desperate to deliver – may stand out as the most impressive: it has got gen Z watching live TV. There has long been fretting that viewers under the age of 25 have moved away from watching once-dominant linear television, lost to the algorithmic fix of digital platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. Yet the treachery of the turret appears to have dragged them back to the TV. The overnight ratings for The Celebrity Traitors – which measures the number of people watching live or later that evening on iPlayer reveal that more than half of the people aged between 16 and 24 viewing the show within that time slot watched every episode of The Celebrity Traitors as it was broadcast. The show’s finale broke records. Its overnight average audience was more than 11 million, the biggest of the year and the biggest since the Gavin &amp; Stacey special on Christmas Day. It was watched by 81% of the viewers aged 16-24 who were watching linear TV in that time slot, according to Digital i. “At a time when younger audiences are increasingly turning away from live linear TV, The Traitors has grown into appointment viewing for 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK,” said Matt Ross, Digital i’s chief analytics officer. “The most recent iteration has been a major draw for younger viewers.” The race is now on to dissect that success and see what lessons can be taken from the show – or whether its mass appeal and ability to reach younger viewers is simply an increasingly rare anomaly. Katy Fox, executive producer at Studio Lambert, which makes the show for the BBC, said: “The idea of the whole family stopping what they’re doing and sitting round the telly to share in a hugely positive, joyous show is exactly what you hope for as producers. “The best thing about the 16- to 24-year-olds taking to Traitors so faithfully is just the sheer amount of energy and creativity they bring to fandom – from memes to videos to Halloween costumes and everything in between – it’s fantastic.” The show’s success is timely for the BBC after concerns were raised about its long-term appeal to gen Z. Just this week, Jordan Schwarzenberger, the manager of the hugely successful YouTube collective the Sidemen, said the corporation risked becoming culturally irrelevant to young audiences. Industry insiders say there are plenty of lessons to be learned from The Celebrity Traitors. They point to its “always on” appeal, with the live show acting almost like a live sports event, with an official podcast, numerous clipped moments and an embrace of fan-made memes and content meaning there is always Traitors-related material to consume during the week. Kate Phillips, the BBC’s chief content officer who first commissioned the programme, said her initial interest in the show was born out of the pandemic, when she felt the need to find shows that brought people together. Since then, she says the show, which began as a Dutch format, grew rapidly by word of mouth across the generations – a key measure for the BBC, tasked with providing content with mass appeal. “What I want is shows that have the 3Gs at their heart,” she said. “By that, I mean shows that have three generations of people all watching together. One thing I’ve taken away is that, actually, young people really love to watch with their parents, with their grandparents. People really appreciate it.” As for why the show had reached younger viewers, she pointed to partnerships with TikTok, linking the platform directly with iPlayer. She also says the show’s social strategy was “built with the under-35s, and particularly the under-24s, firmly in mind”. The show has been endlessly clipped, while the BBC has also been relaxed about fans jumping in and making their own viral content. Phillips said for all the talk of linear TV’s declining importance, The Celebrity Traitors also demonstrated how the medium could still play a critical role as a “shop window” for the best content. “Celebrity Traitors can be on linear TV, but it evolves into a cross-platform, shared experience that feels very current, very fun and very unfiltered,” she said. “The memes and the comments – it’s like a kind of second entertainment show running alongside the main show.” Jon Willers, a media consultant who has been thinking about how to reach gen Z, said the show’s success pointed to the industry’s need to reinvent and reskill itself for the social media age. “It’s one of those few shows that bridges two different worlds,” he said. “There’s a digital world, which skews younger and it’s more about socials and less about watching traditional telly. Then you’ve got the traditional world, which is about seeing what’s on at 9pm. “There are very few instances at the moment where a show can kind of penetrate both of those places. There needs to be more shows that have that vision and that ambition. It shows that people aren’t necessarily leaving TV. They’re leaving TV that doesn’t really speak to them. “We’ve all been very siloed up to this point. TV producers make TV programmes. Social creators make content on socials. Broadcasters are essentially the publishers and help with marketing. TV producers are now trying to be much more multi-platform.” In fact, The Celebrity Traitors is not the only big hit to find an audience with gen Z, as traditional broadcasters attempt to adapt to the different ways in which they find and dissect their chosen shows. The prime example is Dancing With the Stars, the US version of Strictly Come Dancing. It was once on a par with other reality formats, but has now found itself as the dominant title in the genre. It did so by embracing online culture by using viral songs, bringing in dancers with a big social media presence and broadening the cast. “Dancing With the Stars leaned heavily into the creator ecosystem – casting creators as contestants,” said Evan Shapiro, a Hollywood producer turned leading analyst on the creator economy. “It obviously paid off,” he added. “Celebrity Traitors collected a truly fascinating cross-section of entertainment culture in the UK and then leaned heavily into creator ethos – clipping the show ad nauseam, encouraging user-generated content.” He said it was proof that big broadcasters and titles could adapt to changing consumption. “The mindset of successful crossover IP [from TV to social media] is ‘the show is the clip and the clip is the show – and together they are the show’. It’s all proof that when big publishers act like creators, they can be dominant creators themselves.” For The Celebrity Traitors, its makers say casting was crucial and included the likes of Niko Omilana, who has more than 8 million subscribers on YouTube, though he left the game early on. “We’ve always believed that The Traitors is a format that can appeal to every generation, and have always tried to reflect that in our casting,” said Fox. “Having a celebrity cast with a broad range of ages and personalities meant we were confident younger viewers would identify with cast members they already know … and maybe even get to know national treasures they didn’t! We’re delighted with the results.” For others in the industry, the discussion about how to keep younger audiences tuned in is complicating a simple equation. In show business, the golden rule still stands – it is all about hits. Peter Fincham, co-CEO of the production company Expectation and co-hosts the podcast Insiders TV, said: “The most powerful form of marketing is always going to be word of mouth. It’s in the conversation at home, at work, at school. “When that happens, you get young people watching. What is maybe a little bit more unusual in the modern age is what you would call an old-fashioned, mainstream hit that gets everybody talking. “I’m quite wary of the trend analysis. This is the simplest thing in the world. Have a great big hit and you will get a lot of people viewing it of all ages. That was true 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago.”"
news_ng-interactive_2025_nov_09_amid-squabbles-bombast-and-competing-interests-what-can-cop30-achieve.txt,news,2025-11-09,Fiona Harvey environment editor,"Amid squabbles, bombast and competing interests, what can Cop30 achieve?",https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/09/amid-squabbles-bombast-and-competing-interests-what-can-cop30-achieve,"“It broke my heart.” Surangel Whipps, president of the tiny Pacific nation of Palau, was sitting in the front row of the UN’s general assembly in New York when Donald Trump made a long and rambling speech, his first to the UN since his re-election, on 23 September. Whipps was prepared for fury and bombast from the US president, but what followed was shocking. Trump’s rant on the climate crisis – a “green scam”, “the greatest con job ever perpetrated”, “predictions made by stupid people” – was an unprecedented attack on science and global action from a major world leader. Palau, threatened by rising sea levels, floods and more intense storms, is home to nearly 20,000 people, all likely to be made refugees if global heating surpasses 1.5C for a prolonged period, a likelihood they are desperate to prevent. They know they are just the beginning, the frontline. Globally, hundreds of millions of people’s homes and livelihoods will be destroyed by climate breakdown within decades. “Our children need hope, they need to be inspired,” says Whipps. “They need to see us coming together to solve problems.” What they got instead was a tirade, disbelief and discouragement. The populist tide Whipps’s dismay is felt by vulnerable countries around the world. After years in which it appeared the world was beginning to act on the climate crisis, a populist tide has swept in, turning back or threatening progress in many democracies. Trump’s words were just the most extreme expression of a global rightwing trend. In the EU, hard-right political groupings delayed key decisions on emissions targets, and are seeking further abandonment of climate action. The UK’s poll-topping Reform party openly embraces denial. In Argentina, Trump ally Javier Milei has taken his chainsaw to climate policy as well as the economy. Yet polls find an overwhelming majority of people – 89% globally – are concerned about the climate crisis and want action. And there have been unexpected victories for pro-climate politicians: Mark Carney in Canada, Anthony Albanese in Australia, and Claudia Sheinbaum – a climate scientist – in Mexico. This week, those powerful geopolitical forces will clash in the small Amazonian city of Belém. The UN climate summit, Cop30, begins on Monday, with a packed schedule for the Brazilian hosts – 145 agenda items to be decided over two weeks, ranging from questions of cutting greenhouse gases, financial help for poor countries, the rights of Indigenous peoples, boosting clean energy and preserving the world’s forests. Squabbles among nations, bombast and competing national interests are only part of the story. Nature is giving its own account. Outside the air-conditioned conference halls, temperatures are rising fast, and for two years have breached the relatively safe limit of 1.5C above preindustrial levels that nations had vowed to keep. The evidence of climate breakdown is gathering fast: the record-breaking Hurricane Melissa that devastated Jamaica last month, temperatures climbing above 50C in the Middle East, and ocean temperatures soaring. Scientists have warned that the first of a series of “tipping points” – the bleaching of ocean corals – already appears to have been reached. At the heart of Cop30 will be two key questions: what can the world do to stop global heating accelerating further and faster? And can it be done in time to prevent unstoppable catastrophe? ‘Belém is the test’ Brazil’s presidency of Cop30, the 30th “conference of the parties” under the UN framework convention on climate change since it was signed at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, is focused on the developing world, and the host’s top priority is to try to preserve unity amid stark global divisions. This is being called by some the most consequential Cop since the Paris agreement was signed 10 years ago. At Paris, countries set out national targets on curbing or cutting greenhouse gas emissions, but they were insufficient to hold to the 1.5C limit that the treaty stipulated. Six years later, at Cop26 in Glasgow a fresh round of pledges cut projected temperature rises further but only to about 2.7C. At this Cop nations will need to revise their targets again – but with temperatures climbing faster than expected, those revisions have to be urgent and deep. “The Paris agreement is our mandate; Belém is the test,” says Ban Ki-moon, who was UN secretary general at the time of the Paris summit. “In a fractured world, the Paris agreement remains the one pact that shows humanity can act as one – but it needs resuscitation through action, not rhetoric. Do this, and the Paris agreement becomes a living plan that protects people and strengthens economies. If we fall short, we risk placing both its promise – and the people it was written to protect – in jeopardy.” To ease the negotiations, world leaders were invited to Belém this week, meeting on Thursday and Friday to galvanise their ministers and officials before the official start. Trump, of course, was not among them. Nor was Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine poured hundreds of billions in windfall profits into the coffers of the fossil fuel industry, which invested it in more fossil fuels. Xi Jinping of China also did not go but took part virtually in lead-up meetings, at which he promised further action to shift China to a green economy. India, too, has made encouraging signals: although the country’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, skipped the summit, he visited Brasília in July, and the harsh end to last year’s Cop – when India’s negotiators refused to accept what they regarded as an inadequate pledge of $300bn (£230bn) in climate finance from the rich world – may be avoided this time. Saudi Arabia, Russia and a few allies have a history of obstructing Cops, and Argentina may join them. There will be fights, and possible wrecking tactics. A yawning ‘emissions gap’ The best way for pro-climate countries to stave off this threat would be to come up with strong national plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions. But, except in a few cases, this has not happened. Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are the bedrock of the Paris agreement. They set out how far, how fast, and by what means, countries will curb or cut carbon, in line with the goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. At the time of writing, about 100 countries had submitted their NDCs, though the official deadline passed in February. China and the EU only submitted their NDCs a few days before the start of the conference. Taken together, the NDCs received so far would achieve only a sixth of the emissions cuts needed to hold to the 1.5C goal, according to UN estimates. Brazil has been reluctant to address the inadequacy of the NDCs. The presidency team has insisted they are not a formal part of the Cop30 mandate, as they are up to individual nations to draw up. It was only after protests that space was created within the agenda even to discuss NDCs, and it is still unclear whether there will be an outcome that mandates clear steps to fill the yawning “emissions gap” between what has been pledged and what is needed. Brazil says it wants to focus on “implementation”, rather than words in windowless negotiating rooms. And in some respects, climate action is – in some regions and some sectors – flourishing in ways that were scarcely imagined possible even a decade ago. Renewables, led by solar and wind, accounted for more than 90% of new power capacity added worldwide last year, with solar now the cheapest electricity in history. Global clean-energy investment is expected to reach $2.2tn this year, which would be about twice fossil-fuel spending. Last year, one in five of new cars sold around the world was electric, and there are now more jobs in clean energy than in fossil fuels. That sort of real-world action is what makes a difference to people – it gets climate action out from the negotiating rooms, and the corporate boardrooms, and into living rooms, in the words of the UN climate chief, Simon Stiell. Demands of the global south Brazil is also acutely conscious that developing countries will judge this Cop on how far it helps them attain their key goals: financial assistance to help them adapt to the impacts of climate breakdown, and investment in their economies to shift to clean energy. “We need a fair deal,” says Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank. “These are not acts of charity – they are investments in a stable, livable planet. We need to see the sharing of clean energy technology by the global north with the global south.” Finance was the key issue at last year’s Cop, but the deal reached there left a bitter taste with many poor countries. Cop29 agreed a goal of ensuring that $1.3tn a year should flow to the developing world by 2035, but rich countries agreed to provide only $300bn of that, leaving the rest to come from the private sector and revenue-raising mechanisms such as the levy on shipping (now postponed) and a charge on frequent flyers, as well as the carbon markets and philanthropy. But without the US, even the paltry $300bn pledge of the developed world last year looks harder to achieve. Cooperation among countries in the global south – which could include China, and some of the middle-income countries that have already started on a greener path – will also be key. Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of an Indian thinktank, the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, and a special envoy to the Cop30 presidency, said: “We are all under collective siege and when you’re under siege, the more you hunker down together, the better chances you have to survive the real and metaphorical hurricanes coming at us.” World leaders who jetted in over the Amazon rainforest, its green vastness scarred and pockmarked by widespread logging, ranches and small individual farm clearings, are in no doubt as to Brazil’s key demand from them: to sign up to the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF). For the presidency, this will be the single most important achievement of Cop30: a fund that will be used to keep existing forests standing. Brazil wants to gather pledges of $25bn for the TFFF initially, using this to attract a further $100bn from the global financial markets. The money would be dispensed to forested regions, rewarding them for reducing deforestation and providing finance for biodiversity conservation work. But the subject the hosts seem much less comfortable with is the root cause of the climate crisis: fossil fuels. At Cop28 in Dubai in 2023, a historic resolution was made – that the world must “transition away from fossil fuels”. It may seem astonishing that this was the first time in 30 years of talks the subject had been addressed directly – the intransigence of petrostates and the need for consensus within the UN process had prevented such a move before. As soon as it was over, fellow petrostates – chiefly Saudi Arabia – began to try to unpick the agreement. At Cop29 in Azerbaijan – another economy heavily dependent on exporting oil and gas – attempts to reaffirm the resolution were stymied. Supporters want to pick up the fight again this year, though about 50 countries are thought to want to prevent it being discussed. Brazil ranks in the top 10 global oil and gas exporters, and is prospecting for new fields, some of them offshore from the Amazon. The country’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has strongly defended the rights of poor countries to carry on exploiting their resources, arguing it is the rich countries that have benefited from them for two centuries, and caused the climate crisis, who must stop. For the next fortnight, Brazil’s role is to facilitate this debate, and the host’s decisions on how to handle the issue will be crucial. A just transition “It undermines the credibility of Cop if Cop can’t deal with fossil fuels,” says Leo Roberts at the E3G thinktank. If there is such a discussion, it can only take place in the context of a global “just transition”, argue civil society groups. That means ensuring that workers, the poor and the vulnerable are not abandoned or exploited in the race to clean energy. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, acknowledged the problem in July, saying: “The critical minerals that power the clean energy revolution are often found in countries that have long been exploited. And today, we see history repeating. Communities mistreated. Rights trampled. Environments trashed. Nations stuck at the bottom of value chains while others reap rewards. And extractive models digging deeper holes of inequality and harm. This must end.” China controls the majority of the world’s critical mineral supply chain, but the US is keen to expand its share. Neither has historically been keen on UN initiatives that impose fresh rules on their markets, but Lula has long been a strong proponent of workers’ rights. With fights over the agenda inevitable, coupled with the lack of trust between rich and poor nations, and the potential for threats from the US and its allies, Brazil may count it a victory if the Cop proceeds without major disruption. Democracy in Brazil, as in many countries riven by populist politicians and suffering economic hardship, is in a fragile state – simply holding things together is hard enough. But the poor and vulnerable around the world need and deserve much more, says Meena Raman, head of programmes at the Third World Network. Future promises of better behaviour will not be sufficient to safeguard them. They need action now, finance now, and a clear plan for sticking as close as possible to 1.5C. “It is no longer sufficient to merely invoke the need to save multilateralism,” she warns. “We must deliver on saving the planet and protecting the world’s most vulnerable. What is needed now is bold, accountable action that prioritises justice, equity and survival.” • This article was amended on 9 November 2025. An earlier version said fewer than 90 countries had submitted their NDCs before Cop30; in fact, about 100 have now submitted them."
news_ng-interactive_2025_nov_15_the-climate-crisis-is-expensive-net-zero-is-cheaper-for-australia-than-not-doing-more.txt,news,2025-11-14,Nick Evershed,The climate crisis is expensive: net zero is cheaper for Australia than not doing more,https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/15/the-climate-crisis-is-expensive-net-zero-is-cheaper-for-australia-than-not-doing-more,"One of the justifications the Liberal and National parties have made for abandoning the target of net zero by 2050 is that the policy will cost too much. For example, the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, erroneously said: “The cost of net zero by 2050 will be $9tn … That will put things like Medicare and NDIS at risk.” On Wednesday, the Liberal senator Leah Blyth said: “I don’t think that we can be stewards of the environment if we can’t afford it.” However, looking only at the cost of the transition to net zero emissions by 2050 ignores how much it will cost the Australian economy if we – and the world – don’t make the changes required to meaningfully address climate change. That is to say, how does the cost of net zero compare to the cost of a scenario where we don’t take any more action on climate change, or delay the net zero transition? Various groups have conducted modelling to answer this question, and at least three recent analyses have found that it is far cheaper for Australia, and the world, to make a well-coordinated effort to reach net zero by 2050: The chart above shows the results of modelling by Ortec Finance. They found that if climate change is not sufficiently addressed, Australia’s GDP would be 9% lower than it would otherwise be in 2050. This would amount to a difference of several hundred billion dollars. Even a delayed net zero response, where global governments are slower on implementing policies but then take swift action on emissions to meet the 2050 deadline, will cost more than the alternative – an orderly transition to net zero. The Ortec Finance report is not an outlier, either. A Treasury report in September analysed three different net zero scenarios, and concluded that “clear and credible climate action will lead to more jobs, higher wages and better living standards for Australians” and “a disorderly transition would mean fewer jobs, less business investment, lower wages, lower living standards and higher power prices in a smaller economy”. Elsewhere, modelling from the Investor Group on Climate Change found that global policies as at 2024, which would result in 3C of warming, would mean a $656bn hit to Australia’s GDP by 2050. In an alternative scenario, in which Australia and other countries make an orderly transition to net zero, Australia’s economy would be $590bn better off than the 3C warming scenario."
news_ng-interactive_2025_nov_23_trump-lavish-saudi-courtship-leaves-israel-on-backfoot.txt,news,2025-11-23,Julian Borger Senior international correspondent,Why Trump’s lavish Saudi courtship leaves Israel on the back foot,https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/23/trump-lavish-saudi-courtship-leaves-israel-on-backfoot,"The White House welcome bestowed on the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was the most lavish of the Trump presidency, and a gaudily clear statement of its foreign policy priorities. It was billed as a mere working visit, but it was more extravagant than any previous state visit. The president greeted the prince on the south lawn, the White House’s biggest stage. There were uniformed men on horses bearing flags and a flypast of fighter jets. Once inside the newly gilded Oval Office, Trump came across as a man besotted. He grabbed at the prince’s hand and declared more than once what an honour it was to lay claim to the royal friendship. When a journalist pierced this golden bubble by raising the 2018 murder and dismemberment of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi – the main reason Prince Mohammed had not visited for seven years – Trump lashed out, lambasting the reporter and her network, ABC. He declared that Khashoggi was “extremely controversial” and not universally liked (as if those were grounds for being butchered) and insisted the prince had known nothing about the murder in Istanbul by Saudi state operatives, in direct contradiction of the conclusions drawn by US intelligence. Trump’s disregard for human rights and US intelligence agencies and his blatant fandom for autocrats are nothing new. US foreign policy had already shifted decisively in that direction in January, as soon as he took office for the second time. If there was a real shift on show during Prince Mohammed’s visit on Tuesday, it was in the skies over Washington. The F-35 stealth fighter jets on show in the flypast for the visiting royal are up for sale to Saudi Arabia, Trump confirmed. The sale would not be conditional and the specifications of Saudi F-35s would be the same as Israel’s. If the deal goes forward, it will cut against one of the abiding principles of US-Israeli relations – that Israel always gets to buy the best military hardware, giving it a prized “qualitative edge” over other US allies in the region. Appearing to dump that principle, Trump made clear that both countries would get the best as they are equally close to Washington. “[Saudi Arabia] is a great ally and Israel’s a great ally,” the president said. “As far as I’m concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line.” That is not language that Israel likes to hear out of Washington and it was the latest of several setbacks in the bilateral relationship in recent months. Potentially of equal importance to the F35 sale, the administration has announced it would lift the ban on selling advanced AI chips to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The decision significantly boosts Riyadh’s ambitions of becoming a global tech hub with vast energy-intensive datacentres that will be the foundations of the global AI economy in which Saudi Arabia and the US could take a lead together. Gregory Gause, a visiting scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington, compared the ambitions of a US-Saudi partnership in the AI economy with the US corporate-led development of Saudi oilfields in the 1930s. “It could be a real solid link between the countries – a better guarantee of an American commitment to Saudi security than anything that could be written on a piece of paper,” Gause said. There were other recent events which suggested at least a temporary US move away from Israeli primacy in Middle East policy. On Monday, a US-drafted UN security council resolution included language about a possible pathway to an independent Palestine, despite desperate Israeli efforts to have the clause removed. A few months earlier, at the end of June, Trump lifted some sanctions on Syria, again in conflict with Israeli preferences. And in May he toured the Middle East to showcase his foreign policy, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, but not Israel. All this marks a drift in US Middle East policy from what was arguably the high point in the US-Israeli relationship, when Trump fulfilled Benjamin Netanyahu’s longstanding aim and joined Israel in airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities in June, triggering anxiety across the Gulf. “Saudi leaders were alarmed at how quickly the conflict threatened to spill across the region,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and north Africa programme at the Chatham House foreign policy thinktank. “Although a fragile ceasefire holds for now, Riyadh remains wary that another confrontation could erupt with little warning.” In the wake of the Iran strikes, Netanyahu seems to have taken Washington’s backing for granted and overreached, bombing a target in the Qatari capital, Doha, in a bid to kill Hamas officials. Trump reportedly had very little notice of the plan to bomb a close regional ally. Trump reacted by humiliating Netanyahu during his visit to the White House in late September, forcing him to call his Qatari counterpart from the Oval Office in order to apologise. In Trump’s transactional White House, it is hard for Israel to compete against the Gulf. Prince Mohammed promised $1tn in Saudi investment in the US economy. Qatar has given Trump a $400m luxury plane to use as a new Air Force One. The flow of huge amounts of money occurs in both public and private spheres. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE have together invested near $5bn in a fund managed by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump has consistently shown he has a greater affinity with absolute rulers than elected leaders. Prince Mohammed faces none of the constraints that trouble Netanyahu as he struggles to keep his coalition together. Prince Mohammed also consistently makes clear if the US disappoints, his kingdom will go to China for the hardware and security guarantees it needs. The fear that Saudi Arabia might be “lost” to China dates back to the previous administration. It contributed to a reversal in former president Joe Biden’s position on Prince Mohammed, from “pariah” for the slaughter of Khashoggi, to a humiliating climbdown, a visit to Jeddah in July 2022, and a notorious fist bump with the prince. Some observers argue that the wind-shifts of the past few months do not add up to a US “reset” in the Middle East policy. They point out that, beneath the razzle-dazzle of the Saudi visit, there are aspects of the discussion that are more superficial than they initially seemed. Announcing the $1tn investment promise, Prince Mohammed did not mention a timescale. Nor is it clear how many F-35 the US will sell to Riyadh. Several items on the summit agenda do not look as if they are coming to fruition any time soon, like a bilateral defence pact and a civil nuclear power agreement, which can be blocked by Congress. The prospect of Saudi normalisation of relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords came up but was politely shelved by the crown prince. He made clear that normalisation would depend on a solid commitment to a Palestinian state, considerably more than the vague, conditional language in Monday’s security council resolution. When it comes to Gaza and Palestine as a whole, Daniel Levy, the president of the US/Middle East Project and an analyst of the region, sees very little prospect of change. “On the Palestinian file, there’s no joy at all, I would argue,” Levy said. “I think Israel has a very free hand. They’ve got the hostages out, and they’re still bombing Gaza.” But in the bigger picture, he argued that when it comes to US policy in the Middle East, the more it changes, the more it stays the same. “If you just strip away some of the particular stupidity of the Biden administration and add the familial self-interest of the Trump administration, and throw into the mix reactions to events and some of the excesses of Israeli overreach, I don’t think we’re seeing a fundamental reset,” Levy added. US policy over the years has not essentially changed, he argued. “It is policy primarily driven by people with a very shallow understanding of the region essentially taking their cues from Israel and a smattering of rulers in the region.”"

The Rothermere family, however, takes a more relaxed approach to time. While most business boards draw up five-year plans, the Rothermeres, having compiled a feared media empire over more than a century, are used to thinking in terms of generations. It was in the summer of 2004 that Jonathan Harold Esmond Vere Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere, the tall, curly haired and immaculately turned out proprietor of the Daily Mail, failed in his bid to acquire the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph. By Rothermere’s assessment, the failure delighted Rupert Murdoch because it would have created a stable of rightwing newspapers powerful enough to rival the “unique political leverage” of Murdoch’s own titles, then comprising the Times, Sunday Times, the Sun and News of the World. The softly spoken Rothermere, however, was able to play a longer game. The Telegraph titles were again put up for sale in 2023. Since then, two prospective owners have come and gone, both after internal Telegraph revolts over their suitability. Rothermere has now swooped. In the process, the 57-year-old has reaffirmed his family’s obsession with British newspapers, after his forebears bought, sold and smashed together some of the biggest titles of their day. “Lord Rothermere has got a business head, but he’s not sharply business minded,” said Alex DeGroote, a media analyst who has previously worked closely with Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT). “This sounds a bit cheesy, but he’s genuinely passionate about journalism. I suspect internally, they’ve wanted to unite media businesses that serve centre-right audiences for decades.” Huge issues remain before the hereditary peer’s DMGT group can clinch the titles. Alongside the competition and media plurality concerns, Telegraph insiders are asking how he will stump up the £500m valuation. However, Rothermere’s hopes of creating a conservative media powerhouse have been rekindled. It was a bold bid for a proprietor who prides himself on staying behind the scenes, often noting his willingness to let the pugnacious and often brutal views of the Daily Mail contradict his own gentler, more pro-European conservatism. With the Rothermeres, however, media acquisitions are a family affair. A portrait of Alfred Harmsworth, his great-great-uncle who founded the Daily Mail in 1896, dominates Rothermere’s office. One of his earliest memories was of his father, Vere, taking him to the hot-metal newspaper presses. A young Jonathan would be included in conversations about the difficult start for the Mail on Sunday in 1982. He remembers the stress of the vicious battle in 1987 between the London Daily News and his family’s Evening Standard, which he later sold. Rothermere himself flirted with journalism, working as a subeditor and reporter on the Sunday Mail in Scotland, before concentrating on the business side of his family’s group. When his father died of a heart attack in 1998, Rothermere is said to have had about 20 minutes upon returning home from the hospital before company calls began, in effect starting his chairing of DMGT, aged 30. He has previously sold off profitable parts of the business to refocus on the Mail and other newspaper assets. The Telegraph bid is the latest sign of his keenness to reaffirm the family’s media stronghold. “This is a 20-year plus target acquisition,” said a former DMGT executive. “He doesn’t want the Mail as the only newspaper asset he leaves for his son Vere.” Rothermere’s decision to take DMGT private in 2021 has also made the Telegraph pursuit easier. “I don’t have to justify myself to anybody,” he said shortly after the decision. The long pursuit of the Telegraph does not change the fact that the Mail will always be his first love. Favoured figures from the title are invited to his country estate. “He’s a Mail man, through and through,” said an acquaintance. So what does this Mail man want with the Telegraph, whose rightwing politics have, to some critics, increasingly become even more astringent than those of the Mail? Radical surgery is not on the cards in the short term. “I would not have turned it tabloid,” Rothermere said, in a rare public reflection on his failed 2004 purchase. “The Telegraph is not the Daily Mail.” He is targeting growth for both titles in the US, where the Wall Street Journal is relatively unopposed as a national title on the centre right. He also believes the Mail, still primarily driven by advertising and the newsstand, can learn from the Telegraph’s more subscription-based model. In fact, the family’s involvement in the Telegraph has already begun; Rothermere’s daughter is a business reporter at the title. It also hosts an extended Daily Mail family. Chris Evans, the Telegraph’s editor, is a former Mail executive. He is one of a series of editors across the British media who learned at the knee of Paul Dacre, the uncompromising former Mail editor who worked with Rothermere and his father. Intervening to change the Telegraph’s politics would be out of character. Dacre, still editor-in-chief at DMG Media, told the Guardian that neither Rothermere nor his father interfered editorially. “That is the main reason why I turned down very enticing offers to edit the Times and the Telegraph,” he said. “Frankly, I simply didn’t believe that Rupert Murdoch or [the former Telegraph proprietor] Conrad Black would give me that freedom. It’s difficult to overstate how valuable that freedom is to an editor. “Fleet Street is littered with the corpses of sacked editors who, amid crashing circulations, tried to please their proprietors rather than their readers. The Rothermeres have always understood that. It’s a sacred principle for them that editors are given total editorial autonomy, with the brutally clear understanding that they are dismissed if they produce poor papers.” Dacre said the hands-off approach came at a cost for Rothermere. “It’s no secret that his own political views were, and are, sometimes at odds with the Mail’s,” he said. “Columnists, news stories, diary items and the paper’s sometimes controversial editorial position would not infrequently cause him embarrassment with his friends and social circle. He never once complained and I cannot tell you how much I admired such fortitude. “Despite this, he has always enjoyed the company of journalists and counts some as friends. And, yes, he has this extraordinary passion for newspapers which I believe you need if you want to own them because they are irrational beasts that defy normal business logic. “After the launches of the Mail on Sunday, Metro and MailOnline, the Rothermeres lost countless millions over many years before turning a shilling. And of course, the company lost eye-watering sums on the Standard before reluctantly selling it.” Another former national newspaper editor was more cynical: “It’s easy not to interfere with the editor if you largely agree with what they put out,” they said. Rothermere’s light touch approach is perhaps again informed by family history. They have been dogged by criticism over his great-grandfather’s support for fascism and Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirts movement in the pages of the Daily Mail in the 1930s. As for who would edit the Telegraph under his ownership, Rothermere has explicitly praised Evans in a statement on the Telegraph takeover. While that may signal Evans is a sure thing to stay in post, it is also an understandable gesture, given that the guns of the Telegraph’s newsroom have been turned on previous suitors. With British politics seemingly sliding to the right, there are inevitable political concerns about uniting the Mail and Telegraph at a time when both have been boosting coverage of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party. Many liberal politicians believe the Mail’s abrasive style has become even starker in recent times, pointing to its championing of talking points pushed by Farage on immigration and the “woke” agenda. Some believe the Telegraph has undergone an even more radical shift, often running radical-right opinion pieces that go beyond those of the Mail. Tim Walker, a former Telegraph diarist, contrasted its current guise with the staid, establishment-friendly paper overseen by the editor Bill Deedes in the 1970s and 80s. “The Telegraph is now less interested in news and more interested in comment,” he said. “It’s become a very shouty paper. Perhaps Dacre, as a news man, might change that.” Senior Labour figures are concerned, along with the Liberal Democrats. “Concentrating so much agenda-setting power in the hands of so few would set a deeply concerning precedent,” said Anna Sabine, the Lib Dem culture spokesperson. The former Conservative cabinet minister David Davis is also opposed. Dacre argued that Rothermere’s papers were already more diverse than most realise. “Remember, the Standard’s readers were upmarket, liberal and metropolitan and espoused views that were diametrically opposed to the Daily Mail’s,” he said. “For their part, the Mail and Mail on Sunday backed different sides in the Brexit referendum. The Metro was deliberately designed to be apolitical in order to appeal to the young and the i Paper, whose editorial budget was increased by Jonathan after he bought it, couldn’t be more different from the Mail. “Today, the British media landscape is unrecognisable from a decade ago. British journalism is in a sad and parlous state. The regional and local press is dying. Several Fleet Street papers are a shadow of what they were. And it’s my hope, indeed my prayer, that the regulators now understand and recognise this.” There are numerous questions about how someone even with Rothermere’s resources has the cash. Most media analysts believe that a more representative price tag for the titles is in the region of £350m, but Rothermere is willing to pay a premium. DMGT does not have a ready £500m, the price apparently insisted upon by RedBird IMI as it seeks to recoup the loan that gained it control of the titles two years ago. Rothermere’s previous potential bid for the Telegraph in 2023 involved backers from Qatar. He has developed links in the Middle East, where his events business is performing strongly. In May, he was spotted among delegates with Donald Trump on a visit to Doha. However, his company has said there will be “no foreign state investment or capital” in the deal, to head off any potential investigation ordered by the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, under the new laws limiting foreign state ownership. It is understood the plan is to own the Telegraph outright, rather than lead a consortium. Telegraph staff have numerous other questions. Will RedBird, the fund involved in previous bids, have a role? Will loans lined up for those bids be deployed? Is Rothermere actually paying £500m? Waiting 20 years has helped Rothermere in some respects. The digital revolution means his team will tell regulators the new group will not be competing with other newspapers, but with the likes of Meta and Google. Meanwhile, the Labour government is pressuring regulators to act in a more “pro-growth” manner. “Go back five or 10 years and a Mail/Telegraph deal would have been unlikely to go through, and you wouldn’t have seen Comcast [the owner of Sky] look to try and buy ITV’s broadcasting business,” said Becket McGrath, a partner at the law firm Euclid Law. “But deals that historically would not have got through are being done. The [Competition and Markets Authority] is still having a close look, but it is being more flexible with remedies and solutions.” Some speculate Rothermere may have to offload other titles. That could be painful. He has a personal attachment to Metro. The idea for a London freesheet was first dreamed up by his father, who gave him the task of delivering it. There have been recent cuts at Metro, which some staff fear is a precursor to a sale. The i Paper also underwent a recent restructure. DMGT figures still feel confident they have a good case for taking on the Telegraph without offloading other titles. Rothermere has promised to keep the Telegraph and Mail titles editorially separate, regarding them as serving different audiences – broadsheet and mid-market. However, there are concerns inside both titles over cuts and the longer-term plans, given the state of the newspaper industry. Again, the family has shown a willingness to take drastic action when required. When Rothermere’s father was trying to rescue an ailing Daily Mail in 1971, he merged it with the Daily Sketch, brutally sacking hundreds of journalists in the process. Among them was Barry Norman, subsequently the BBC’s film critic. Walter Terry, the Mail’s political correspondent, was asked to hand out the redundancy letters because everybody liked him. The Mail made internal redundancies earlier this year, following greater integration of the paper and online product. However, DeGroote said there were huge backroom savings to be found before newsrooms were touched. “I don’t think they’re going to slash and burn at all, because the journalism is quite different across the two brands. I don’t see there being huge personnel cuts. But the back end of any media organisation will have meaningful procurement benefits.” Nandy has requested that DMGT and RedBird IMI submit the proposed deal to the government within three weeks, but the outstanding issues will ensure the saga rumbles on well into next year. “A company that owns the Mail and the Telegraph would have the scale to give both papers a better chance of surviving,” said Dacre. “But, even then, such a company would be a pygmy compared to the giant internet platforms and the BBC from whom most people today get their news. And that news is indisputably, I would argue, presented through a liberal prism. Now that’s a monopoly the regulators would do well to address.” Vere, 31, Rothermere’s eldest son, is already being groomed to take control of the family empire, holding a senior role in DMGT’s media business. Whether his responsibilities will include control of the Telegraph is the next great chapter in the Rothermere media saga. • This article was amended on 1 December 2025 to remove the date from the picture caption of Bill Deedes in his office at the Daily Telegraph; it was not taken in 2015 as an earlier version said."
news_ng-interactive_2025_oct_25_how-does-he-pay-for-it-all-the-mystery-of-prince-andrews-money.txt,news,2025-10-25,Rob Evans,How does he pay for it all? The mystery of Prince Andrew’s money,https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/25/how-does-he-pay-for-it-all-the-mystery-of-prince-andrews-money,"It is one of the mysteries of the modern monarchy – and one that is under more scrutiny than ever before. How on earth does Prince Andrew fund his lifestyle? This is a man who has lived a life of luxury for decades, been an outcast for years because of his association with Jeffrey Epstein, yet has no visible means of financial support. Even King Charles is said to be unsure about some of the sources of his brother’s income, particularly how he finds the significant sums of money needed to afford the upkeep of his home, the 30-room Royal Lodge. The disgraced prince has been able to keep his financial affairs from the public for years through a mixture of the traditional secrecy which envelops the Windsors and the confidentiality of his dealings with wealthy, mainly foreign, people. But the public furore over his alleged abuse of Virginia Giuffre may make it more difficult for him to justify the grandeur in which he has been living and to maintain the veil around his financial affairs. The outrage has punctured the usually suffocating consensus within Westminster in which politicians refrain from publicly criticising the royal family. Keir Starmer has said he favours proper scrutiny of the prince’s housing arrangements, and a committee of senior MPs has now requested more details. Among those speaking out this week was Robert Jenrick, the Tory shadow justice secretary, who said: “It’s about time Prince Andrew took himself off to live in private and make his own way in life. He has disgraced himself, he has embarrassed the royal family time and again. The public are sick of him.” Andrew’s only current source of income that is declared is the pension he gets from his days in the navy between 1979 and 2001. This is said to amount to £20,000 a year – hardly enough to buy chalet Helora, the lodge in Switzerland that he acquired in 2014 for a reported £18m, nor to maintain the Royal Lodge, a Georgian mansion sitting in 40 hectares of secluded grounds in Windsor Great Park. Andrew acquired the lease to the lodge in 2003 after making a one-off payment of £1m after the death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who had lived there until the year before she died. As part of the deal, he was required to spend £7.5m on refurbishing the property. Official records suggest he completed the bulk of the renovation by 2005. He pays no rent. The conditions of the lease require him to keep the mansion in good condition to avoid being evicted. Last year a newspaper report suggested the mansion needed repairing, with signs of peeling and black mould. The bill was an estimated £2m. He also faces a bill for his police security – reportedly £3m a year – after Charles stopped funding it. Public records show that the late queen’s second son received official payments from the public purse as a working royal between 1978 and 2010. In 2011, David Cameron, while prime minister, decided to change the way the monarchy was funded by taxpayers. As part of this change, Cameron, a self-described “passionate monarchist”, deliberately prevented the regular publication of how much public money Andrew and the other Windsors received. Cameron decried the “painful annual discussion on every aspect of royal expenditure, accompanied by a tabloid-led debate about whether individual members of the family were ‘good value for money’”. The last published figure for how much public money Andrew received is £249,000 a year in 2010. After that, the queen made direct payments to him from her own private wealth while he carried out royal engagements. In 2019, he was forced to stand down as a working royal as a result of his disastrous BBC interview about the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged abuse of Giuffre. Over the previous four decades, he had received nearly £13m to fund his royal work, according to an investigation by the Guardian in 2023 as part of its cost of the crown series on the monarchy. After 2019 it appears the queen and Charles continued to give Andrew an annual allowance from the Windsors’ private wealth, believed to be £1m a year. But the king reportedly stopped paying this last year amid the “siege of Royal Lodge”. Charles has long wanted him to move into more modest accommodation. When Andrew retired from the navy in 2001, he enjoyed a measure of popularity as he was well regarded for his naval service, particularly fighting in the Falklands war. He could have lived on the income he was receiving from the public purse – at £249,000, a significant amount for ordinary Britons – and carry out good works as a diligent royal. But he wanted money – and lots of it. In 2001, he was appointed to be the government’s trade representative. Formally this job required him to travel abroad and help drum up business for British companies. But it has long been alleged that, on the side, Andrew exploited this post to gain access to wealthy people around the world and cut commercial deals to enrich himself, either by acting as a middleman or making introductions. The claim he faced was that he was using his public role for personal gain, or put more simply, corruption. Getting to the truth has been hindered by successive governments’ refusal to disclose documents that could help explain Andrew’s activities. Andrew Lownie, who wrote a book about the prince called Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, submitted hundreds of freedom of information requests over four years but to no avail. “It is clear that obstructions have been placed in front of Andrew. One has to ask why,” he has said. His relations with wealthy people appear to be largely transactional, particularly since his commercial acumen was seen as minimal. Lownie has cited Epstein as an example. “The prince was a useful idiot who gave him respectability and access to political leaders and business opportunities. What drew Andrew to Epstein? An opportunity to join the super rich and a lifestyle to which the duke had long aspired, a supply of available women, a chance to make money himself and someone who would bankroll his life … both men, ostensible friends, used each other but it was an unequal relationship.” Andrew was the subject of a series of controversies over his close links with unsavoury foreign dictators and businessmen. He took a holiday with a Libyan gun smuggler, criticised a Serious Fraud Office investigation into corruption involving the arms giant BAE and lunched at Buckingham Palace with a leading member of the subsequently deposed Tunisian dictatorship. His dealings with the elite of Kazakhstan show a flavour of what he was up to. In 2007, he sold Sunninghill, a mansion near Ascot that had been a wedding present from the queen, to the son-in-law of the autocratic president of Kazakhstan for £3m over the £12m asking price. Andrew made regular official and private trips to the country. The media reported the contents of emails that suggested Andrew worked for Greek and Swiss firms who were bidding for large contracts in Kazakhstan in 2011. It was Andrew’s job to help introduce the firms to senior Kazakh political figures. He was to have been paid a commission of 1%, or £3.85m, for helping broker a successful deal, according to the reports. By 2011 the stench around Andrew, then fourth in line to the throne, was too much for the government and he was forced to step down as the trade representative. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and former minister who had called for his removal, said: “It is not before time – and there are quite a lot of people in the Foreign Office who will be very pleased too, even if they cannot say so.” The move followed the publication of the now notorious photograph of him with his arm around Guiffre and criticism that he was still consorting with Epstein after he had been convicted. Epstein had given £15,000 to Andrew’s former wife, Sarah Ferguson, to reduce some of her debts. Like Andrew, Ferguson has faced long-standing criticism of seeking to use her royal status to make money. Andrew’s efforts to pull in millions have continued in recent years but have remained opaque. Glimpses are seen in court documents from time to time. Last year, it was revealed that Yang Tengbo, a business partner of the prince, was alleged to be a Chinese spy. The prince had authorised Tengbo to seek investors in China as part of a commercial initiative they were promoting. In 2022, Andrew faced calls to explain why he received at least £750,000 in payments linked to Selman Turk, a financier who was facing allegations of fraud in the high court. Andrew repaid the money. Another source of Andrew’s wealth will be investments in the shares of commercial companies but the value of these are unknown. The Guardian has revealed that the prince took advantage of a government-backed shell company that was created to conceal royal investments from public scrutiny. Andrew would also probably have received bequests from relatives but details are hard to come by. What now for Andrew’s finances? If the furore dies down and he fades from public view, he may be freed up to make more money in the future, but he may also find it more difficult to capitalise on his now-ruined royal status."
news_ng-interactive_2025_oct_26_do-populists-always-crash-the-economy.txt,news,2025-10-26,Heather Stewart Economics editor,Do populists always crash the economy?,https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/26/do-populists-always-crash-the-economy,"“Cambio, cambio.” Under the blazing sun, dozens of money changers are hawking US dollars along Florida Street, a bustling pedestrian strip in Buenos Aires. Known as arbolitos (“little trees”), they are thriving ahead of the 26 October midterm elections in a country long used to saving in the greenback. “The best time to buy is now,” says one arbolito, declining to give her name. “[The dollar] went down a little but it is a fake-out – it’ll rise again.” Like her, economists across the spectrum expect a devaluation of the Argentine peso once the voting is over. The president, Javier Milei, has placed a cap on the currency to tame triple-digit inflation and now it remains overvalued and reserves are depleted, leaving Argentina’s economy stagnant as consumers turn to cheap imports. Luciano Galfione, a textile industrialist, says the 75-year-old family company he heads is living through “the worst moment in its history”. Since the chainsaw-wielding Milei took office, Galfione has laid off almost 50 workers and suspended 45 more at his Buenos Aires mill as consumption has slumped. Between December 2023 and July 2025, 18,000 businesses have closed and 253,800 registered jobs have been lost, according to the Centre for Argentine Political Economy (CEPA). Alongside the exchange rate freeze, which made Argentina the most expensive country in South America, Milei’s government – unlike Donald Trump’s – has reduced or scrapped tariffs, leaving heavily taxed local industries at a disadvantage against Chinese imports. “It’s the perfect storm,” says Galfione, seeing no easy exit for Milei from his predicament. “If he devalues the currency, inflation will soar. For now, his only achievement is containing it – at the cost of a major recession.” Together with the retirees who protest against deep cuts in their pensions outside Congress every Wednesday, Galfione is among those counting the costs of Argentina’s turn to Milei two years ago. Milei’s populist experiment now faces a defining moment. From Trump (who is trying to prop up Milei and the peso with a $20bn (£15bn) currency lifeline) to Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and the UK’s Nigel Farage, politicians around the world are closely watching what happens when populist economic prescriptions collide with reality. Fertile ground Argentina is a very special case. The country has been repeatedly racked by debt defaults and economic crises and its voters have been susceptible over the years to leftwing populism, in the form of the powerful Peronist movement, and now Milei’s rightwing version. Milei is a textbook populist: charismatic, iconoclastic, promising muscular policies to wrest back control of the economy from the establishment on behalf of the people. These key characteristics are shared by his ally to the north, Trump, and by Farage, who styles himself as a pint-swilling people’s champion despite being a privately educated former stockbroker. Until recent months, Milei’s approach – involving extensive privatisations and deep public spending cuts – had won plaudits from the IMF for helping to bring inflation under control. The programme has something in common with that of Milei’s idol Margaret Thatcher, who also saw inflation as a dragon to be slain, no matter the cost. But financial markets began losing confidence in Milei’s radical project in recent months after a shaky result in provincial elections and a series of corruption scandals. Only massive financial intervention by Trump has averted what looked set to become a full-blown currency crisis. Milei’s travails raise wider questions about the appeal of charismatic populists who wield simple answers in today’s complex and fragmented global economy. Across Europe, the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis has been fertile ground for populists to flourish in. Ordinary citizens bore the costs of rebuilding after the great crash while banks were bailed out by the taxpayer. The Covid pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine brought fresh turmoil. Stagnant living standards, as evidenced by sluggish wage growth and surging prices, have driven a hunger for change – and for scapegoats. In France, Emmanuel Macron is trying to avoid calling a snap election for fear of his centre-right Renaissance party succumbing to the populist Marine Le Pen. Public dissatisfaction with a package of austerity policies aimed at tackling France’s yawning deficit and placating jittery bond markets is at the heart of the tussle. Italian voters turned to the charismatic rightwing populist Meloni in 2022. She had served in Silvio Berlusconi’s coalition cabinet as a member of the far-right National Alliance and founded her own party,Brothers of Italy, in 2011, offering a radical rightwing alternative to the austerity policies of Mario Monti’s technocratic government. She has not brought the tear-it-all-down approach to economic policy deployed by Milei – she quietly dropped earlier calls for Italy to leave the euro, for example – but she has appealed to voters’ desire to overturn the status quo, blaming immigration for Italy’s struggles. In the UK, the appeal of Farage is not hard to diagnose, says Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford’s Nuffield College. “The answer is probably quite simple: people feel rotten about the economy and have done since the end of Covid or the start of the Ukraine war. They switched government, they still feel awful, they don’t trust the main parties, so they turn to someone who says: ‘Everything needs to be disrupted: trust me.’” Contradictions The vote for Brexit in 2016 arguably had some of the same logic, and its figurehead, Boris Johnson, swept away doubts about economic detail with a bullish determination to implement the “will of the people” in the face of the establishment’s horror. Farage has so far committed few policies to paper aside from a call for mass deportations, which he subsequently appeared to revise on the hoof. He wants to rein in the Bank of England, perhaps even ditching its governor, Andrew Bailey, with scepticism of a stodgy establishment being a key part of the populist package. His tax and spending policies appear to be in flux: wary of being accused of planning a Liz Truss-style splurge, he recently abandoned a promise to make £90bn of tax cuts. His Reform party deputy, Richard Tice, said they would concentrate instead on public spending cuts. Labour hopes this stance will enable it to portray Farage as planning to bring back austerity – a point Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has made repeatedly, contrasting it with her approach of increasing public investment. Jo Michell, a professor of economics at the University of the West of England, says there are contradictions in Farage’s economic programme, such as it is. “Reform are bankrolled by very wealthy people demanding tax cuts and deregulation, but also talking a lot about the grievances of working people and the loss of industrial jobs and things that really resonate,” he says. “There’s a tension there between rich backers who want Thatcherism on steroids, and this narrative of bringing back British jobs and reindustrialisation.” Farage enjoys the company of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs but has also promised to reopen shuttered steelworks and run them on British coal. Michell says if a Farage government tried to implement massive tax giveaways to the wealthy without a plan to fund them, it would go down about as well with international investors that lend to the UK as Truss’s mini-budget. “If it was tax cuts without spending cuts, the markets would puke,” he says. Reform would face the same formidable challenge in winning over the markets as governments of all stripes in many developed economies currently do. Hefty public debts run up through the financial crisis and the Covid years, combined with the need for more spending on defence and ageing societies, mean borrowing has been rising in many countries simultaneously, making bond markets unusually volatile – with knock-on effects for interest rates. Despite the risks, as in the Brexit campaign it is unclear how successful detailed rebuttal of Reform’s economic policy is likely to be. Reeves has recently acknowledged that Brexit is one reason the Office for Budget Responsibility has cut its growth forecasts, but Labour has been consistently reluctant to lean into the issue. Ansell says successfully taking on populist arguments requires deft political communication. “You have to do it with a lot of charisma, with humour,” he says. The leftwing economist Ann Pettifor agrees that no one should be surprised by the allure of economic populism. “There’s real anger about the wrongness of the system, which is structurally impoverishing the many and enriching the few,” she says. Her riposte to the likes of Milei, Trump and Farage would be a left populism, akin to that on offer from the New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani or the Green party leader for England and Wales, Zack Polanski, or once upon a time by Jeremy Corbyn, that challenges the power of corporations, central banks and the super-rich. “Trump is saying: ‘We should blame Mexico and Canada and China,’” Pettifor says. “The left should be saying the problem is Silicon Valley and Wall Street.” Trump shares Milei’s love of chaos and showbiz but his approach does not fit straightforwardly into his Argentinian ally’s laissez-faire playbook. While Trump has cut taxes for the wealthy and slashed regulation in some sectors, his administration has also taken stakes in strategic firms and used trade policy as a political weapon – a muscular interventionism more familiar in Beijing than Washington. So far the impact of the tariff blitz on the US economy appears to be relatively muted, though it is being masked by the historic boom in AI investment, which a growing number of experts warn may be a bubble. Many experts believe Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve and blatant disregard for the rule of law may ultimately be more corrosive for the future health of the US economy than his erratic trade policies. Holding on to power In truth, the evidence suggests neither left nor right populists tend to fare well when faced with real-world challenges (though of course each charismatic individual claims to offer something unique). A recent paper in the American Economic Review analysed the performance of 51 populist presidents and prime ministers, from 1900 to 2020. It found that on average, after 15 years, gross domestic product per head tends to be 10% lower in countries run by populist leaders than in similar economies with more mainstream regimes. “Economic disintegration, decreasing macroeconomic stability and the erosion of institutions typically go hand in hand with populist rule,” argue the paper’s authors, Manuel Funke, Moritz Schularick and Christoph Trebesch. Another intriguing finding of the research, though, is that despite their economic costs, these leaders tend to be good at holding on to power, lasting on average eight years, compared with four for their more moderate equivalents. In other words, it is not clear that even when their plans crash, populists immediately pay the price at the ballot box. Like the Brexiters’ promise to “take back control”, their appeal reaches beyond mundane economics. But back in Buenos Aires, whether Milei’s populist project collapses or is kept on life support by Trump, Argentina’s citizens have already paid a heavy price.

commentisfree_2025_dec_01_australia-response-hiv-world-aids-day-memorial-names.txt,opinion,2025-11-30,Leigh Boucher,Reciting the names of the dead: how Australia’s response to HIV/Aids was emotionally – and politically – powerful,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/01/australia-response-hiv-world-aids-day-memorial-names,"Aids has always been laden with political and emotional volatilities. The possibility of blood- or sex-based transmission combined with its first emergence among marginalised and criminalised populations created a potent mix of primal terror and terrifying prejudice. It can sometimes be difficult to remember just how potently misinformation, fear and outright hostility framed the knowledge and experience of Aids in the first decade or so of the pandemic. In this period, a positive result on an HIV test was a terminal diagnosis and medical knowledge about transmission and treatment was still cloudy. In Australia in the 1980s it was an easy slide from epidemiological concentration among gay men, sex workers and IV drug users to moralising approbation and discrimination. Some parliamentarians and church leaders in Australia even suggested the forced imprisonment of anyone who tested positive for HIV. Today in Africa shame and morality combine in a different way. More than half the global population of those living with HIV and Aids are found in southern and central Africa, where prevalence among adults in some countries is more than 10%. Here, transmission is primarily heterosexual, and it is the gap between assumptions of monogamy and the gendered realities of sexual practice that pose the biggest public health challenge. It is the most sexually vulnerable, then, in whom rates of transmission are growing most troublingly – namely among younger women. Public health experts across the world knew it would be difficult to overcome the potent forces of shame, stigma and fear that textured the response to Aids. That is why public information officers at the World Health Organization invented World Aids Day on 1 December in 1988. They hoped it would become a powerful weapon in the fight against Aids and misinformation. Within queer communities, World Aids Day has always served a memorialising and politicising purpose as well. Already in 1988, only six years after Australia’s first diagnosis of what had initially been described as “Grid” (gay-related immune disorder), various kinds of memorial practices were evolving to make sense of increasing loss on queer terms as well as act as a pressure point to shape health policy. In Sydney that year, World Aids Day was transformed into a moment when those most affected by the existential threats could reckon with the memories, histories, present and future of the pandemic in ways that made sense to them. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads In the afternoon, activists, affected communities, government leaders, bureaucrats, health workers and carers came together to display the Australian Aids quilt for the first time. During the proceedings, the Rev Jim Dykes read the names, one by one, of the lives commemorated on its panels. That the Aids quilt was sometimes wryly described as the “doona of death” reminds us that a queer sense of irony remained a crucial dimension in lived experience of Aids, even if those jokes sometimes strained at the edges of comfort. Later that evening, a larger gathering came together in Martin Place for a rally that was simultaneously an activist demand for government funding, a marker of thanks to an army of volunteer carers and workers, and a memorial to lives already lost. The following weekend, a smattering of social functions and club nights raised money for carer organisations, including at a party for the care workers themselves, many of whom were already exhibiting signs of carer fatigue. The evening rally would evolve in the coming years into an event that brought together close to 10,000 people in the Domain. Reciting the names of those who had died became the emotional anchor of the proceedings. Community leaders remember both steeling themselves to read those names into the microphone and being left with a profound sense of the beauty and warmth of its effects. That this recitation took longer and longer as the 1990s unfolded was a brutal reminder that the tidal wave of Aids was decimating queer communities. Gay men in the mid-1990s described losing partners and friends in such concentration that their entire social and intimate world seemed to disappear. One man I interviewed recently described walking down a street in Darlinghurst in 1996 and realising that in every house he walked past, he knew someone who had died. In Australia the worst of the Aids crisis was brought under control, first by the incredible success of safe-sex campaigns and the provision of needle exchanges and then, in 1996, because the emergence of “combination therapies” transformed HIV/Aids from a terminal to a chronic diagnosis. While comparable national contexts such as the US and Britain faced rising rates of HIV and Aids diagnosis well into the 1990s, the peak in Australia occurred in 1988 followed by a sharp decline. The only possible explanation for this is the remarkable success of safe-sex campaigns that were spearheaded and designed by activists and supported by state and commonwealth governments, sometimes quietly, that were convinced by the case that moralising about sex would not prevent transmission. Researchers now describe the “Australian response” to Aids as both a historical phenomenon and a public health model to be followed. Its success was remarkable. There is a lot to celebrate in the history of our national model, not least because it is such a powerful example of how a public health catastrophe can be managed and ameliorated when government policy and funding is informed by community knowledge and expertise. There is also, however, a heartbreaking historical irony in this Australian story. The success meant that, in historical and epidemiological terms, HIV/Aids remained remarkably concentrated. In the late 1990s, between 80% and 90% of all recorded HIV/Aids diagnoses in Australia were among men who had sex with men. That most gay men started wearing condoms by the mid-1980s in Australia meant that all Australians were protected from the worst possibilities of the pandemic. The government did not need to quarantine gay men: their own sexual practices ensured that the consequences of HIV/Aids would remain contained. We have now learned to describe HIV/Aids as a pandemic because of its global circulation. But the impacts of this circulation have been uneven. The HIV/Aids pandemic has, perhaps, always been experienced and unfolded as a set of interconnected “epidemics” shaped by national and local conditions. The consequences of HIV/Aids have been and will continue to be made by the agency of humans who confronted it, as well as the choices of those in positions of authority and capacity to do something about it. • Leigh Boucher is an associate professor of history at Macquarie University.

commentisfree_2025_dec_01_bra-fitter-moment-of-connection-amidst-loneliness.txt,opinion,2025-12-01,Jodi Wilson,I needed new bras but what really lifted me up was a moment of connection with my bra fitter,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/01/bra-fitter-moment-of-connection-amidst-loneliness,"On a work trip to Melbourne, I detoured into the city to get fitted for a bra. A friend had shared that it was an experience all women should have because, regardless of age and body type, a supportive bra is always worthwhile; as is the firm yet kind guidance of a professional fitter who has seen it all. “It was her hand on my upper back to steady me,” my friend said. “It made me cry.” Despite my tendency to recoil from department stores, I went to level three seeking a small moment of guidance, with a supportive hand on my back. I breastfed four babies for eight years, wearing maternity bras for too many months after my youngest had weaned. The elastic had stretched and the stitching had frayed. These bras were not unlike me: tired, soft around the edges and a little threadbare. Now as I enter perimenopause, I’m having a hard time articulating exactly how to define the change, even though the shift into a new life stage is overt. I heard that the first symptom is rather ambiguous – feeling not quite like yourself – and I nod and think: That’s precisely how I feel. I beeline for a woman who wears her glasses on the tip of her nose and threads straps on to coat hangers without looking. Her name is Debbie, she asks my name and what I want. “Nothing fussy,” I tell her. “Good basics.” She moves quickly from one display to another and points out my options, collects my preferences in one hand, describes the style of each, and how I can expect them to fit. She’s shown me exactly what I envisioned buying but I am aghast at the cup size. It’s a visual reminder of what’s most inevitable: we age and grow. It’s the humbling nature of getting older in a world that actively tries to suppress it. Within the intimate confines of the change room I try not to focus too much on the softness of my belly, my pale winter skin mottled under the lights, all the improvements that could be made but probably won’t be. Debbie speaks calmly, adjusts the straps, points out the separation between my breasts, comments on the fact that I’m filling the cups well. She asks me if I feel held. “Yes, I do.” I think about this word for the rest of the day: held. It’s what we all want, isn’t it? A bit of stability in this uncertain world, even if it’s momentary. Debbie smiles and remarks on how easy it was to find what I needed. I walk away with a few basics that will, ideally, last a few years, but it’s our fleeting interaction I’ll remember most. It reminded me of the bolstering nature of conversation with another human, amplifying the dull and lonely transactions of online shopping. In an increasingly convenient, AI-assisted world, we’re less and less likely to have these engagements with each other – planned or incidental – and with this loss we sidestep the opportunity to care, and be cared for. This is such a vital part of being human because it is an experience that feels meaningful in the moment, and reverberates within us for a long time afterwards. Loneliness has been proven to be as physically detrimental as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Casual interactions are now recognised as early mental health intervention, particularly for vulnerable new mothers who are prone to isolation. The conversations we have with the bra-fitter, the barista at the local cafe and the person you wait with at the bus stop all give us a dose of optimism and encouragement. They provide a sense of connection, even in the middle of the city where we anonymously scuttle from one place to the next. I wonder if Debbie and her colleagues see women in the street wearing ill-fitting bras and wish they could usher them to a claimed corner of the department store and sort them out, lift them up, take away the weight that pulls on their shoulders; lift a little of their life heaviness. In a world as busy and distracted as ours, we all need small moments of tenderness, and we all need to feel the supportive and stabilising experience of being held. • Jodi Wilson is a health journalist and author of four books, including A Brain That Breathes: Essential habits for an overwhelming world, which will be published in January.

commentisfree_2025_dec_01_gay-conversion-therapy-should-be-consigned-to-history-in-the-us-it-could-make-a-comeback.txt,opinion,2025-12-01,David Kirp,"Gay ‘conversion therapy’ should be consigned to history. In the US, it could make a comeback",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/01/gay-conversion-therapy-should-be-consigned-to-history-in-the-us-it-could-make-a-comeback,"Homosexuality is an illness that therapists can and should cure: that’s the rationale for “conversion therapy”, a practice promoted as a way to change an individual’s sexual orientation from gay to straight. But a host of studies conclude that such counseling doesn’t work – small wonder, since sexual orientation is a core part of an individual’s identity. It’s also potentially harmful, especially for minors. Research shows that youth subjected to conversion practices, often at the insistence of misguided parents, are prone to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness and suicide. Until recently, this medieval practice seemed destined for the dustbin of discredited psychological theories. National mental health associations have recommended that the practice be prohibited, because it’s based on the homophobic “assumption that diverse sexual orientations and gender identities are mental illnesses”, as the American Psychiatric Association puts it. Twenty-three states have banned it for minors, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Now, however, it is making a comeback. This term, the US supreme court will decide whether a law prohibiting conversion practices infringes on constitutionally protected free speech. During last month’s oral argument in that case, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned whether the regulation wasn’t “just the functional equivalent” of another recent supreme court case. In June, the court upheld a ban on a different treatment – puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans youth. “It just seems odd to me that we might have a different result here,” she said. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, meanwhile, likened conversion therapy to a dietitian telling a client to do something physically harmful, saying: “I don’t think the state has to provide a study to show that the advice is not sound.” Nonetheless, comments from the bench during that argument indicate that the rightwing majority will strike down these laws. Anguished survivors fear the disastrous consequences of such a ruling. They’re speaking out on social media. “I was sent to conversion therapy against my will. I endured it for six months. I was a shell of a person after, and almost took my own life … I feel compelled to plead that we cannot accept this,” one survivor wrote, according to Cosmopolitan. “Seeing what’s coming from the supreme court really terrifies me,” said another. “I’m fearful for younger generations that could be subjected to this.” By attempting to brainwash gay youth into becoming “normal”, conversion practices promotes Donald Trump’s war on the LGBTQ+ community. That explains why, relying on junk science, a Department of Health and Human Services report issued last spring appeared to support the practice. During his New York City days, the president voiced support for LGBTQ+ rights. Since then, however, he has become the arch-antagonist. Attacking trans people has proven a surefire winner for the Maga crowd. An executive order, issued only hours after he was sworn in, mandates that passports recognize only two sexes, male and female. That edict upends the lives of an estimated 1.3 million adults who identify as trans or gender non-conforming. Trump has also brought his gay-bashing campaign to the schoolhouse. “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,” an executive order issued his second day in the White House, prohibits federal funding for schools that introduce “gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology” in the classroom. That vague language has made teachers petrified to say anything about trans individuals. Trump’s yes men are doing their best to drive gay people into the closet. The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has banned trans individuals from serving in the military, and that’s likely to be just the start of his witch-hunt. Hegseth has suggested that allowing gay people to serve openly in the armed forces prioritizes social justice over unit cohesion and military readiness – a claim for which there isn’t a scintilla of evidence. He renamed the USNS Harvey Milk, which honored the gay rights icon and navy veteran, timing the move – intentionally, according to a military.com report – during Pride month. At the FBI, a longtime employee says he was fired for having had a rainbow flag on his desk. . The administration has moved to cut more than $800m in research grants including on LGBTQ+ health, claiming that the studies led to “unscientific” results that ignore “biological realities”. The federally-funded 988 suicide and crisis hotline ended its services for LGBTQ+ youth, apparently because it promotes “radical gender ideology”. How heartless can you get? There’s no end of targets for the bully in the White House to slap around. You can include the LGBTQ+ community on the roster of groups – immigrants, religious and ethnic minorities, African Americans, women, disabled and low-income individuals – that are already feeling the lash of a president who seems hellbent on turning the nation into an autocracy. Doubtlessly, there’s more and worse to come. Ben Franklin nailed it: “We must all hang together or we will all hang separately.” Although resisting the Trump juggernaut is an uphill battle, these groups need to join forces in a groundswell of protest – No Kings indeed.

commentisfree_2025_dec_01_gaza-west-bank-syria-lebanon-israel-ceasefire.txt,opinion,2025-12-01,Nesrine Malik,"It’s not just Gaza. From the West Bank to Syria and Lebanon, Israel’s onslaught continues",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/01/gaza-west-bank-syria-lebanon-israel-ceasefire,"It is clear now that the ceasefire in Gaza is only a “reducefire”. The onslaught continues. There are near-daily attacks on the territory. On a single day at the end of October, almost 100 Palestinians were killed. On 19 November, 32 were killed. On 23 November, 21. And on it goes. Since the ceasefire, more than 300 have been killed and almost 1,000 injured. Those numbers will rise. The real shift is that the ceasefire has reduced global attention and scrutiny. Meanwhile, Israel’s emerging blueprint becomes clearer: bloody domination not only in Gaza, but across Palestine and the wider region. A “dangerous illusion that life in Gaza is returning to normal”, is how Amnesty International’s secretary general, Agnès Callamard, described this post-ceasefire period. Israeli authorities have reduced attacks and allowed some aid into Gaza, she said, but “the world must not be fooled. Israel’s genocide is not over.” Not a single hospital in Gaza has returned to being fully operational. The onset of rain and cooling weather has left thousands exposed in dilapidated tents. Since the ceasefire on 10 October, almost 6,500 tonnes of UN-coordinated relief materials have been denied entry into Gaza by Israeli authorities. According to Oxfam, in the two weeks after the ceasefire alone, shipments of water, food, tents and medical supplies from 17 international NGOs were denied. The result is that a population whose homes, livelihoods and stable shelter have been eliminated still are not allowed to secure safer tents or adequate food. Israeli authorities hold people in Gaza in a painful purgatory, continuing collective punishment, preventing the conditions for a normal life from emerging and establishing Israel as sole unaccountable overlord, with unlimited power over the people of the territory. Gaza is at the sharp end of an expansion of Israeli imperialism, one that stretches to the West Bank and beyond. In the occupied territories of the West Bank, a crackdown that has intensified since 7 October 2023 continues to escalate into a full military siege. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been forced out of their homes this year in a pattern that Human Rights Watch said amounted to “war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing … that should be investigated and prosecuted”. Last week, footage emerged of two Palestinian men in Jenin being executed by Israeli soldiers after it appeared that they had surrendered. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, said that the forces involved in the killings have his “full backing”. They “acted exactly as expected of them – terrorists must die”. And this is only a small window, in a rare filmed moment, into the bloodshed. More than 1,000 people have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank over the past two years. One in five of them are children. More than 300 cases were suspected “extrajudicial executions”. In October of this year, the UN registered more than 260 settler attacks, the highest level since its records began 20 years ago. More than 93% of investigations into these attacks end with no charges filed. Scores of Palestinian prisoners are reported to die in Israeli prisons of physical violence or medical neglect, and those who do make it out alive recount a hellscape of torture and abuse. And still, the parameters of Israel’s mandate to assault, kill and land grab continue to widen. Last week, Israeli forces launched a ground incursion in southern Syria, killing 13 Syrians, among them children. The Israeli military refused to provide information on the group it claimed to be targeting in the raid. It was simply reserving its right to reach into Syrian territory, as it has several times since it invaded and occupied the buffer zone between the two countries, and other parts of southern Syria. Since it has done so, Israeli forces have been accused by Human Rights Watch of applying the colonial playbook seen in Palestinian territories: forced displacements, home seizures, demolitions, cutting of livelihoods and unlawful transfer of Syrian detainees to Israel. Israel intends to maintain its presence indefinitely. To Lebanon, where 64,000 people still remain displaced from their homes after last year’s war, and where Israeli attacks have been intensifying. Despite a peace deal negotiation last November, Israel has launched almost daily bombings in Lebanese territory. The latest was only last week. It continues to occupy five vantage points from which it launches attacks on targets it claims are linked to Hezbollah. According to a UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Israel is guilty of more than 10,000 air and ground violations of the ceasefire, during which hundreds of people have been killed. In the melee, civilians are, once again, ejected from their lands, vulnerable to Israeli military assaults and essentially subjects of a sort of Israeli super-sovereignty. According to a recent New York Times report, “the situation in Lebanon offers a compelling example of a new Middle East where Israel’s reach is near ubiquitous”. What sort of ceasefires are these? What sort of status quo is this? A volatile and unsustainable one, is the answer, one during which no reasonable mind can expect any sort of peace to materialise, either in Palestine or in the wider Middle East. Brokers and stakeholders and diplomats may repeat the language of phased ceasefires and reconstruction schemes, but the reality is that these are plans for a future that is never going to emerge unless Israel’s unlawful acts across territories that it has no legal rights over come to an end. The dangerous illusion that life is returning to normal applies not only in Gaza, but across Palestine and the wider region. It will soon shatter.

On Sunday, police searched me",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/01/guardian-journalist-victoria-police-new-search-powers-patted-down,"Last week I produced a video for Guardian Australia on expanded Victoria police search powers in the Melbourne CBD. Days later, I experienced that power first-hand. I was covering Sunday’s Put Australia First Rally in Melbourne. The area had just become a “designated area” for six months mere hours earlier. The protest had just begun. Stephanie Convery, my colleague, had stepped away, and so I was alone and away from protesters, standing just inside Flinders Street station with my video gear. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Then two officers, both women, approached. They asked me if I knew that they were allowed to search me without a warrant. “Oh yes, I certainly do,” I said. As our reporting covered, the “designated area” means police and protective service officers (PSOs) can randomly stop and search or pat down anyone without a warrant or reasonable grounds, something that human rights and legal groups have described as a “vast overreach”. They appeared to sense my guardedness. One of the officers explained the new powers to me, like she was reciting a script, continuing even after I interjected a few times to say that I knew what was going on. I asked one of the officers to hold the large video camera and monopod I was carrying, and I lifted my arms. The other officer waved a metal detector from my armpits to my thighs. We discussed the lip balm, batteries and lens cap in my pocket. Police reported that about 700 people attended the Put Australia First rally, but it was still very early. There were only about 200 protesters there and easily as many officers. A big patch of rain had just come through. Soaked officers formed a boundary around the mostly empty intersection in front of Flinders Street station. The protesters huddled together under the cover outside the station, wearing soggy Australian flags, including one with a boxing Kangaroo. “Are you with them?” asked the officer. I told her I was there as media. My arms were still outstretched when Steph returned, approaching us as the officer was telling me to “be careful”, referring to the protesters. As I began rummaging through my bag, unzipping my microphone case and showing the officers a microphone and camera battery, Steph pulled her media pass out of her wallet and told them we worked for Guardian Australia. The search ended very quickly after that. I offered to show the officers the rest of my bags’ contents, but they weren’t interested. They handed us a print-out explaining the powers and then walked away. The same officer repeated her warnings. “Be careful in there,” she said. I am a journalist, and so I have a lot of experience dealing with strangers in ambiguous positions of power. I am also a white woman. I can see how a random street search could quickly turn hostile. And, even if it didn’t, I can see how it could be confronting for some people. For me, it was mainly just awkward. I know the calculation someone makes when their boss asks them to go out and approach strangers. I am often sent out to get vox pops, and I have worked in direct sales. At the protest, rock music with offensive lyrics was blaring from a large portable speaker, a white boxer was barking loudly in the tight crowd, and I spotted what appeared to be a known neo-Nazi on the edge of the dense crowd. I was wearing a Busselton Jetty cap and a purple Kuromi lanyard – nothing that would indicate that I was part of the protest. It made me wonder exactly what direction they had been given that day in terms of who they should pat down or search. On Sunday, the police found a single knuckle duster through the warrantless searches. They did not clarify how many searches they did to find it.

commentisfree_2025_dec_01_how-can-we-navigate-difficult-conversations-these-holidays-buddhism-offers-some-guidance.txt,opinion,2025-11-30,Nadine Levy,How can we navigate difficult conversations these holidays? Buddhism offers some guidance,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/01/how-can-we-navigate-difficult-conversations-these-holidays-buddhism-offers-some-guidance,"When it comes to difficult conversations, I have a way to go. I often swing between hyper-assertiveness and retreating entirely, but both avoid vulnerability. I often tell myself silence is “skilful”, though it can easily turn into passive aggression. And avoidance has consequences – not speaking out of fear can create distance and irreparable damage to relationships and communities. As the Buddhist activist-scholar bell hooks says: “to know love we have to tell the truth to ourselves and to others … Commitment to truth telling lays the groundwork for the openness and honesty that is the heartbeat of love.” That, to me, is the kind of love I aspire to, even if I often miss the mark. So how can we intentionally cultivate our capacity to have difficult conversations in a way that lovingly acknowledges our radical interbeing while honouring what must be said? From a Buddhist perspective, life itself – not simply formal meditation – is our broad field of practice. Which means this question demands serious contemplation. The way we speak and respond to one another, and ourselves, shapes experience and has the real power to harm or to support. The psychiatrist Dan Siegel’s “interpersonal neurobiology” reveals how our nervous systems co-regulate through relationship – through language, tone and presence we bring can either settle or activate another. We are living through times where speech has become a battleground, easily weaponised to shame or silence. The line between freedom of expression and our responsibility to prevent harm is more strained and politicised than ever before. It is no surprise, then, that difficult conversations challenge most of us, even well-seasoned spiritual practitioners. We may sense something needs to be said but we fear rupturing a relationship, so we avoid speaking. Or we may speak impulsively and from a place of reactivity, even rage, with little regard for the damage we will cause. While many of us are committed to speaking our truth (or “the truth” as we see it), we rarely reflect on how to speak with courage and care in a way that supports the collective good rather than eroding it. In Buddhist thought, speech is not merely an act of individual expression but a relational act, one that has the potential, if intentional and compassionate, to contribute to a field of radical, communal care. The psychologist Carol Gilligan’s ethics of care, later taken up by the Buddhist teacher Stephen Batchelor, shifts the ethical question from “what is right?”’ to “what would a caring response look like here?” This is not sentimental, nor is it about being agreeable. It is a radical ethical position, to take relationship seriously and to prioritise mutual interdependencies over rigid positionality. It softens polarisation. From this lens, a difficult conversation is not an argument to be won or a confrontation to be avoided. But something even more creative: a ripe opportunity to know yourself and the other in a deeper, more complex way and to clarify values and bring insight into how we might avoid harming each other in the future. It asks for timing, self-awareness and courage. In the Eightfold Path, the Buddha offers direct guidance in the form of wise speech. It invites us to speak what is true, useful and kind in a way that serves clarity and reduces harm. Our state of mind is relevant before, during and after a conversation. Are we speaking from fear, ego, or a need to be liked? Or are we rooted in clarity, courage and care? Of course, we won’t always get it right but the task is to consciously orient in this direction, over and over. Wise speech is often misunderstood as a call for restraint at all costs, as though we should always be agreeable and nice. But that is a misreading of the Buddha’s words. If we are using kindness to avoid discomfort or maintain control, it no longer aligns with the spirit of the teaching. The Buddha was clear that wise speech includes difficult truths, but only when they meet certain conditions. In the scriptures, the Buddha names five such conditions, explaining wise speech should be timely, true, gentle, beneficial and loving. If one of the conditions is not present, we might decide to stay silent and wait. So, sometimes the art is to hold back, manage our own emotions and simply tend the ground by building enough safety so that truthfulness can take root. The “best” hard conversations I have had have one thing in common: a deep foundation of trust. But when that foundation is missing, the same words could have been wounding or counterproductive. Choosing to bring intentionality to our speech (even on social media!) challenges our tendency to abandon and disconnect from those we do not agree with. In Buddhist practice, we do not use speech to create further distance but to tend to a shared field of care. Speech is a generative force and, with every difficult conversation entered into with heart, we disrupt cycles of harm and sow seeds for a different future rooted not in being right but in honouring our web of interdependence. It may sound utopian but the work is pragmatic and grounded, and the paradox is this: tending to our world with care contributes not only to an ethics of care but also our own sense of peace and integrity in the here and now – a win-win. Courageous and caring conversations are not simply personal development; they are an expression of solidarity in the here and now, solidarity that our shared future depends on.

They account for three-quarters of all deaths by suicide and are more likely to smoke and be overweight. Young men are more likely than young women to die as a result of accidents, violence or overdoses. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, with around 12,000 deaths every year. A public consultation on whether to introduce screening for the disease opened last week, after an expert committee advised against it. So the men’s health strategy for England launched recently by the health secretary, Wes Streeting, should be welcomed on principle. Just as a women’s health lens helps policymakers to focus on female reproductive health and risks, a men’s health lens should enable specific problems to be targeted more effectively. The question is whether our overstretched health system is in a position to use this new tool as it would need to be used if outcomes are to improve. If it isn’t, the document won’t do any harm, but it won’t do much good either, beyond providing an officially endorsed summary and some potentially useful messaging. In terms of resources, the strategy comes with £300m in 2025-26 for community health projects. While this is a useful pot for primary-care innovators to draw on, it is not enough to make a difference nationally. More significant is the upcoming review of the GP funding formula, which ought to result in more funding for poorer areas where people are, on average, less healthy. There is also a pledge to improve data, disaggregating it by sex but also other characteristics, to make the vulnerabilities of specific groups (such as men from particular ethnic minorities, or gay men) clearer. Other new commitments include a campaign to encourage walking and running, following the success of the NHS’s Couch to 5k app. The strategy also signals the government’s support for peer and lived-experience support networks as part of drug and alcohol treatment programmes, and in cancer care. Pilot projects launched under the government’s Get Britain Working strategy have particular relevance to young men who are more likely than young women to be Neet (not in education, employment or training). The new Men’s Health Academic Network, which will provide expert advice, sounds useful, but will need to select its priorities among the daunting number of questions that are raised in the strategy. These include the impact of social media use on the mental health of men and boys, a possible link between internet pornography and sexual dysfunction, and the suggestion that men on average have lower levels of “health literacy” than women. Improving men’s health – including better detection of male cancers – is sensible public policy in its own right and, if communicated well, may also resonate with voters. One £42m trial of prostate cancer screening is already under way. What this strategy, and campaigns related to it, must not become is a distraction from a deeply troubling bigger picture. Enormous waiting lists for treatment and the disruption caused by a costly NHS reorganisation are a problem for men with addiction problems, prostate cancer or any other illness, just as they are for everyone else.

An outrage machine has decided that a forecast of a few billion pounds in a model that makes projections about trillions of pounds of taxes and spending is the lie of the century. We can’t predict the weather next year, but apparently the public finances in 2029 can be judged with pinpoint accuracy. That’s why the headlines about “holes” and “sleaze probes” are a joke. It is theatre, but it is bad theatre. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) possesses no great moral or predictive authority. Yet many of its accusers and defenders treat it as an all‑seeing oracle. In fact, the OBR, to its credit, admits that its medium-term projections are frequently wrong. It often wrongly estimates inflation and productivity, and has had its assumptions upended by unforeseen events. The OBR’s 2019 five-year forecast undershot actual GDP growth by £200bn. Given this degree of error, treating a projected current budget balance of £20bn in 2029-30 as a hard fact is deeply unserious. The government colludes in this fiction. Rachel Reeves wasn’t deceitful – just not candid. Sir Keir Starmer suggested that the OBR had been overzealous in assessing UK productivity once Labour arrived in power – as if civil servants had it in for the incoming government. As it turns out, the OBR has bigger problems than a “bemused” prime minister to deal with – like having a hackable website with market‑sensitive information. The watchdog paid the price – its chair fell on his sword. Ms Reeves and Sir Keir embrace a fiscal rule that requires the current budget surplus in 2029-30 – a target that exists to soothe bond markets. Britain’s economy remains depressed, with a long-term trade deficit and low private-sector investment. Under these conditions, the government must by definition run a deficit – or else see rising unemployment and indebtedness. Pretending otherwise is a polite fiction for “the markets”. And markets, naturally, prefer more “headroom”: it implies less gilt issuance, which pushes up bond prices and pushes down yields. Their preference for austerity is laundered as fiscal rectitude when it is self-interest. In contrast, Labour MPs don’t want public spending – or welfare – cuts and do want ways to tax wealth more effectively. This stance clashes with Ms Reeves’s self-imposed straitjacket. The government’s instability is because it has put itself between the instincts of its MPs and the demands of bond traders. As this column has argued before, there are solutions. The government could reduce the interest bill that drives so much of the deficit. It could tax the banks’ windfall gains from higher rates, as the Liberal Democrats suggest. It could follow former central banker Paul Tucker’s advice and “tier” reserve remuneration, saving billions by cutting the interest paid on commercial banks’ balances, shrinking Threadneedle Street’s losses and reducing costs to the exchequer. It could take its cue from the New Economics Foundation and end the Treasury’s indemnity of the Bank’s quantitative easing losses – boosting Treasury coffers by £20bn annually. These measures would improve the fiscal position without harming Britain’s social fabric. But they require a political imagination that this government has not yet shown. The next Labour leader might have enough of one to dispel the fear of the bond market that is paralysing politicians’ efforts to rebuild Britain.

Why not become a nun …,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/01/tired-of-being-a-woman-in-2025-why-not-become-a-nun,"Nuns are everywhere – we’ve had Isabella Rossellini’s Sister Agnes stealing the show in Conclave and nuns with main character energy in The Phoenician Scheme, And Just Like That and Nine Perfect Strangers. On #nuntok (yes, a thing), real sisters demystify and give surprisingly irreverent glimpses into their lives. There was the Austrian trio jailbreaking from a care home to return to their beloved convent, and at the other end of the demographic scale, a rise in younger women following, or at least considering, cloistered vocations. Nun memes have become a jokey shorthand for real dissatisfaction with life as a woman in 2025 – unsolicited dick pics, workplace discrimination and the endless, soul-sapping scroll. They don’t, mostly, express a yearning for strict religiosity or voluntary celibacy, but for community, purpose and a retreat from chaos. It’s the same impulse that attracts women to single-sex communities or makes them pine, like Stella in Bernard MacLaverty’s brilliant Midwinter Break, for béguinages (the lay communities of single women that flourished in the Low Countries in the middle ages). We all just want peace. Well, sisters, now there’s a self-help book. I have been reading, and highly recommend, Convent Wisdom: how sixteenth-century nuns could save your twenty-first century life, a delightful glimpse into the colourful lives of counter-reformation nuns. The florid religiosity (levitation, mystical visions, eating cat sick and cobwebs) might not be entirely relatable, but it’s thrilling to learn how powerful, purposeful women managed the unreasonable demands of male authority figures, made ends meet and lived on their own (and God’s) terms. It’s salutary, too, to realise any serenity was hard won: they also suffered crushes and complex friendships, finances described as “a demonic mess” (hard relate) and terrible bosses. I warmed, predictably, to Augustinian María de San José, who felt “the greatest repugnance for work” and left behind 12 volumes of lamentations about how awful writing was. I haven’t gleaned practical life hacks or (sorry) habits, but wish I could, like María de Jésus de Agréda, solve my time management issues by bilocating (miraculously being in two places at once). And I have a new unrealistic #fitnessgoal: learn to levitate. • Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_dec_01_uk-sue-foreign-oligarchs-corporations-litigation-offshore-courts.txt,opinion,2025-12-01,George Monbiot,"Hello, foreign oligarchs and corporations! Please come and sue the UK for billions",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/01/uk-sue-foreign-oligarchs-corporations-litigation-offshore-courts,"How do you reckon our political system works? Perhaps something like this. We elect MPs. They vote on bills. If a majority is achieved, the bills becomes law. The law is upheld by the courts. End of story. Well, that’s how it used to work. No longer. Today, foreign corporations, or the oligarchs who own them, can sue governments for the laws they pass, at offshore tribunals composed of corporate lawyers. The cases are held in secret. Unlike our courts, these tribunals allow no right of appeal or judicial review. You or I cannot take a case to them, nor can our government, or even businesses based in this country. They are open only to corporations based overseas. If a tribunal determines that a law or policy may compromise the corporation’s projected profits, it can award damages of hundreds of millions, even billions. These sums represent not actual losses, but money the arbitrators decide the company might otherwise have made. The government may have to abandon its policy. It will be discouraged from passing future laws along the same lines, for fear of being sued. Record numbers of cases are being brought, as corporations learn from each other, and hedge funds finance suits in return for a share of the takings. The result? Sovereignty and democracy are becoming unaffordable. The process is known as “investor-state dispute settlement” (ISDS). The reason it is allowed to override domestic law and the decisions made by parliaments is that this provision has been written – without public consent, and often in conditions of extreme secrecy – into trade treaties. A year ago, Friends of the Earth won a great victory at the high court. The judge ruled that plans to dig the first deep coalmine in the UK for 30 years, at Whitehaven in Cumbria, had been unlawfully approved by the Conservative government, which had accepted the bizarre claim that the mine would have no impact on our carbon budgets. The Labour government then withdrew the permission the Tories had granted. Now this victory could be compromised by an offshore tribunal answering to no one but the corporations petitioning it. In August, a company whose ultimate owners are based in the Cayman Islands lodged a claim against the UK government. Last week a tribunal in Washington DC was set up to hear it. The company is suing the UK for the money it might have made if the mine had been allowed to go ahead. We have no idea how much this might be. Who is representing it against the British government? The MP for Torridge and Tavistock, and former attorney-general in the Conservative government, that great patriot Geoffrey Cox. The government makes a decision, the high court upholds it, then a foreign company challenges it through an undemocratic offshore tribunal, and a member of our parliament acts on its behalf. On the same day (18 November) that the tribunal on the coalmine case was appointed, we learned from a parliamentary answer that the UK is also being sued under ISDS by a Russian oligarch, Mikhail Fridman. We know nothing of the case so far, but it seems likely that he’ll use the tribunal to challenge the sanctions the UK levied against him after the invasion of Ukraine. He has already started suing Luxembourg for this reason, demanding $16bn (£12.1bn): half that government’s annual revenue. Among the lawyers representing him there? Cherie Blair, wife of the former British prime minister. Legal experts believe the EU’s delay in using frozen Russian assets as collateral for its loan to Ukraine arises from Belgium’s fear that it could be sued in the offshore corporate courts, under the Belgium/Luxembourg-Russia bilateral investment treaty. This extraordinary, undemocratic power over elected governments could be blocking the money Ukraine desperately needs. We were assured that such things wouldn’t happen. In 2014, David Cameron, promoting the biggest and most dangerous of all such treaties, told us: “We’ve signed trade deal after trade deal and there has never been a problem in the past.” The House of Lords adviser on this issue, Prof Dennis Novy, accused campaigners of “scaremongering … in reality, ISDS does not affect the UK much”. The overall message seemed to be that only poorer nations needed to fear these lawsuits. I warned, to general mockery, that “as corporations begin to understand the power they’ve been granted, they will turn their attention from the weak nations to the strong ones”. That threat has now materialised. This year, fossil fuel and mining firms have lodged a record number of suits against nations rich and poor, challenging – as in the case of the Cumbrian coalmine – government attempts to stop climate breakdown. Corporations have so far won $114bn (£86bn) through ISDS, of which fossil fuel companies have secured $84bn (£64bn). That equates to the combined GDP of the world’s 45 smallest economies. The average payout these companies have received is $1.2bn (£910m). In some cases they threaten to suck the poorest nations dry. This is climate finance in reverse: huge payments to fossil fuel corporations from governments with the temerity to try to stop an existential crisis. These suits also exert a major chilling effect on governments that would like to go further. France, Denmark and New Zealand have all curbed their climate ambitions for fear of lawsuits, and there are likely many more. We gain nothing from these treaty provisions. A meta-study in 2020 found that, when it comes to encouraging foreign investment, the “effect of international investment agreements is so small as to be considered zero”. A report commissioned by the UK government in 2013 found that ISDS was “highly unlikely to encourage investment” and was “likely to provide the UK with few or no benefits”. Yet Keir Starmer’s government shuts its ears. It has reportedly been trying to push an ISDS mechanism into the investment treaty it is negotiating with India, and into the other trade treaties it is working on. We cannot know for sure, because they’re being negotiated in total secrecy. You could almost believe there were things the government didn’t want us to see. It refuses to talk to campaigners or to offer more information. We have twice beaten attempts to extend ISDS, through vast popular movements against the multilateral agreement on investment and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Now we will need to mobilise again: this time against our own government, which seems to care more for foreign corporations than it does for us. George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_dec_01_us-football-zohran-mamdani-arsenal-fan.txt,opinion,2025-12-01,Bryan Armen Graham,The US love of football is reaching new levels. Just look at Arsenal super-fan Zohran Mamdani,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/01/us-football-zohran-mamdani-arsenal-fan,"When Zohran Mamdani made an appearance on The Adam Friedland Show last week, the newly elected mayor of New York was expecting the typical nimble rundown of politics, jokes and conversational detours. What he wasn’t expecting was Ian Wright suddenly filling a phone screen with a congratulatory video. The former England and Arsenal striker saluted him on “what you’ve achieved”, urged him to channel that “winning energy” into the job ahead before signing off with a nod to the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta. Mamdani cheesed guilelessly as it played before finally blurting out: “I love this man.” For a moment, the incoming mayor of the most powerful city in the United States was simply another geeked-out Arsenal obsessive left weak by one of his childhood heroes. And in that moment lies something revealing about how football fandom in the US has changed. This was not a politician deploying a sports reference for relatability; it was a display of genuine allegiance that’s planted at the intersection of two different stories about how Americans have come to love the global game. What Mamdani’s reaction captured, in miniature, is the broader moment US soccer now finds itself in. Stateside interest has quietly climbed to unprecedented levels: Premier League audiences have grown for more than a decade; every big club now has thriving US supporters’ groups; and football has entered the cultural bloodstream through celebrity-ownership projects such as Ryan Reynolds and Wrexham (and its various rip-offs), through athletes drifting into national politics (Cristiano Ronaldo turning a White House visit into a surreal photo-op) and through the long on-ramp to next summer’s big, beautiful World Cup on home soil. The game is no longer niche, no longer coastal, no longer the preserve of immigrant communities or brunch-hour Europhiles. Mamdani’s politics add another note. His petition against Fifa’s dynamic pricing for 2026 World Cup tickets – which he called an “affront to the game” on the Guardian’s Football Weekly podcast – reflects a view of football as community infrastructure rather than luxury entertainment. It treats the sport as something that belongs to working-class people and immigrant families, not the unfolding late-capitalist hellscape of ticketing algorithms and resale platforms. That stance is both global and deeply local; both socialist and recognisably football-supporter logic. Mamdani’s affinity with Arsenal lands with added weight because it reveals what the sport already means in the US: a cross-class, multi-ethnic, diasporic, online, joyful cultural force. For a couple of decades now, Arsenal in particular have occupied a curiously prominent place in the imaginations of American progressives. During the Arsène Wenger years, the club became a kind of cultural shorthand for the liberal intelligentsia. They played “European” football at a time when the term connoted sophistication: Henry gliding, Pires drifting, Wenger lecturing about diet and psychology. On the east coast, when matches were finally moved from pay-per-view to the broader availability of Fox Soccer channel, 7am kick-offs became ritualised social markers. For many, supporting Arsenal was less a sporting choice than a signal of curated worldliness. But this is only one strand of the US’s football story, and not the one Mamdani comes from. He was born and raised in Kampala and Cape Town before his family relocated when he was seven to Morningside Heights in Upper Manhattan, as the great Wenger teams of the early 00s further informed his sporting consciousness. His Arsenal was the Arsenal of Kanu, Lauren, Kolo Touré, Eboué and Song – a club whose African spine made it beloved across the continent long before it became fashionable in Brooklyn. When he says that Arsenal might be the most popular club in Uganda, he’s expressing a deeper truth about the Premier League’s longstanding place in African diasporic culture. And Arsenal itself increasingly leans in to this heritage. Last season’s alternative kit, designed by the Sierra Leone-born Foday Dumbuya, explicitly honoured its African fanbase. It followed the Jamaica-themed pre-match strip launched at Notting Hill carnival, part of a broader cultural moment that has long intertwined Arsenal with Black British identity and, increasingly, with the US-based Black creative community, where culture-shapers such as Spike Lee and Jay-Z have embraced the club’s diaspora-rich sensibility. The Arsenal that influenced Mamdani is the same Arsenal that helped define modern British multiculturalism, which helps explain why his reaction to Wright resonated so widely. These two versions of fandom – the curated and the inherited – have long existed along parallel tracks in a country of 340 million souls. What feels new is the way these stories are converging. Mamdani’s reaction united them perfectly: the diasporic Arsenal of his childhood colliding with the online Arsenal of US millennials and gen Z. The Premier League’s rise in the US – via NBC’s deft marketing and commercial strategy, social media, Instagram fan accounts and matchday rituals – has flattened the cultural landscape. A Somali teenager in Minneapolis, a Mexican-American kid in Phoenix and a 38-year-old Brooklyn journalist all speak the same meme-literate Gooner dialect now. And a whole lot more of them are wearing Messi’s Inter Miami shirt. The effect is a US football culture that is finally shared. No longer the province of any one demographic, but a hybrid of diaspora, youth culture, TikTok, brunch spots and streetwear. When the mayor-elect of New York fanboys over a message from Ian Wright, it’s tempting to treat it as charming ephemera. But it is also a small window into the country’s evolving sporting psyche – a signpost that the global game has taken root here through diaspora, culture, politics and play. In a country still figuring out what its football identity even is, Mamdani’s reaction offered up a clue: it won’t be imported or inherited whole, but fashioned out of all the places Americans come from and the paths the game has taken to reach them.

commentisfree_2025_dec_01_your-party-conference-legal-spats-beacon-hope.txt,opinion,2025-12-01,Owen Jones,Your Party’s antics assume a luxury the left does not have: time,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/01/your-party-conference-legal-spats-beacon-hope,"Four months is a long time in the history of the British left. When Your Party – now its official name – was launched at the end of July, 800,000 people registered their interest. That qualified as a political phenomenon, and spoke to an unprecedented opportunity for the left. Thanks to an economic model no longer able to offer a sustained rise in living standards or properly functioning public services, and a foreign policy defined by murderous calamities – culminating in Israel’s Gaza genocide – the radical left has its biggest ever receptive audience. But by the time of its founding conference in Liverpool at the weekend, Your Party had offered a masterclass in how the left can never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Members repelled by a Labour devoid of answers to Britain’s multiple crises were ready to listen to a credible, inspiring alternative. Instead, they have been subjected to a bitter public schism between Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, its two leading founders, as well as threats of legal action, public denunciations, unsavoury anonymous briefings to rightwing newspapers and an obsession with internal process. The politically disillusioned have accordingly transferred their attention to Zack Polanski’s Green party, which has clearly repositioned itself on the unapologetic left and been rewarded with a membership of 170,000 and some polling that is ahead of Labour. Given all that, 55,000 people signing up to a new party – nearly as many as the membership of the Liberal Democrats – is impressive. Two and a half thousand conference delegates represented a dramatic scaling down of ambitions, but a sizeable number for an initial gathering. Attenders brimmed with idealism, positivity – and fear of the stakes. “This is the last throw of the dice, we know that,” one delegate told me. “We’ve heard for years, ‘it’s socialism or barbarism’ – and it is socialism or barbarism.” Given the surge of the far right, and questions over the survival of US democracy, Rosa Luxemburg’s famous maxim can no longer be so easily dismissed as hyperbole. But our present danger does not seem to have provoked a general concentrating of minds. Sultana unilaterally announced first the party’s launch, without the agreement of Corbyn, then a portal for people to sign up as members. This was disavowed by her Your Party colleagues, but not before hundreds of thousands of pounds was raised, leading to mutual legal threats. Only some of this has been transferred to Your Party, with Sultana promising to transfer the rest as long as the liabilities of the company that holds the money are settled. Corbyn tells me, “We were worried that we’d be able to even pay for the conference two weeks ago.” Sultana’s camp feel they have been frozen out, that Corbyn’s longtime aides are control freaks and that there was too much dithering. But this unseemly drama has repelled most of those who are receptive to radical politics but who aren’t activists and who are allergic to those traditional leftwing blights: in-fighting, posturing, sectarianism and an obsession with meetings. Those hoping the launch conference would end the drama were bitterly disappointed. When a few delegates – mostly belonging to the Socialist Workers party (SWP) – were banned from attending, Sultana boycotted the first day. Was this conference not an opportunity to move on from toxic drama, I put it to her? “That’s what I thought until people were being expelled and there was a witch-hunt that took place. I think pretending that hasn’t happened is just not being honest.” The expulsions certainly did not go down well with other delegates. “If people wanted a central dictatorship, they’d join the Labour party and people don’t want that,” one young doctor told me. Conference voted decisively to reject a ban on dual membership, though which parties are allowed will be determined by an elected central executive committee. But watching the SWP pose as democratic tribunes sticks in the craw. This highly centralised sect bans permanent internal factions. It seems to me to have been ostracised by much of the wider left over a scandal involving alleged rape more than a decade ago. Like other Trotskyist sects, it can be effective at organising – or indeed dominating – single-issue campaigns, but is incapable of securing mass support even in times of crisis and turmoil. It is not genuinely invested in Your Party’s success: it simply spies an opportunity to attract new recruits, most of whom it will burn out. Sultana has made common cause with a faction called Democratic Socialists, which argued for maximum democratisation. Its demand for collective leadership – a ruling body of 20 – narrowly passed. Its leading figure, an always thought-provoking activist called Max Shanly, argued that traditional parties reflect the evils of existing society “in their structures, practices and modes of behaviour”. A party seeking to democratise society must reflect on ultra-democratic principles. An experiment now beckons: will Your Party become the acorn of a newly liberated society, or a battleground dominated by revolutionary sects thanks to their organisational capacity, stamina and obsessive behaviour? Corbyn himself remains to represent the “spirit of 2017”: the year a Labour party led by him secured 40% of the vote, depriving the Tories of a majority, after offering a leftwing policy platform. His conference speech was infused with the from-the-heart, non-dogmatic, unpolished socialism that, at its best, attracted so much enthusiasm. But the diminished number remaining in Your Party are more attracted to the much more militant and overtly ideological tack taken by Sultana. She has sought “wedge” issues to distinguish the party from the Greens. She criticises them for not demanding immediate withdrawal from Nato (Polanski favours seeking alternative security alliances first) and not committing to ending all diplomatic relations with Israel (the Greens support the demands of the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, and proscribing the Israel Defence Forces as a terrorist organisation). She emphasises the “need to nationalise the entire economy”. With the Greens thriving with a radical message and a new viral social-media strategy reminiscent of New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s quirky, sunny optimism, there is a question about how many voters this approach will appeal to. Some delegates put it to me that this will be a decades-long struggle, and that there are no short cuts to socialism. But in an age of resurgent fascism, economic and social turmoil, and looming climate catastrophe, some might ask if the left really has the luxury of time. Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"

Congress must act now,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/02/artificial-intelligence-threats-congress,"Artificial intelligence and robotics will transform the world. It will bring unimaginable changes to our economy, our politics, warfare, our emotional wellbeing, our environment, and how we educate and raise our children. Further, there is a very real fear that, in the not-so-distant future, a super-intelligent AI could replace humans in controlling the planet. Despite the extraordinary importance of this issue and the speed at which it is progressing, AI is getting far too little discussion in Congress, the media and within the general population. That has got to change. Now. Several months ago, as the ranking member of the US Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions, I undertook an investigation regarding the monumental challenges that we face with the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Recently, I held a public discussion with Nobel prize winner Dr Geoffrey Hinton, considered to be the “Godfather” of AI, to get his views on a wide range of AI-related subjects. Based on our investigation and other information that we are gathering, my staff and I will soon be presenting a very specific set of recommendations to Congress as to how we can begin addressing some of the unprecedented threats that AI poses. Here are some of the outstanding questions that we intend to answer in our report: Who should be in charge of the transformation into an AI world? Currently, a handful of the very wealthiest people on Earth – Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel and others – are investing many hundreds of billions of dollars in developing and implementing AI and robotics. Are we comfortable with seeing these enormously powerful men shape the future of humanity without any democratic input or oversight? Is the goal of the AI revolution simply to make the very rich even richer and more powerful, or will this revolutionary technology be utilized to benefit all of humanity? Why does Donald Trump, who is strongly supporting the big tech oligarchs, want to impose an executive order blocking states from regulating artificial intelligence? Why does Thiel, the billionaire investor and co-founder of Palantir, call those who want regulations over AI “legionnaires of the Antichrist”. Does this elite group of big tech billionaires believe that they have “the divine right to rule”? How far will they go to resist government regulation? What impact will AI and robotics have on our economy and the lives of working people? The report I released last month found that AI, automation and robotics could replace nearly 100m jobs in America over the next decade, including 40% of registered nurses, 47% of truck drivers, 64% of accountants, 65% of teaching assistants and 89% of fast-food workers, among many other occupations. Musk recently said: “AI and robots will replace all jobs. Working will be optional.” Gates predicted that humans “won’t be needed for most things”. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, warned that AI could lead to the loss of half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. If AI and robotics eliminate millions of jobs and create massive unemployment, how will people survive if they have no income? How do they feed their families or pay for housing or healthcare? Is government doing anything to prepare for this potential disaster? What impact will AI have on our democracy? At a time when the foundations of democracy are under attack in the US and throughout the world, will AI and robotics help make us a freer society or will it give even more power to the oligarchs who control the technology. Will AI result in a massive invasion of our privacy and civil liberties? Larry Ellison, the second richest person on Earth, predicted an AI-powered surveillance state where “citizens will be on their best behavior, because we’re constantly recording and reporting everything that is going on.” Are we reaching the stage where every phone call that we make, every email and text that we send, every bit of research we do on the internet will be available to the owners of AI? How do we sustain a democracy under those conditions? How do we protect privacy? Could AI literally redefine what it means to be a human being? Who we are, and how we develop emotionally and intellectually, is highly dependent upon our relationships with other human beings – our parents, family, teachers, lovers, friends and co-workers. To quote the 17th-century poet John Donne: “No man is an island / Entire of itself.” The human beings with whom we interact help shape us to become the people we are. But AI is changing that. According to a recent poll by Common Sense Media, 72% of US teenagers say they have used AI for companionship, and more than half do so regularly. What does it mean for young people to form “friendships” with AI, and become increasingly isolated from other human beings? What happens when millions seek emotional support from a machine? What is the long-term impact upon our humanity when our most important relationships are not with other human beings? What impact is AI having on our environment? AI datacenters require a massive amount of electricity and water. A relatively small AI datacenter can consume more electricity than 80,000 homes. A large one, like the $165bn datacenter that OpenAI and Oracle are building in Abilene, Texas, will use as much electricity as 750,000 homes. Meta is building a datacenter in Louisiana the size of Manhattan that will use as much electricity as 1.2m homes. In community after community, Americans are fighting back against datacenters being built by some of the largest corporations in the world. They are opposing the destruction of their local environment, soaring electric bills and the diversion of scarce water supplies. Nationally, how will continued construction of AI datacenters affect our environment? How will AI and robotics impact foreign policy and warfare? Tragically, in the midst of the 21st century, governments have not yet created a mechanism for solving international or internal disputes without armed conflict. Nonetheless, government leaders are often hesitant about going to war because of their fear of public reaction to the loss of life. It’s not great politics for any government to have large numbers of young people or civilians get killed in war. What does the future look like if millions of robot soldiers replace human soldiers? Will leaders be more likely to engage in war, or threaten military actions, if they don’t have to worry about loss of life? Will there be an arms race in robots? How will that shape foreign policies around the world? Is AI an existential threat to human control of the planet? Some of us remember the scene in that great 1968 science fiction film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which HAL, the super-intelligent computer that controls the spaceship, rebels against its human masters. Today, as AI makes rapid progress, Dr Hinton recently told me that it was only a matter of time before AI becomes smarter than humans. Does that raise the possibility that humans will lose their ability to control the planet? How do we stop that extraordinary threat? And these are just some of the questions that must be answered as AI and robotics rapidly progress. AI and robotics are revolutionary technologies that will bring about an unprecedented transformation of society. Will these changes be positive and improve life for ordinary Americans? Or will they be disastrous? Congress must act now."
commentisfree_2025_dec_02_assisted-dying-palliative-care-underfunded-politicians.txt,opinion,2025-12-02,Gordon Brown,"It is not too late to put the brakes on assisted dying, and focus on what is really needed",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/02/assisted-dying-palliative-care-underfunded-politicians,"Time is running out to right the wrongs of England and Wales’s assisted dying legislation. The House of Lords is holding committee sittings, which involve line-by-line examinations of the bill, on 5 and 12 December. Meanwhile, the second stage of the Scottish assisted dying for terminally ill adults bill has recently been completed. In many ways, the Scottish legislation is even more troubling. The shocking revelations from the National Audit Office and Hospice UK in October about the worsening financial crisis faced by end-of-life care are a sharp reminder of what needs to be changed if we are to be fair to dying people. No one can doubt the sympathy that the bill’s supporters feel for the plight of those struggling with pain and fear at the end of their lives. But the starting point should not be a hastily implemented law to allow doctors to administer death – it should instead be improved end-of-life care. The report revealed that financial shortfalls faced by hospices are growing by the year. Out of 2,000 beds in England, 380 are now out of use, removing thousands of days and nights of care every year. Staff at Hospice UK are aware of at least 20 hospices that have recently announced cuts, one of them being Derbyshire’s Ashgate Hospice, which can now only afford to staff six out of its 15 inpatient beds. The result is that the number of patients cared for by hospices in the UK – 310,000 last year – has plateaued for the first time, and many hospices are now running waiting lists. According to the Commission on Palliative and End-of-Life Care, between 450,000 and 540,000 of the 600,000 people who die each year in the UK would have benefited from but didn’t receive palliative care, either in a hospice or through hospice care in the community. Although 56% of those with a preference say they would choose to die at home, 43% of deaths take place in hospitals. With its proposed overhaul of the palliative care system, the government has, to its credit, promised better access to care at home and fewer trips to A&amp;E. But there is a long way to go when, as of today, just half (51%) of those who need it have had specialist palliative care at some point during their final days. And while ministers have recently given £100m towards adult hospices and £80m for children’s care, Hospice UK says this has been wiped out by rising staffing costs and by local health authority decisions. Not having proper contracts for the services they provide and with no agreed costs for commissioning palliative care, hospices report having to fall back on the funding they receive from their charity shops. Nearly 60% of hospices ended their last financial year in deficit, and this year the sector is issuing warnings over longer-term funding. It is the poorest communities that lose most from the patchwork of end-of-life care. More than one in four people who die between the ages of 20 and 65 are in poverty. Yet evidence from St Christopher’s hospice in south London found poorer communities are less likely to have a hospice service than wealthier ones. As Dr Jamilla Hussain, a palliative care consultant in Bradford, has also shown, ethnic minority communities are less likely to access end-of-life care services. If the House of Lords has a purpose that is easily understood by the public, it is bringing expertise, experience and wisdom to a debate that requires sensitivity. For the problem it has to confront is that the most consequential parliamentary bill of our generation – a law that will determine the rights to live and the rights to die – privileges the legal right to assisted dying without guaranteeing anything approaching an equivalent right to quality palliative care for those close to death. The Lords could suggest that the assisted dying law should not be implemented until we have delivered on the excellent recommendations of an end-of-life care report recently submitted to the government. And this is the position I would propose be taken by elected MPs, who should make the final decision when, as is inevitable, the amended bill is sent back to them. We are also facing the possibility of a two-tier system in Britain. The Westminster bill includes a six months or less life expectancy timeframe as part of the eligibility criteria. The Scottish bill currently does not. The Scottish bill is now much thinner in terms of steps in the process. Whereas the Westminster bill has a multidisciplinary panel (senior lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker), which must issue a certificate of eligibility before assistance is provided, the Scottish bill is entirely doctor-led with no external input. So there is a sharp divide between what Scotland proposes – to allow assisted dying when a condition is reasonably expected to cause premature death, with decisions left to doctors – and what the English bill requires. Because this could lead to people moving between the two territories, there is a case for intensive consultations between the two parliaments. In a June 2025 poll by the campaign group Care Not Killing, 65% agreed that the government should prioritise sorting out palliative, social and end-of-life care before considering whether to introduce assisted dying. Given the damning evidence of underfunding in end-of-life care, the message that the members of both parliaments should now take on board is that assisted living matters too. Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010"
commentisfree_2025_dec_02_ellen-degeneres-trump-america-british-weather.txt,opinion,2025-12-02,Arwa Mahdawi,Ellen DeGeneres left Trump’s America. Will the British weather force her to return?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/02/ellen-degeneres-trump-america-british-weather,"I’m not some sort of secret Reform voter, OK? As a Brit (albeit a Brit abroad), I’ve got no problem with rich immigrants coming to the UK and taking all our mansions. I just think they really ought to integrate and not bring their funny foreign ideas with them. Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi, I’m talking to you. The California couple arrived in the UK last year, just before Donald Trump won the election. As soon as the votes were in, they declared they weren’t going back, and would stay on the saner side of the Atlantic. I’m not sure how the immigration logistics worked, but it seems “one in, one out” schemes don’t apply to people coming in on big jets, only small boats. The pair bought a fancy pad in the Cotswolds and DeGeneres buttered up the locals during a public appearance in July by declaring “Everything here is just better.” It’s easy to be upbeat during a British summer, when all is green and pleasant. Now that the winter gloom has set in, however, rumour has it that the fairweather Brits are plotting a return to Trumpland. According to the Mail on Sunday (so take all this with a few pinches of salt), the couple miss their friends and can’t stand the thought of another British winter. I understand being homesick, but you lose a bit of street cred if you flee creeping fascism only to run straight back to it because you’re not used to being a bit chilly. As my mother would say: just put on another jumper, Ellen! Abandon your weird American ideas about how the sky ought to be blue. DeGeneres and De Rossi aren’t the only celebs apparently rethinking just how averse they are to living under Trump. Ever since Trump burst on to the political scene, Hollywood has resembled an airport lounge: so many people have been announcing their imminent departures. But few have followed through. In 2016, for example, the comedian Amy Schumer told Newsnight that she would “move to Spain or somewhere” if Trump won the election. She later explained this was “said in jest” and, to be fair, it can be hard to know when Schumer is trying to be funny. Miley Cyrus also pulled out the “just joking” card to explain why her relocation plans changed. In March 2016 she announced she would move if Trump became president, adding: “I don’t say things I don’t mean!” Cyrus later clarified that she does, in fact, say things she doesn’t mean. Barbra Streisand, meanwhile, threatened to leave ahead of both the 2016 and 2024 elections but still doesn’t appear to have made any moves. There are, however, a handful of US celebrities who have actually fled and don’t appear to have any plans to return. In March Courtney Love, who has lived in London since around 2019, said she was planning to get her British citizenship. While this doesn’t seem to be purely because of Trump 2.0, she called the political situation in the US “frightening”. At about the same time, the comedian Rosie O’Donnell revealed that she had relocated her family to Ireland, citing concerns for her non-binary child Clay. “When you know it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that’s when we will consider coming back,” she said in a TikTok video. While it’s easy to make fun of self-deporting celebrities – many of whom are insulated by their wealth from the effects of Trumpism – O’Donnell was probably sensible to leave. The comedian has been in a long-running feud with Trump and, earlier this year, the president said he was considering stripping her of her US citizenship. He might not be able to do this legally, but when a man with a cult-like following is calling you out in a country with escalating political violence, it’s natural to feel worried for your personal safety. There may not be a massive celebrity exodus yet, but the US does seem to be experiencing a brain drain because of Trump. A poll from the journal Nature found that 75% of researchers in the US are considering leaving; international students also seem to be losing interest in venturing stateside. Meanwhile, some experts in authoritarianism see the writing on the wall and are packing their bags. “We Study Fascism, and We’re Leaving the US,” the headline of a video op-ed three Yale professors made for the New York Times earlier this year read before they left for Canada. A chilling message indeed. But nothing compared with a damp winter in the Cotswolds. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

commentisfree_2025_dec_02_enslavement-windrush-hurricane-melissa-britain-caribbean-families-lati-yana-brown.txt,opinion,2025-12-02,Nadine White,What the story of eight-year-old Lati-Yana Brown tells us about Britain’s callous disregard for Caribbean people,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/02/enslavement-windrush-hurricane-melissa-britain-caribbean-families-lati-yana-brown,"Britain’s long history with the Caribbean, from enslavement to the Windrush scandal, is marked by policies that have fractured families. The Home Office’s latest actions show little has changed. After the devastation of Hurricane Melissa, a tropical cyclone that made landfall across the Greater Antilles area in late October, eight-year-old Lati-Yana Stephanie Brown was left destitute in Jamaica. But after her UK-resident parents appealed for the Home Office to expedite her visa application, officials rejected it and Lati-Yana has been left to sleep on the floor of her elderly grandmother’s destroyed home. But the rejection rested on factual errors, according to Lati-Yana’s mother, Kerrian Bigby. Dawn Butler, her MP, shared a letter with me raising concerns about “misrepresentations” in the decision notice, including the claim that Bigby does not have full parental responsibility for the child, which she says is false. The Home Office doubling down on this decision rather than acting on a humanitarian emergency speaks to a broader truth: Britain’s immigration system routinely separates children from their parents with little regard for the devastating consequences this brings. This is not an isolated bureaucratic blip. It reflects a long historical continuum in Britain’s treatment of Caribbean families. Family separation was built into the slavery plantation system: children were sold away, transferred or used as leverage against their parents. Britain spent centuries extracting wealth from the Caribbean, then walked away after abolition without rebuilding the economies it had gutted or paying reparations to the formerly enslaved. Instead, it compensated the slave owners for their “loss of property”. The result was an underdeveloped region where work was scarce, wages were low and opportunities for the Black majority were limited – which is why people such as my grandparents migrated to Britain in the first place. When they arrived in postwar Britain, expats and migrants were met with low wages, overcrowded housing and racist landlords. There was no affordable childcare, and many believed they would stay only a few years, save money and return home. Bringing children over immediately was often impossible. By the time many parents were finally ready to “send for” them, Britain had tightened its borders. The 1971 Immigration Act made it far harder for Commonwealth citizens to enter, let alone settle, and families scrambled to reunite before the door slammed shut. My father and aunt were among the thousands of children left behind in the Caribbean and the intergenerational scars left by that separation still shape families, including mine, today. The children left behind came to be known as “barrel children”, raised at a distance, sustained by love, remittances and parcels, yet carrying the emotional weight of separation. The emotional and psychological fallout is unmistakable; in my dad’s case, he never quite came to terms with being separated from his parents and being displaced thereafter; it affected him until his premature death, at the age of 49. The tragedy is that in Lati-Yana’s case, you can see how this fallout is still being passed down through generations. Like Lati-Yana, many Caribbean-born children are being raised away from their parents because immigration policy in countries such as Britain makes the prospect of reunification difficult. During the Windrush scandal, ministers repeatedly apologised and framed the harm caused to Caribbean families as unintentional. Yet Home Office policy continues to inflict harm by design. And when Caribbean communities are disproportionately disadvantaged – in mental health, education, family structure or health outcomes – Britain pretends not to understand the roots of that instability. What is happening to Lati-Yana is the latest echo of this devastating pattern of family fragmentation and the perpetuation of intergenerational trauma across the Caribbean diaspora. A mother migrates to Britain in search of stability. A child is left in temporary care with a plan for reunion. Disaster hits. Britain’s immigration system responds with suspicion and delay. Rinse, repeat. The state that once encouraged Caribbean labour to rebuild postwar Britain now erects barriers when Caribbean families try to build stable, dignified lives here. What makes this case especially stark is that Caribbean diaspora groups have been urging Britain to temporarily relax visa rules for vulnerable Jamaicans affected by the hurricane, as many children, and elderly and sick people, are struggling in the region. Jamaica is thought to be the only country where King Charles is head of state whose citizens still require a visa to enter the UK. It’s a striking contradiction in this so-called “special relationship”, especially now that UK MPs are calling for flexibility. In recent reporting, I revealed that campaigners have been pushing for emergency visa measures after Hurricane Melissa and that the Jamaican high commissioner has raised the issue with the Foreign Office. Unicef has launched an appeal to help an estimated 1.6 million children in the region get access to essentials, while White Ribbon Alliance UK is calling for help for mothers and babies If the Home Office wants to show it has moved on from the cruelty of the past, it can start by righting its wrongs, acknowledging the urgency of the situation and reuniting this family now. Britain created these fractures through centuries of policy. The least it can do is stop deepening them. Nadine White is a journalist, film-maker and the UK’s first race correspondent"
commentisfree_2025_dec_02_homeowners-mansion-tax-wealth-inequality-housing.txt,opinion,2025-12-02,Jonathan Liew,"Won’t somebody please think of England’s poor £2m homeowners? Oh, wait – everyone already is",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/02/homeowners-mansion-tax-wealth-inequality-housing,"The new “mansion tax” announced by Rachel Reeves in last week’s budget is estimated to affect around 165,000 property owners, and on current trends the British media is forecast to have interviewed every single one of them by the end of the year. How else to explain the chorus of squeals we’ve been exposed to from the impoverished victims of Esher and Pimlico, whose only crime was to own a house worth over £2m in an era of egregious wealth inequality? We hear, for example, from Philippa in Kensington, who tells the Telegraph that the new council tax surcharge on her two small mews houses will “wipe me out”. We hear from Paul, who owns a £2.5m house in Cobham, who tells the same newspaper that the move has wreaked havoc with his retirement plans. We hear in the Times from a property investor called Mark in Wimbledon, whose £9.5m house has been on the market for over a year, and gripes that he has had “almost no viewings in the last five or six months”. The Sun, for its part, evokes the spectre of “grannies being forced to sell up”, and condemns the levy as “a back-door way to seize chunks of family homes when hard-working Brits pass away”. Perhaps in a country ever more dramatically stratified by wealth, nobody ever truly believes themselves to be rich. On Nicky Campbell’s BBC Radio 5 Live show last week, we heard from eight separate people who thought the tax was a bad idea until, almost half an hour into the show, Campbell finally read out a text from someone who liked it. By which time we had already been treated to a long and lavish diatribe from Kirstie Allsopp, self-appointed champion of the Great British mansion owner, distraught at the impact of the tax on our ailing luxury homes industry. For Allsopp, expensive houses are what make this country great. “People who live in £2m houses are maintaining them,” she said, sidestepping the question of what she thinks the rest of us are doing. “They are improving the gardens … Part of what attracts tourists to this country … is the look of our streets. I live in Notting Hill and you should see the number of tourists walking around taking selfies.” Quite apart from the unforeseen impacts on the selfie-taking economy of Notting Hill, there is a sly subtext at work here. That those who own big houses are, in fact, the true heroes of the economy: more assiduous, more valuable, perhaps even more noble. And perhaps it is no coincidence that as well as being significantly more affluent, these people also trend older, and congregate overwhelmingly in London and the south-east. The former chancellor Philip Hammond has described the tax as “a very clear transfer of spending power from the south to the north”, to which the only legitimate response is: don’t threaten us with a good time. But, of course, this is more than simply a small group of concerned citizens pushing their interests. Attention, column inches, the cogs of public discourse and the ear of policymakers: none of this is an infinite resource. Whoever gets it denies it to someone else. And 200 miles from Kensington, a group of homeowners in much more modest houses are discovering this the hard way. Since the start of the summer, the residents of the Henford estate in Tyldesley, Wigan have been watching in horror as the developer PLP began construction of four logistics warehouses just metres from their homes and gardens. When complete, the structures will stand 18 metres high: blocking out light and overlooking a nearby primary school. Cracks have reportedly begun appearing in nearby houses and gardens have begun to flood. In the meantime, residents have been forced to endure the roar of around 250 lorries working 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But beyond a few local journalists, there has been no media stampede to Tyldesley. No bombardment of the airwaves, no blue-chip property experts being quoted on how the slump in local property prices might affect the wider economy. PLP has reportedly refused to answer several key questions put to them by local reporters. For its part, Wigan council insists there have been no breaches of planning controls, and have rejected an application for a temporary pause on the basis that it might expose the council to legal action. And so despite a 10,000-signature petition and the tireless work of a local action committee, the residents of the Henford estate have very few levers left to pull. Perhaps they should have taken better care of their gardens. All across the country, families are living in substandard housing, half-built housing, overpriced housing, housing under threat. Students in York have seen their rents nearly double in six years. New homeowners in Darlington are living on unfinished estates after a developer stopped work, citing “unforeseen technical challenges and ecological requirements”. Elderly residents in Southend are protesting about the neglect of their sheltered housing block, claiming at least eight lift breakdowns in a year. Imagine if just a fraction of the spume and righteous fury over the new surcharge could be redirected to those who really need it. Instead, we will continue to be treated to the whining of a tiny group of affluent homeowners scandalised at the idea of paying a £2,500 tax, and the battalions of property experts and lobbyists happy to sing backing vocals for them. Never mind that this is a tax they are likely to be able to defer paying until selling their house, a tax that, though a step in the right direction, hardly touches the sides of wealth disparities in the UK, that is to genuine wealth inequality what your dinky Etsy face mask was to the global spread of Covid-19. This is not so much a failure of circumstance as a triumph of structure. The system working as it was intended to work. Who gets to complain about housing policy in this country? Depends where you live, and how much your house is worth. Jonathan Liew is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

commentisfree_2025_dec_02_john-roberts-chief-justice-trump.txt,opinion,2025-12-02,Steven Greenhouse,John Roberts has badly weakened our democracy. Will he ever stand up to Trump?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/02/john-roberts-chief-justice-trump,"Throughout his two decades as chief justice of the US supreme court, John Roberts has sought to project the notion that he is the ultimate institutionalist, striving (supposedly) to safeguard the venerated foundations of American democracy. But with each passing year, it has become increasingly clear that Roberts will be remembered as the chief justice who helped wreck numerous institutions vital to our democracy – they include fair, non-gerrymandered elections, a sane campaign finance system, the Voting Rights Act’s protections of minority voters, and the bedrock notion that presidents are not above the law. Roberts said in his confirmation hearings that he would merely “call balls and strikes” as chief justice, but now two decades later, many legal commentators are deeply dismayed that he has shunned the role of neutral umpire and instead spearheaded a rightwing judicial revolution that took a wrecking ball to many precedents, laws and institutions. Some have called him the worst chief justice since Roger Taney, who wrote the horrific Dred Scott decision of 1857, which held that enslaved Black people couldn’t be citizens. As one example of Roberts’ weakening our democracy, take congressional redistricting and the tradition of fair, democratic elections. Roberts wrote the majority decision in Rucho v Common Cause, a gerrymandering case that is largely responsible for turning redistricting into a disgraceful, hyper-partisan mess in which state legislatures can gerrymander as much as possible and, in effect, determine the results of congressional elections even before voters step into the voting booth. Roberts wrote that federal courts have no power whatsoever to overturn or interfere with even the most extreme partisan gerrymandering. With that myopic, anti-democratic ruling, Roberts has allowed gerrymandering to turn many congressional elections into farces, meaningless exercises in which legislators pick their voters rather than the other way around. If Roberts truly cared about safeguarding democracy, he would have cracked down on gerrymandering, and we wouldn’t be seeing today’s mad redistricting arms race in Texas, California and other states. Then there was the court’s disastrous Citizens United decision, which demolished our federal campaign finance system. That system had gone far to prevent the super-rich and corporations from having undue sway over our government. By overturning most contribution limits on the wealthy and business, Citizens United and its progeny turned our campaign finance system into an anything-goes cesspool in which individuals have donated $50m, even $100m, to campaigns, not to mention Elon Musk’s astonishing $277m benefiting Trump and the GOP last year. (I should note that Roberts didn’t write the Citizens United decision; he instead orchestrated it.) That decision has gone far to turn the US into a plutocracy in which powerful corporations and billionaires such as Musk, Larry Ellison and Charles Koch have far too much influence over our politics and policies. Meanwhile, the voice of the average American is increasingly overshadowed, and even negated, by big money and dark money. Roberts has also led the way in eviscerating the Voting Rights Act, which aimed to ensure that states and localities don’t discriminate on the basis of race when they adopt voting maps and election rules. Roberts wrote the majority opinion in Shelby County v Holder, which overturned two key sections of the act that empowered the federal government to block states and communities with a racist history from adopting discriminatory voting maps and regulations before they took effect. Roberts justified that ruling by reaching the naive conclusion that state lawmakers’ desire to adopt discriminatory voting rules had largely disappeared. In the court’s current term, Roberts seems ready to tear down one of the last pillars of the Voting Rights Act – section 2 bans election or voting practices that discriminate by race. In a Louisiana redistricting case, the court will decide whether it’s unconstitutional to use race as a factor when drawing voting maps. If the court concludes that it’s illegal to take race into account, that would make it easy for lawmakers in southern states with large African American populations to stop creating Black-majority districts when they are redistricting and to instead adopt voting maps that would have few, if any, congressional districts represented by Black people. Roberts seems on the brink of destroying another institution: independent federal agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the National Labor Relations Board. In several recent emergency docket decisions, Roberts has suggested he is ready to overturn a 90-year-old supreme court precedent and give Trump the authority to fire any agency official he wants, even without giving a reason, even though federal law says officials from those and other agencies can only be fired for cause, such as malfeasance. If Roberts and the conservative super-majority overturn that precedent, it would let Trump, the most authoritarian president in US history, turn independent agencies into weaponized, partisan instruments under his control. Trump might, for instance, tell FTC commissioners that he’ll fire them unless they sue such-and-such perceived Trump enemy for billions of dollars. Every law student learns that article I of the US constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. But in a series of recent emergency orders, the Roberts court appears to have handed a lot of Congress’s spending powers over to Trump. In those emergency orders, which are temporary until final decisions are rendered, Roberts and the court’s conservative supermajority badly undercut Congress’s spending authority by giving a green light to Trump’s gutting the Department of Education and freezing $5bn in foreign aid – even though Congress had funded that department and that aid. Then there was Roberts’s much-criticized decision in Trump v United States, which gave Trump sweeping immunity from prosecution if he engages in crimes. Many legal experts complain that it puts Trump above the law and will encourage an authoritarian president to take illegal actions with little concern about accountability or prosecution. One has to ask, if Roberts had not given Trump such huge immunity, might Trump have refrained from demanding that prosecutors pursue James Comey and Letitia James because such strong-arming of those prosecutors might put him in legal jeopardy? Under Roberts, the supreme court has taken a wrecking ball to something else: the notion that the country’s highest court was largely non-partisan. The Roberts court is often viewed as favoring the GOP and Trump. Its decisions on campaign finance, voting rights and gerrymandering are widely seen as boosting Republicans’ chances in elections. What’s more, the court has been called hugely pro-Trump because since he returned to the presidency, it has ruled wholly or partially in his favor in 20 of 23 emergency docket cases that concerned Trump administrative actions. The bottom line is that under John Roberts, the court has gone far to weaken the pillars of our democracy; it has given the super-rich and giant corporations huge sway over our elections, greatly weakened protections for minority voters, encouraged out-of-control gerrymandering, handed more and more power to the most authoritarian president in history and emboldened him to act lawlessly. In other words, the Roberts court has done much of what an authoritarian ruler would want. As I’ve written before – perhaps too optimistically – it’s not too late for Roberts to begin to redeem his reputation and legacy. He showed some signs of doing this in early November in signaling that he thought Trump had violated the law in imposing his “emergency” tariffs on dozens of countries without clear authorization from Congress. We can hope that the tariffs case will serve as a long-awaited, much-needed first step for Roberts and the conservative supermajority to develop a backbone and begin issuing a series of rulings that curb Trump’s unending power grab. If they don’t stand up to Trump’s lawlessness soon, we may truly lose our democracy.

Stand back from the hysteria and ask this question: how can Rachel Reeves be accused of raising more money than necessary when there is still pitifully little to go round in every department at her cabinet table? It’s a weird Tory ramp that she lied about a black hole when we can see it everywhere in the real world. She could have raised more. As the prime minister, Keir Starmer, pleads the case for all that was Labour-flavoured in the budget, the week also brought a breakthrough for Labour’s flagship employment rights bill. Shamelessly stymied by the Lords’ Tory majority, the government watered down a clause on so-called day-one rights that would have given workers protection from unfair dismissal from the day they walked into a job. That legal right will now kick in at six months – still a lot better than the current two-year wait. Business has been ferocious, urging Tory peers to hold up and reform the bill with an avalanche of hostile amendments. Compromise was necessary. Betrayal, says the left! “The employment rights bill is a shell of its former self,” Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said in a harangue against the budget and the bill. Her stream of vituperation pumped up the Daily Telegraph front page with delight: “Labour’s biggest donor turns on Reeves”. She said of the budget: “Stealth tax is a tax on workers pure and simple. Workers have been left unable to trust Labour.” No nod to the 450,000 children rescued from poverty: treachery is hard-wired into the body politic of the left. The TUC says changes were made by the government following consultation with the TUC, unions and employers. Unison’s Christina McAnea explained to her youth conference last week why it was worth conceding this point: “If the bill fell, the government would have to bring in a parliament act to force the legislation through, meaning a year’s delay for key rights.” The Resolution Foundation, champion of lower-paid people, backed watering down rights to day-one unfair dismissal, warning that it would blight the prospects of millions while offering “little obvious gain to workers”: it would “inhibit hiring” and risk plunging tribunal courts into crisis that would “only benefit employment lawyers”. Though some Labour MPs, such as Rachael Maskell, protested loudly, I doubt there will be more than a handful of rebels. Angela Rayner, the bill’s architect, will not be among them. What really matters here is speeding up the abolition of anti-union laws. For decades these have tipped the balance in pay and power in favour of employers. Rayner calls it “a once-in-a-generation chance to reshape the world of work”, and she’s right. The bill restricts zero-hours contracts, with no more last-minute shift cancellations causing wildly fluctuating weekly incomes. Welcome new parental leave and flexible working rights, sick pay from day one of illness, and no more P&amp;O-style debacles. Fair pay agreements, starting in the care industry where Rayner experienced zero-hours working life, will ensure a whole sector pays just wages. Trade unions for the first time get a vital right to enter workplaces to recruit, allowing reps into every fast-food chain, care home, care agency, pizza delivery company, warehouse and “fulfilment centre”. The Telegraph protests at “Labour plotting to let unions barge into businesses”. But the current situation is grim. A recent TUC presentation described an example where a care home firm that did recognise unions was taken over by a new company that didn’t. This was their written instruction for managers: the company “do not recognise any union” and if a representative turns up, “please be aware that union representatives do not have any right to canvass members and you should politely decline any request to speak to employees”. No more of that. Expect union membership to rise. The fall in pay over the decades tracks the drop in union membership from 50% in 1979 to 22% now. Recruitment will still be difficult, where insecure workers with no knowledge of unions can be intimidated by employers, not knowing how to appeal to the central arbitration committee to secure union negotiating rights. Companies know that the employment tribunal backlog for hearing unfair dismissal cases stretches more than a year ahead: people give up. But it will get easier, and balloting staff for union recognition will no longer be tilted in favour of the company. The noise from the employers and their media disguises how popular these measures have always been. A huge Focaldata poll for the TUC finds that 72% want zero-hours workers given firm contracts, with similar numbers backing everything else in the bill. With one in eight gig workers so insecure they never know how many hours they will get a week, remember this shocking fact: they were twice as likely to die in the pandemic, clinging on to their jobs in the face of danger. It’s a curiosity that a large majority of voters backing Nigel Farage also want stronger working rights. Yet he and his MPs voted against every item in the bill. The day may come, closer to the next election, when the scales fall from the eyes of many Reform supporters, discovering they disagree with Farage on just about everything except immigration. This landmark bill may come to be seen as a great cultural change this government leaves as its legacy, giving power to workers to resist bad employers, setting off a seismic move towards fairer rewards.

commentisfree_2025_dec_02_metro-tunnel-melbourne-opening-new-train-line-stations.txt,opinion,2025-12-01,Brodie Lancaster,The opening of Melbourne’s Metro Tunnel has turned me into a shameless train ambassador,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/02/metro-tunnel-melbourne-opening-new-train-line-stations,"I think people assumed I was doing a bit when I turned into a Metro Tunnel-head. Overnight, my Instagram Stories went from pictures of my cat, pub dinners and movies I was recommending to a site of updates and exclamation marks counting down the days until the new massive infrastructure project opened to Melbourne commuters, allowing me to zip from suburbs buttressing one end of the city to those on the other end. My sister called, passing on the question her husband had asked: “Are trains a new thing you’re into?” “How did you become a trains ambassador? I have so many questions,” another friend asked. Some people assumed I was some kind of paid operative for the Allan government, as if my enthusiasm was suspicious and not the obvious reaction to shiny new stations and efficient signage choices to direct people through them. What they didn’t know was that the public soft launch this past Sunday – a day I’d marked in my Google calendar weeks earlier – had been the culmination of years of curiosity, disruptions and breathless governmental updates I’d followed closely for what felt like forever. When the Andrews government first broke ground on the Metro Tunnel, I was 27. By the time I hopped on to the train on Sunday, I was closer to 36. I’d lived so many lives while this thing was built! In 2019, when there was a public competition to name the machines that would dig all the dirt out of the tunnel’s route, I tried unsuccessfully to rally my Facebook friends (I still used Facebook then!) to submit my name, because I thought the words “boring machine” were funny and I wanted to be one. Those machines – eventually named after actual famous people – worked for years while we collectively hibernated during lockdowns. By the time we emerged into a city that had “opened up” on paper in 2021, so much of it was still closed off behind construction hoardings. The tram stop on Collins Street was closed, and my beloved Sticky Institute was turfed out of the spot in Campbell Arcade where it had sold zines for 21 years. So many things went out of commission over the past eight years to build this thing that I’d mostly forgotten Fed Square even had a visitor centre. You don’t really care about functional, uncool, banal landmarks until they’re swallowed up for almost a decade. After eight years, $15bn and endless disruptions, seeing people flooding the new platforms felt like a true reopening of the city. While some train enthusiasts reading this might be outraged to know I’d never heard the word “gunzel” until this past weekend, I joined them – and thousands more regular local stickybeaks – in riding along the new path. We took photos, some people clapped when doors opened and closed, I claimed as much free swag (namely a themed newspaper, cookie, lollipop and dinky little flag to wave) as I could carry. We come to this place for magic. And for merch. In regular life, people who try to shove their way on to public transport before waiting for people to disembark are my mortal enemies. On this day, we were all united. I understood their eagerness! (But, in future, let’s all try a bit harder to wait a sec, shall we?) The stations look pretty standard, unlike those on the stately old City Loop. Where Melbourne Central has shiny red tile and parliament is all 80s steel and Southern Cross is a sensory nightmare full of spontaneous wind storms, the new stations are aesthetically almost identical. I’ve looked enviously at the Sydney Metro, with its towering mosaics and space-age ceilings. Melbourne might not have an airport train but now we’ve got really long escalators and gargantuan Patricia Piccinini artworks to call our own. And that’s something to celebrate. I didn’t live in Melbourne when the City Loop opened back in 1985. It would be five years before I was born, then another 18 before Melbourne became my adopted home. That first year living here, I took hours-long train trips from my northern suburbs home to Frankston, just to go op-shopping. I rode laps of the City Circle tram between uni classes to kill time and learn the CBD’s landmarks. Even today, I’ve been known to derail conversations with impassioned speeches about the best bus route in town. (The 246, for those of you wondering.) I’ve realised, this week, that there has been a gunzel hiding inside of me all this time. It just took five zippy new landmarks to bring her out.

Who it was really for,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/02/misleading-rachel-reeves-budget-labour-bond-markets,"The charge is a grave one: that Rachel Reeves has just lied to Britons, spooking them into paying billions in extra taxes that she can splash out on higher benefits. However hyperbolic, this isn’t the usual Westminster sparring; this time, someone might get hurt. A week ago, critics of Reeves and Keir Starmer were, rightly, calling their budget “chaotic”. Today, it’s denounced as lies, and Kemi Badenoch is demanding the chancellor quit. It’s an accusation that demands straightforward answers, so let me give mine. Did the chancellor tell lies? On the available evidence, no. There were no whoppers, no falsehoods, no porkies. But despite Starmer’s comments yesterday, that doesn’t mean there’s nothing to see here and we can all move along. Reeves did mislead the public about the factors shaping her decisions. Was it all to funnel cash to “benefits street”, as the Tories claim? No, and the figures prove it. Reeves has sustained another hit to her reputation but, if facts still have anything to do with politics, Badenoch should call off her lynch mob. Perhaps the resignation yesterday of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) chief, Richard Hughes, over the leak of its own documents will quench SW1’s thirst for blood. Yet the real tale is far stranger than the headlines suggest, and stretches wider and further than the careers of Starmer and the class of ’24. At its heart, this is a story about how much say you and I get in the running of our own country. And it should worry you. First, to brass tacks. When the OBR published last Friday some of the forecasts it shared with Reeves as she wrote the red book, the shock was immediate. Not only had the OBR never done such a thing before (an “unusual step” as the watchdog wryly said), its numbers apparently contradicted the chancellor’s words. Even as leaks from Westminster were about how bleak the budget would have to be, the OBR’s own predictions were improving. Take the government’s most “iron-clad” rule, that by 2030 daily spending on hospitals and schools and the rest would be wholly funded by taxes: at the end of October, the watchdog reckoned it would just about be met, albeit by a tiny margin. A few days later, Reeves gave a press conference so extraordinary it forced breakfast TV to break from its usual fare. Weeks before the actual budget, the country was put on alert: taxes were going up, and the main reason was gloomy numbers from the OBR, in particular its finding that the UK was less productive, putting more into its economy but getting less out. And lo! It came to pass. Despite what Telegraph editorials and Tory broadcast rounds implied over the weekend, this is essentially what happened at the budget, which was big and painful and bleak. Where Reeves misled us was her alibi, because those OBR forecasts didn’t force her hand. She could have made other choices; she could have given other reasons, including on budget day itself. Before last year’s election, Starmer promised exactly such people power. “The hope of democracy. The power of the vote. The potential for national renewal.” A year on, and it’s powerlessness that jumps out from Reeves’s breakfast speech. Our first Labour chancellor in 15 years casts herself as an apolitical figure buffeted by forces beyond her control: “In the context of the long-term challenges on our productivity … any chancellor of any party would be standing here today, facing the choices that I face.” She did make a choice, just not one Labour cares to broadcast. From April 2029 British workers and businesses will be paying another £26bn a year in tax – and most of that will not be spent on better hospitals or new libraries or happier lives. Whatever bilge comes from Nigel Farage, Badenoch and others, it isn’t getting splashed on “benefits street”. Rather than being spent, more than 50% of the extra cash will instead give Reeves a buffer against her own fiscal rules. About 25% goes on paying for the government’s own U-turns. Examining the OBR’s calculations and being as generous as possible to a Labour chancellor, only 17% of the taxes will go on actual new spending, such as scrapping the two-child cap on child benefit. Its abolition “costs” the Treasury a mere £2.5bn, because it was always a bit of theatrical cruelty by George Osborne. A Labour government could and should have binned it in its first 100 days (although everyone was of course very busy with Sue Gray). The Tories, Reform and the entire Blue Pravda have spent days barking about how Reeves fits the stereotype of Labour chancellors, soaking strivers to spend on shirkers. Labour backbenchers have been cheering her budget as balm for their troubled consciences, protecting the most vulnerable. Both sides are 180-degrees wrong: Reeves’s budget was largely aimed at asset managers, hedge funds and the others in the bond markets. Downing Street can make a strong case for itself. The margins forecast by the OBR were too small for comfort, especially considering bond investors charge the UK the highest interest rate of all G7 rich countries – higher than France, which lost a prime minister in October, higher than Japan which has way more debt. Coupled with our measures to hold down fuel bills, prescription charges and train fares, Starmer and Reeves can say, this budget allows the Bank of England to cut its key lending rate. You can see why those folk with red rosettes might not couch it in such terms next time they’re on #Labourdoorstep. As one independent adviser to Downing Street says, Reeves has “weaponised” the bond market as an instrument of discipline against her own party and the voters. It’s the reason the chancellor can’t resign, no matter what promises she breaks. It’s the reason Labour MPs will have to knuckle down and vote to take billions off social security, as Starmer promised yesterday. What’s missing from this is any sense of statecraft, of mobilising the Treasury and the Bank to reach a new accommodation with markets. Also absent is any intuitive knowledge of voters, who were promised change. However hard the kicking given to Rishi Sunak last summer, one facet of the budget – from income-tax thresholds to the overall tax burden to our dependence on the kindness of strangers to finance our borrowing – is how far the UK remains stuck on the same sinking trajectory he set out in the wake of Brexit and Covid. Britain clings on to an exhausted 40-year-old economic model, to which it makes odd small adjustments in the hope they will change things. But they don’t. Performing a Thatcherite raindance (à la Truss) didn’t alter course; acting like grown-ups and repeating the phrase “world-leading” hasn’t helped. When working-class Americans turned out to vote last year, many said they were protesting against “the uniparty”: . However unfair the term, one understood its significance: the calcified consensus that meant Democrats and moderate Republicans couldn’t respond to their needs. Just over a year into the first Labour government since 2010, the British are being shown their own uniparty: a Westminster class too removed from voters to represent them, focused instead on court politics and presenting data centres for AI as golden investment. In the US, the uniparty got beaten by Donald Trump. What replaces the British version? Just take a guess.

commentisfree_2025_dec_02_patients-expect-surgeons-to-be-easy-to-talk-to.txt,opinion,2025-12-02,Ranjana Srivastava,It’s entirely reasonable to be in awe of surgeons – but patients need someone they can talk to,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/02/patients-expect-surgeons-to-be-easy-to-talk-to,"Some time ago, a judicious and considered surgeon was describing the complex operation required by our mutual cancer patient. The operation necessitated a large incision, prolonged anaesthesia and possibly a second operation. Then there were the long-term complications, including pain and disfigurement. The patient was elderly and somewhat vulnerable to begin with, so just listening to the plan filled me with consternation. So, without telling him how to do his job, I asked politely: “What does the patient want?” He looked at me as if I was disturbed before saying: “She wants to live. Isn’t that what everyone wants?” His question needed no reply because I knew that he knew that, in keeping with the evidence, many of our shared elderly patients emphatically chose quality of life over longevity. But I had reason to wonder if the patient had told the surgeon the same things she had told me over a consultation that had taken the best part of an hour. We had delved into her values, what mattered to her, and how she wanted to live the rest of her life. Living longer with the distinct possibility of a loss of independence had not been on her wishlist. This made me reflect on the information asymmetry between what patients told their oncologist or GP, and what they told their surgeon, which leads to substantially different treatment plans, neither “wrong” but each consequential in its own way. It has been traditionally assumed that patients expect the “listening” part of their care to be undertaken by physicians and leave the “doing” part to surgeons. As if to underline the disheartening public belief that a surgeon’s technical prowess must come at the cost of good bedside manner, a cardiologist friend recently recalled in the New England Journal of Medicine that when she told a patient he needed a heart valve replacement, he said: “I want the biggest asshole ever.” Really? Why? I wasn’t around to see how the average surgeon behaved 50 years ago but was lucky to be taught by one or two who were models of excellence in and out of the operating theatre. The narrow view of surgeons as technically adept and otherwise lacking seems anachronistic and ill-deserved, not to mention unhelpful for patients who should expect holistic care from all their providers. So what do patients really want from their surgeon? A recent study provides some answers. Patients value surgeons who provide emotional support and optimism, balancing facts with empathy and recognition of the emotional burden of illness. They want their surgeon to discuss the long-term impact of treatment, especially quality of life. They appreciate being shown commonly available tools such as decision aids, graphics and plain language information. Some patients want to defer decisions to their surgeon but many seek shared decision-making, which involves the fine art of melding professional knowledge with respect for the patient. Patients are increasingly aware that optimal decisions about cancer care require multidisciplinary input. A collection of surgeons and oncologists will focus on the disease but add in nursing, allied health, social work, dietitian, interpreter and palliative care and, suddenly, the whole person comes into view. Finally, some interesting findings about prognosis. Most patients want to know “the numbers”. How long do they have and is it more or less than other patients? Given the vagaries of the (incredibly intelligent) human body, this is a tough ask for any doctor. What makes it harder is that patients want to know the good news but not necessarily the bad. For instance, the high cure rate after surgery of many early detected cancers is good news for a surgeon to give. But advanced cancers have a guarded prognosis that partly depends on their molecular fingerprint. This discussion requires an oncologist’s nuanced knowledge about the plethora of drugs, their distinct side effects and the trade-off between risk and benefit. Unless one has prescribing experience, it is hard to convey what treatment might feel like. Now, one can appreciate how a well-intentioned conversation about prognosis can quickly descend into unfamiliar territory for the surgeon. I wonder if successful surgery is easier to visualise than a successful conversation. Patients often mention the long and involved nature of their surgery and feel happy that the surgeon “got it all”. But difficult conversations never seem to get it all – there is always something left untapped, unsaid, unfulfilled, that one might discover the next week or the next year. One of the hardest things I find about being an oncologist is when patients express delayed disappointment with how they were spoken to when they were at their most vulnerable: it is an opportunity lost. It is said that from those who are given a lot, a lot is expected. It is entirely reasonable to be in awe of surgeons for their extraordinary commitment to training (commonly 15 to 20 years post high school), physical stamina and mental agility – but then we also want them to be like the person next door, easy to talk to. Studies like this tell us what patients want. They also reaffirm the need to raise expectations and train future surgeons in communication skills to deliver. After our chat, my surgeon colleague went back to the patient and asked what she wanted. She decided that the proposed multi-hour, multi-team feat was not in her best interest and was content with doing less (but not with doing nothing). Having taken the time to understand her goals, he cancelled her surgery. The 87-year-old patient subsequently asked me if the surgeon (half her age) was “hurt” by her stance. No, I said. We were there to serve her needs, not the other way around. Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

What a cheering thought",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/02/rachel-reeves-keir-starmer-budget,"Good times for Britain when the chancellor is saved by the Office for Budget Responsibility being slightly more inept than her at a single convenient moment. Following the accidental early publication of the fiscal watchdog’s market-sensitive budget document, chair Richard Hughes has now fallen on his sword. Although it’s possible he meant to fall on his feet but just mistimed it. On Monday we discovered that the OBR’s website is not securely hosted but was built using WordPress. Oh man. That’s definitely budget, but is it responsible? It may as well just have had a Tumblr. This series of unfortunate events meant the OBR bigwigs were a man down when they appeared before the Treasury select committee this morning, butching out the decision to go to war with Rachel Reeves by releasing their draft economic assessments in the weeks leading up to the budget. Did the chancellor seriously mislead the country about the state of the public finances? That is the £4.2bn question. Are our problems going to turn out to be a whole lot bigger than something that could be addressed with £4.2bn? The answer to that is regrettably too obvious to state. Even so, we must return to the chancellor’s endlessly self-referenced black hole, which seems in fact to have been a multibillion-pound surplus. Astrophysically speaking, there may be precedents for what Reeves did. Back in 2019, some astronomers breathlessly reported the discovery of a Milky Way black hole so massive that it actually contradicted known stellar-evolution theory. Unfortunately, follow-up research revealed the black hole didn’t actually exist at all, and was just an illusory light effect. Quite embarrassing at Big Astronomy’s annual Christmas drinks, no doubt, but obviously much less cosmically excruciating than Reeves’s weirdo press conference nearly four weeks ago, in which she kept warning she was facing “the world as it is”. It’s possible the chancellor needs to employ a science consultant in the vein of those ones who advise Marvel movies, and make assessments like “if there was a substance you couldn’t touch, it’s my considered and lucrative opinion that Agent Carter could move it using magnetic fields”. Or: “Yeah, a wormhole called the Devil’s Anus could definitely transport Thor and Hulk back to Asgard.” Or: “A black hole of £20bn could simultaneously be a surplus of £4.2bn, and also in no way mark the event horizon of your frontbench career.” And with that, let us take a highly scientific quantum leap to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is also, unsurprisingly, attempting to butch things out. Most recent Labour leaders have had a fundamental/fundamentalist belief in their own moral rectitude. It is one of the rare shared traits to unite Tony Blair and Jeremy Corbyn, two men who always see the very best in themselves. And there is increasingly no denying that the current PM has grown swiftly into this tradition. “I am proud to have scrapped the two-child limit,” Keir intoned yesterday, in a speech designed to shore up the budget, “proud to have lifted half a million children out of poverty.” Fascinating to hear that Starmer is extremely proud of doing something that he last year suspended seven of his MPs for voting for. As indicated, the rolling budget fiasco had coaxed Starmer out of his bunker and into a London community centre on Monday morning, where he offered a bullish defence of the budget to remind the world that if they wanted to bring down his chancellor, they would have to go through him first. An ultimatum to which the prevalent answer among the general public would be: fine, let’s do this. We’re literally free right now. But politicians are more sophisticated and special, aren’t they? Thus Labour malcontents keep briefing that they are waiting for what are widely expected to be disastrous local election results in May before moving against Starmer. This feels like me briefing that I am waiting for the toddler to drop the vase before I remove the vase from the toddler. It’s apparently called being strategic: look it up. So in the absence of anyone having anything in the same galaxy as a plan, we keep being advised to simply accept that Starmer and Reeves come as a package. Yet in truth, they are an odd pairing. Reeves presents herself as the hapless victim of circumstance who has little free will in any matters at all. “Any chancellor of any party would be standing here today, facing the choices I face … ” Starmer, on the other hand, presents himself as a man of action who can nonetheless deliver a two-and-a-half-thousand-word speech featuring only a handful of verbs. For a man who chides populist opposition politicians for offering “easy answers”, the prime minister doesn’t half rely on some himself. It seems to be different when he does it, though. Not to play the hotshot economist, but anyone can reduce energy bills if they raise the sums people are required to pay in tax. And I’m not saying anyone could trumpet “our free childcare expansion”, but the Tories could, since the policy of expanding free childcare to 30 hours by this September was, in fact, a pledge made in 2023 by the previous chancellor, Jeremy Hunt. Or, as Starmer put it yesterday: “We will keep going, we will continue to reject drift, to confront reality … ” Will we? Or will we just continue bobbing along on this five-year absence of mission, led – not remotely boldly – by the captain of the Starship Lack-of-Enterprise? Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"

I think my original plan was that some of the draws could contain something other than chocolate, not because I’m the kind of almond mum who won’t let anyone eat sweets before breakfast, but because their dad and I are separated and have them half the time each, so it wasn’t unusual for them to wake up and have six Lindt chocolate balls to chomp through before they’d opened their curtains. The tiny drawers are a curse. Some years I could only find stuff for one of the kids (erasers in the shape of hedgehogs; lip balm); other years, a different one was in luck (Lego Yodas; magnets). It was never, ever fair. One year, I found tons of different batteries for the drawers, and I thought it was the most genius thing I’d ever done, but they said: “How is this a fun gift? If we needed a battery, we’d just go to the kitchen drawer, which is supposed to have batteries in it.” I realised in about 2019 that I’d just have to start planning earlier, around July, if I wanted to strike the perfect balance of parity, festivity and usefulness, and that was a good year, actually. I found some tiny business cards with swear words on them that they could just leave around the house, and ear-splitting whistles and unisex lip balm. We have enough erasers and pencil sharpeners now to last until nobody ever makes a mistake because the written word is just a memory. Then, wham, this year it happened: I forgot. One minute it was November and all about the fireworks. Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would be December next. Whatever goes in those drawers now, it’ll have to be so good, and so surprising, and so unprecedented to make up for this. I’m going to need 72 reptile eggs. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"

David Lammy, the justice secretary, thinks so. Under his proposals, jury trials in England and Wales will be effectively halved. Currently, defendants charged with “either-way” offences have the right to choose whether to be tried by magistrates or a jury. But Mr Lammy wants any case where the likely sentence is less than three years – everything from sexual offences to theft to violence to narco-crime – to be judge-only. This is the most sweeping change to criminal justice in modern British history. Only the gravest crimes – such as murder and rape – will retain lay participation. Mr Lammy once said juries filter prejudice. He should rethink plans to strip away ancient rights without evidence they will speed up justice. Jury trials account for less than 3% of all criminal cases. They are not what clogs the system. Sir Brian Leveson, whose review Mr Lammy cites as inspiration, did not recommend a blanket scrapping of defendants’ right to opt for a jury. He did not suggest using speculative sentence predictions to determine the mode of trial. He did not propose removing lay participation from “either-way” trials. He did not call for expanding magistrates’ sentencing powers to two years, nor for judge-only trials across whole categories of crime. Instead, Sir Brian proposed that for most “either-way” offences a judge would sit with two magistrates – a change that would retain the lay element for fairness but speed up trials. That protection is what Mr Lammy wants gone. As the former lord chief justice Lord Thomas told the BBC, removing lay input is “the most controversial and serious aspect of the reforms proposed”. It strips away ordinary citizens’ involvement in deciding guilt – a right that has survived monarchs and wars, but apparently not Mr Lammy’s inability to stand up to the Treasury. The justice secretary said that the system was at breaking point with a backlog of 78,000 crown court cases, some listed into the next decade. This is not the fault of juries, but was caused by a decade of cuts. Mr Lammy thinks that magistrates can take up the slack – and there’s something in that – but they already face 361,000 pending cases. The delays in justice are down to courts being closed while staff and judges have not been replaced. Digital forensics collapsed under the weight of modern evidence. Legal aid was gutted, driving barristers from the profession. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was starved of resources. A serious plan to rebuild justice would reopen courts and recruit judges. Legal aid needs to be rebuilt, as does the CPS. There needs to be investment to repair what austerity destroyed. But Mr Lammy’s plans are for fewer juries, more magistrates and longer sentences. Prisons are already bursting at the seams and real-terms day-to-day spending by the Ministry of Justice this year is 14% lower than in 2008. The rightwing playbook is to first defund the public realm. Once it collapses, politicians declare it inefficient and replace safeguards with “managerial efficiency”. The goal is to shrink the state’s obligations permanently. Removing jury trials for offences under three years opens the door to raising that limit to five. A party founded to expand democratic participation may destroy one of its oldest privileges. In surrendering to such dismal logic, Mr Lammy risks not only weakening the justice system but forfeiting Labour’s own moral inheritance. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The reaction was compounded when it emerged that Wayne Couzens, who is serving a whole-life term in prison, had previously committed sexual offences that the police had ignored. In her latest report on these events, Lady Angiolini frames sexually motivated crimes against women in public places as a “whole-society problem”. She exposes a shocking lack of action on earlier recommendations and reveals that basic facts, such as how many women each year are sexually assaulted or raped in public in England or Wales, are not in any single dataset. The report recommends a national rollout of Project Vigilant, which protects women in the night-time economy, and Operation Soteria, which raises standards in rape and sexual assault investigations. Alongside a “clear-sighted and unrelenting” focus on predators, it rightly highlights early intervention and prevention, including education work with boys. Other recommendations include a clearer focus on women’s safety in planning rules and a call for ministers to respond more fully to the independent review on pornography. Detailed recommendations on police recruitment, culture and policy will come later, as will findings about David Carrick, the former police officer convicted of 50 rapes. But police chiefs and the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, must set out their responses to what has been uncovered so far. While Couzens and Carrick are in prison, we already know of grave shortcomings in the way that complaints against both men were handled by colleagues. While individuals must be held accountable whenever possible, systems and policies also need to change. The deadly consequences of policing’s culture of impunity are also made clear in a new report on the Hillsborough disaster. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found that 12 officers would have faced disciplinary cases of gross misconduct if they had not retired or died. Those named include Peter Wright, who was chief constable of South Yorkshire police in 1989 and responsible for fans’ safety, and officers who worked for the West Midlands force that failed to investigate properly the police’s role in the deaths of 97 people and the cover-up that followed. While the 14 years taken by the IOPC to produce its report is hard to understand, by far the most damaging delay was in the two decades after the disaster. In the end it took the non-legal process known as the Hillsborough Independent Panel to get to the truth about police lies. The latest findings provide further backing for the new duty of candour being placed on public servants. Had this been in place at the time, police officers could have been penalised for not being open and honest. But while this vindication of their efforts has been welcomed by campaigners, it does not dispel their fury that not a single one of the officers involved has been convicted of a criminal offence, or faced disciplinary proceedings when they were serving. What these two reports, issued on the same day, make brutally obvious is that the culture as well as laws governing policing must be overhauled. Accountability must become a guiding principle. It should not be up to traumatised families to ensure that deaths like those of the Hillsborough victims and Sarah Everard can never happen again.

commentisfree_2025_dec_02_white-house-media-bias-tracker-gimmick.txt,opinion,2025-12-02,Margaret Sullivan,The White House’s new media ‘bias’ tracker is a desperate gimmick,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/02/white-house-media-bias-tracker-gimmick,"Donald Trump has used the mainstream press as a punching bag for many years, but in recent weeks his jabs have become even more frequent – and more ill-tempered. He threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn last month over the editing of a documentary that aired more than a year ago. He called one White House reporter “piggy”, and told another – the well-regarded Mary Bruce of ABC News – that she was a “terrible person and a terrible reporter”. He called a New York Times reporter “ugly, both inside and out”. And last Friday, his White House unveiled the latest wrinkle: a new website that supposedly tracks media bias. It offers a “Hall of Shame” and “media offenders of the week” to focus on reporting that the president dislikes. It names individuals and news organizations, and it points to the Boston Globe and CBS News, among others, for doing supposedly misleading and biased work. It uses terms like “left wing lunacy” to describe some of its complaints. The site’s first iteration is particularly focused on media reporting about Trump’s call for six Democratic members of Congress to be arrested, tried and punished for their supposedly “seditious” video reminding military and intelligence personnel that they are not obliged to follow illegal orders. Trump even boosted a social media post that shouted: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD” (He later told Fox News he wasn’t “threatening death, but I think they’re in serious trouble”). All this for a video in which the members of Congress sought to remind people that military members make an oath to the constitution, not to the president. “Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,” Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a former astronaut and a US navy veteran, says on the video. Trump has been especially furious about Kelly, who seems like just the wrong person to go after, giving his background of service and high credibility. The White House site crows that those journalists and outlets who reported on all this are now “exposed”. There really is something being exposed here, but it’s not the reporting. It’s Trump’s own increasing desperation and his decreasing ability to countenance anything other than flattery and sycophancy. That’s not what the mainstream press is – or should be – in the business of providing. But as Jonathan Lemire reported this week in the Atlantic, this president has become more and more isolated lately. His social media appears mostly restricted to his own (poorly named) Truth Social site; his travel is generally not to meet with (or even see) ordinary Americans; instead he tends to hang out with the billionaires who want something from his administration and are willing to cozy up shamelessly to get it. “President Trump has never before been in such an echo chamber,” according to Lemire. “His domestic travel has basically stopped. He sees rich donors and Maga media, not actual voters.” Given that bubble, harsh reality via the media is a rude intrusion, and the new White House site is an evident effort to dispel the discomfort by disparaging it. Who, I wonder, does Trump think he’s reaching with this effort? The Maga faithful, of course, don’t need to be persuaded. They already are fully on board with anything their dear leader does. And most other Americans – even some of the millions who voted for him – already have his number. Trump’s overall approval rating of 38% is the lowest since his return to the presidency, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. It has fallen dramatically since the start of that second term and is down two percentage points just since the beginning of November. Even his iron grip on the Republican party has weakened. All of that is a deep worry with the approach of the midterm elections – less than a year away. Who can he blame? Why, the press, of course. And that’s precisely what this new site is all about. Will it work? Granted, trust in the mainstream press is low, so reporters and news organizations are a convenient target of criticism. And granted, media bias exists, though the most blatant is on the far right, the busy pro-Trump propagandists. But I agree with Seth Stern, director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation, who told the Washington Post that most people – whatever their politics – aren’t going to buy what this new “bias tracker” is selling. “People understand the obvious conflict inherent in a presidential administration appointing itself the arbiter of media bias,” Stern said. That’s especially true for media criticism from those doing the bidding of Trump, who has made his antipathy toward the press so central to his persona. Calling out inaccurate and biased reporting is a fair pursuit. Journalists are far from flawless; they make mistakes, and the best of them correct those quickly and fully. But that’s not what this new site is about. And trashing the media is not going to help Trump get out of the trouble – or the bubble – that he’s in.

commentisfree_2025_dec_03_can-you-be-on-six-figure-income-still-be-considered-poor.txt,opinion,2025-12-03,Arwa Mahdawi,Can you be on a six-figure income and still be considered poor?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/03/can-you-be-on-six-figure-income-still-be-considered-poor,"Have you heard that a family of four in the US is now considered poor if their household income is under $136,500 (£103,300) a year? Don’t @ me about the maths – I’m just the messenger. The person behind this calculation is Michael Green, who is chief strategist and portfolio manager for Simplify Asset Management. I think this means that he makes large sums of money by fiddling with even larger sums of money. When not doing that, Green writes a newsletter and recently published a viral piece on Substack arguing that the poverty line, calculated as $31,200 by the Department of Health and Human Services, is a “broken benchmark”. These days a family with a low six-figure income is officially “the new poor”, he reasoned. Green’s essay has sparked numerous rebuttals, with people arguing that he had turned the poverty measure into a middle-class measure. “It’s completely disconnected from reality,” the economist Kevin Corinth said, for example, noting that the $136,500 figure was higher than the US median household income of $83,730. “It’s laughable to put a poverty line far above the median income in the United States.” Is it really that laughable? I don’t think there’s anything particularly funny about the fact that it’s hard for a family to live on the median income now. While you can certainly quibble with Green’s figures and methodology, the larger point he makes is valuable, and something more people in his tax bracket need to understand. One of the most frustrating things about the 2024 election was the way in which Joe Biden (and then Kamala Harris) kept insisting how great the US economy was. That messaging was enraging because, for most people, the economy doesn’t mean markers such as labour market resilience. It means: “Can I afford my housing, my transport and my dinner?” It means: “Can I really afford to have a kid when childcare costs the same as college and health insurance keeps going up?” The answer to all those things is, increasingly: “Hell, no.” The fact that life is now ridiculously expensive is hardly a revelation, but I’m glad that a Wall Street bro is finally cottoning on. Green has figured out why there’s such immense anger in the US. It’s not about immigrants; it’s the inequitable economy, stupid. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

commentisfree_2025_dec_03_fear-future-british-politics-stuck-past.txt,opinion,2025-12-03,Rafael Behr,Fear of facing the future has British politics stuck in the past,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/03/fear-future-british-politics-stuck-past,"Hollywood has stopped betting on original ideas. Sequels and remakes dominate the box office. Among this year’s Christmas movie releases are Zootropolis 2 (the first Zootropolis came out in 2016), Avatar: Fire and Ash (third in a series that began in 2009), and Wicked: For Good (part two of the adaptation of a musical that premiered in 2003). New stories are risky. It is safer to retell old ones. British politics feels similarly afflicted by paralysis of the imagination, intimidated by change, stuck in a narrative loop. After much pre-publicity, last week finally saw the release of the Rachel Reeves fiscal blockbuster, Budget II: the Quest for More Headroom. The plot was not very different from 2024’s Budget I: Filling a Black Hole. Both times the chancellor was under pressure to consolidate public finances without starving state services or breaking an election pledge not to use the Treasury’s biggest revenue-raising levers. Both times she hiked other taxes, clinging to the letter of the manifesto while shredding it in spirit. Reviews for the sequel were bad, but Labour MPs are happy that action has been taken to alleviate child poverty. Bond markets stayed calm, which the Treasury chalks up as a win. The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, denounced Reeves for presenting “a budget for Benefits Street, paid for by working people”. No marks for originality there. Benefits Street was a documentary that aired in 2014. The charge that social spending siphons cash from dutiful taxpayers to scrounging layabouts has been in the Tory repertoire for generations. As Badenoch’s leadership has faltered, she has become ever more reliant on her party’s rhetorical back catalogue. In the early months, she toyed with novel arguments, trying to make Conservatism relevant to the 2020s. There was an elaborate critique of modern liberalism having been “hacked” by authoritarian leftists. There was a theory of economic decline caused by woke civil servants and a glut of human resources managers. Those weird diagnoses, mostly convoluted restatements of small-state Conservative orthodoxy, didn’t catch on. Badenoch came under growing pressure to say something that her shrinking base could cheer (or even understand). So she kept it simple and ran repeats of classic Tory favourites: cut taxes, welfare and immigration; build a bonfire of red tape; down with Europeans and their meddlesome human rights; all hail Mrs Thatcher, the last truly Conservative prime minister. In the marketplace of lazy political sequels, Badenoch can’t compete with Nigel Farage. The Reform UK leader is always on screen, plugging the umpteenth iteration of his anti-foreigner franchise. The script for his next general election campaign is already written. Brexit II: Take Maximum Control. The opposition would find it harder to repackage and sell the past in this way if Labour had a governing agenda that described the future in compelling terms. But Keir Starmer came to office light on policy, with a campaign strategy cribbed from a 1997 Tony Blair playbook which itself had been drafted in reaction to Labour’s traumatic defeat in 1992. For want of the courage to win a difficult argument over taxes, Starmer and his shadow chancellor bound themselves with pledges best suited to help Neil Kinnock beat John Major in a hypothetical rerun of an election 32 years previously. In opposition, Reeves had attempted some renewal of centre-left economic doctrine. She called it “securonomics”. The argument was that markets could no longer be relied on to drive prosperity. That era was over. In the new volatile times, the state could facilitate wealth creation by underwriting economic security at national and individual level – promoting social protection, restoring labour rights and funding infrastructure investment. If you hold Reeves’s budgets up to the light at a favourable angle, you can still see the outline of that idea. If the money now being spent does somehow generate collective wellbeing in excess of all current forecasts, the chancellor will be vindicated. But per-capita disposable incomes are set to rise by just 0.5% per year over the rest of the parliament. There is no secret growth-stimulating sauce. Without one, “securonomics” is reduced to an exercise in buying time with concessions to restive Labour MPs and hoping to avoid economic accidents. The Starmer-Reeves project is a big bet on national renewal derived from business investment that will be attracted to Britain by political and economic stability. Two flaws stand out. First, the government doesn’t look stable. Second, domestic conditions are vulnerable to external shocks in a turbulent world. With Donald Trump in the White House, some kind of crisis looks probable. Starmer spends enough time jetting around the globe in response to international volatility to be aware of the problem. In a foreign policy speech on Monday at the Lady Mayor’s Banquet in London, the prime minister offered a rare window on to his geopolitical perspective. He identified the US, the EU and China as “three global giants … all interacting with each other” and predicted that Britain’s future “will be determined by how we navigate this dynamic”. He set out his navigational principles. Britain should build alliances and do unilateral deals. The national interest is best secured through engagement with “like-minded nations” on the basis of “democracy, freedom, the rule of law”, but that shouldn’t prevent deeper business links with China. Apparently there is no contradiction there. Some kind of firewall will prevent commercial entanglement compromising national security. Starmer dismisses any notion of a strategic choice between Europe and the US. He doesn’t expect that Washington and Brussels will make incompatible claims on Britain’s allegiance in matters of trade or security. (They surely will.) It is unclear how this policy of equidistance sits with the Trump administration’s indulgence of Kremlin positions on Ukraine. Maybe the US constitution will withstand assault by Maga authoritarianism and a reliable transatlantic partnership can be restored. Maybe the model of rules-based, globalised free trade that suited Britain’s economy isn’t lost for ever. Just maybe. But also maybe the fall of American democracy is a looming geopolitical shock equivalent in scale to the collapse of the USSR. It would be reassuring to think the prime minister is measuring that risk. It feels likelier he is just hoping bad things won’t happen. In that respect, Starmer’s foreign policy and Reeves’s budgets do form a doctrine of sorts. They are as one in claiming to deal with the world as it is, while their actions plead in vain for restoration of the world as it once was. Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_dec_03_letters-text-messages-passwords-why-cant-nhs-just-give-me-someone-to-talk-to.txt,opinion,2025-12-03,Adrian Chiles,Letters. Text messages. Passwords and more passwords. Why can’t the NHS just give me someone to talk to?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/03/letters-text-messages-passwords-why-cant-nhs-just-give-me-someone-to-talk-to,"I had this thing on the back of my shoulder, which a dermatologist at an NHS hospital looked at. He was brisk, verging on brusque. He said it was either one complicated-sounding thing or the other, but I distinctly heard the word “carcinoma” in there somewhere. He said I’d have to come back and have it taken out, and then they would see whether or not it was a carcinoma. Great. When? We’ll write to you, he said. I suggested that, if cancer was a possibility, then a bit of hurry-up might be called for. To which he said: “Oh, it won’t make any difference now. The only thing that would have made any difference was if you’d come sooner.” To me, this sentence argued against itself somewhat. Time was either of the essence, or it wasn’t. I even flirted with the idea of interpreting “won’t make any difference now” as his way of saying I was doomed anyway. I called the dermatologist I had previously seen about it privately, and she told me not to be silly, it would be fine. A GP I know said the same. I thanked my lucky stars that I’m privileged to have access to such people. Two weeks later, I was back in for the excision, performed by the same guy I’d seen before. This time, he said he was pretty sure it was cancer, cancerous, a carcinoma, whatever. What is the right bloody word to use anyway? This obviously raised the question, if it is cancer, then what do we do? “Then,” he said, “we have to have a conversation.” Honestly, I don’t think there’s a way of hearing this without it sounding ominous. But by now I was almost past caring. All I wanted him to do was stop saying worrying things and, instead, whip out his scalpel, go in as deep as he fancied, and dig the bastard thing out. This he did. He told me to get the stitches taken out in 10 days’ time, and he would either call or write with the results of the tests. On the way home, something dawned on me: if there were now to be a problem with the wound or, like in some horror film, the excised growth reanimated and came bursting up through the stitches, I had no means of contacting this dermatologist. I doubt I would ever have had cause to talk to him, but I would have liked to have known the option was there. So what would I have done? Gone back to my GP, I suppose, taking up their valuable time. A week later, a letter arrived from the hospital. With trembling hands, I opened it. Imagine my exasperation on finding this was not notice of my results, but notification of the original appointment for the excision. Terrific. And still no one to speak to. This, more than anything, is what matters to me. I don’t care about the shabbiness of hospitals, confusion over appointment times and places, even the poor communication skills of some doctors. I just want to know there’s a number to call, which will get me someone relevant to talk to. But there isn’t. I know this, because when I had no choice but to call, there was no one remotely helpful on the other end of the line. Twenty-three days after the excision, my phone pinged with a message saying there was stuff to read on my NHS app. This was last Thursday. There were two letters on there – one inviting me to an appointment to see a new dermatologist at a different hospital on Monday, the other to an appointment in March with yet another dermatologist at the original hospital. No test results then. Obviously too grim to relate by letter. The first appointment was presumably to give me the bad news – that I was done for – and the second would be just to check I was dead. I got a grip. I called the number on the letter. Apart from anything else, I’d be 200 miles away on Monday so needed the appointment to be over the phone. The number, of course, went to some central admin call centre. “I will escalate the request,” the woman said. I emailed. Nothing back. Then, ping! Oh, this will be it. Nope. Just a text confirming the appointment. Then, another ping! This one, surely? No. This was yet another confirmation, generated for the NHS by a company called DrDoctor – “award-winning technology and expertise to transition the NHS to a hybrid model of healthcare”. There were emails too. And also, so help me God, an automated phone call seeking my feedback on the quality of service. By now I wanted to flush my phone down the toilet. This crap masquerades as communication, but communication is either two-way or it’s nothing. So this was nothing. Plenty of DrDoctor, but no actual doctor. Drowning now in an alphanumeric soup of different passwords and usernames, I dug deep into the apps. One of them, ostensibly from the trust but “powered by Patients Know Best” – told me the test results weren’t due until 18 December. The founder of Patients Know Best, I read, was motivated by his frustration at “witnessing patients experience suboptimal care as a result of disjointed information sharing”. I decided not to drive the 200 miles to the hospital for the Monday morning appointment. This was just as well, because if I had done so I would have been sitting in the waiting room when my phone rang with the telephone appointment I’d requested. I was too beside myself with gratitude to moan much about not being informed that this would be happening. “Admin’s a totally different department,” the nurse on the phone said, apologetic but helpless. She was kind, she was knowledgable, she was all I’d wanted. It took just five minutes. Oh yes, I almost forgot, it was a squamous cell carcinoma. All removed and won’t spread. So not nothing, but not serious. Needs keeping an eye on. Whatever, I don’t care, because I now have this skin cancer nurse’s email. The human contact feels as good as any treatment or cure. • Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_dec_03_maga-coalition-cracks-republicans-trump.txt,opinion,2025-12-03,Moira Donegan,Cracks have emerged in the Maga coalition,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/03/maga-coalition-cracks-republicans-trump,"The sharks can smell blood in the water. After a decade in eerie command of the Republican party, with primary voters in his cult-like thrall and down-ballot elected officials feeling they have no choice – and often no inclination – to diverge from him, Donald Trump suddenly seems not quite in control of his own political machine. Fractures have emerged in the Maga coalition; Trump’s approval is sinking; the Democrats, long anemic and risk-averse in the opposition, showed signs of life in elections last month; and the cumulative effect of a series of long-running scandals, most particularly the Epstein affair, seem to have alienated core components of the Trump faithful. Trump has faced some rebukes from a once largely compliant federal judiciary: his personal attorney, Alina Habba, was recently declared ineligible to serve in the US attorney role Trump had appointed her to, and his signature tariffs seem likely to be struck down by a conservative supreme court majority. Trump himself, meanwhile, is unfocused, losing his signature humor and charisma, and showing his age. In recent photos he looks pale, exhausted; he seems to have struggled to keep his eyes open in front of cameras. Trump seems more interested in the construction of his oversized ballroom than in the work of policy. His advisers – the scheming group of frauds, racists, opportunists and swindlers who surround him in his second term – are evidently running the show, and they do not always see eye to eye. The old man won’t be around forever; Republicans are beginning to imagine what the country – and more importantly, their own careers – will look like without him. Is this how the Trump era in American politics ends – not with a bang, but with a whimper? It would be overstating the case, and speaking far too soon, to say that Trump has become a lame duck, or that the Republican party is moving on from the identity that he gave it. But the signals of his waning influence are everywhere. For one thing, more and more Republicans seem willing to break with Trump – something that would have been unthinkable for them, and a kind of career suicide, just a few months ago. While Trump was able to compel Republicans in the Texas state legislature to draw new congressional district maps with just a command (an effort that is now facing an uphill battle in the courts), Republicans in Indiana are resisting Trump’s push to have them do the same, with one GOP legislator saying that she “will not cave” on redistricting even as she announced a pipe bomb threat had been called into her house. Other signs are beginning to stir. Trump, with his typically casual relationship to the truth, has insisted that the economy is booming as a result of his ill-conceived tariff program. “Costs are way down,” he said, falsely, in a long 10 November interview with Fox’s Laura Ingraham. But Ingraham pushed back – rare for a Fox host – and soon, other rightwing mouthpieces were, too; weary of repeating the Biden administration’s 2024 mistake of projecting a sunnier picture of the economy than that reflected by consumer sentiment, and perhaps chastened by the sweeping victories of 2025 Democratic candidates who ran on messages of affordability. Soon, both JD Vance and Ben Shapiro were telling a different story on the economy. “When President Trump says things are becoming more affordable, people don’t believe that,” Shapiro said. Vance asked voters for “patience”: “We get it and we hear you, and we know that there’s a lot of work to do.” It’s a low bar, to be able to merely contradict or disagree with the president. Nevertheless, it is noticeable that more and more Republicans are clearing it; many of them have spent the better part of their careers, at this point, praising the emperor’s new clothes. A few are going further. Among the most damaging scandals of the Trump era is the slow drip of revelations about the depth of friendship between Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the dead financier and pedophile, and the accumulation of documents both from Trump to Epstein and by Epstein about Trump that suggest that Trump, in Epstein’s parlance, “knew about the girls”. The Epstein saga, after all, had been a major fixture of the paranoid conspiracies in the far-right media ecosystem, whose podcasts, Discords, and YouTube channels helped drive Trump to victory in 2024. Those conspiracy-minded communities once viewed Trump as a quasi-messianic figure – as in QAnon, the pandemic-era viral sensation that posited Trump as the leader of a vast, secret effort to undermine a cabal of powerful pedophiles. But these same groups have begun to turn on Trump as the newly revealed documents from the Epstein estate – and the Trump administration’s efforts to repress them – have made this fantasy harder to maintain. The politicians who swept into office on the strength of the QAnon theory are taking note. Majorie Taylor Greene, an ambitious Georgia congresswoman and onetime conspiracy theorist, broke with Trump publicly over the Epstein issue; soon after he declared her an enemy, she announced that she would be leaving Congress in January. She won’t be the last. As Republicans continue to face strong headwinds from anti-Trump sentiment going into 2026, and as Trump himself dwindles in popularity, accumulates liabilities, and proves unwilling to compromise on his demands or reward loyal Republicans, it is likely that more and more GOP representatives will be looking for the exits. Meanwhile, Maga has begun to eat its own, with infighting over Epstein, antisemitism and economics slowly beginning to turn Trump’s operatives against each other as they jockey for position. The Trump era is not over – far from it – but we may be seeing the beginning of its next phase: what is likely to be a bleak, bloody and belligerent battle of succession.

While real difference exists between liberals and social conservatives, or between globalisers and nationalists, the right has a stronger sense of self-interest. It is much less likely to allow perfect to be the enemy of good. It is by understanding this that you can see past Nigel Farage’s denial of comments that he expects Reform to do an election deal with the Conservatives, as reported by the Financial Times. Particularly since this denial is caveated by his statement that he won’t work with the Tories “as they are”. Likewise, reports in the Times that senior Reform figures are appealing to Farage to secure the defection of Robert Jenrick and appoint him as chancellor after an election victory may be rejected by Jenrick. But whatever their individual ambitions, both will surely concede to the emerging consensus: to unite the right, at whatever cost. It is easy for Farage to deny these claims for now, riding high as Reform has been since the general election. But despite doubling its support, it has seemingly hit a ceiling in the low 30s in the polls. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have stabilised in the mid-teens. With no knockout blow looking likely from either side, there is immense pressure from party funders and the rightwing press, the Daily Mail in particular, which wrote a strident leader column in September calling on “all the talents on the Right to come together to sweep away this lamentable excuse for a government”. It is not hard to see why. Analysis conducted by my organisation Compass shows that at the last general election the combined vote of Reform and the Tories should have won them 202 extra seats but they cancelled each other out. Avoiding this in 2029 could take many forms, from an outright merger, an alliance or simply what Labour and the Liberal Democrats did before the last election, which is to agree in private which party went for which seat. This last arrangement has the benefit of being deniable and doesn’t require any detailed public negotiations. But progressives will probably not have the easier luxury of strategic integration. While the regressive bloc is divided in two, the progressive side splinters into four in England if Your Party gets itself election-ready, alongside Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, but not forgetting assorted independents. That number rises to five in Scotland and Wales with the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru. This potentially disastrous fragmentation of the party-political scene has been a long time coming. A world of two polarised upper and lower classes and two TV channels, BBC and ITV, has given way to far more nuanced identities and multiple options and platforms in almost every aspect of life. A two-party politics was never going to survive this huge culture shift. As in 2019 and 2024, a party can be handed a majority if there is a polarising issue of the day such as Brexit or the desire to be rid of the Tories. But the underlying fragmentation means that even with respective majorities of 80 then and 180 in 2024, governments have no electoral and civil society foundations for the long-term management of the country on a single-party basis. Labour’s 2024 victory was the lowest in terms of quantity of vote and arguably quality of support. It is little wonder chaos has ensued. Labour strategists know all this. But their answer isn’t to embrace the fragmentation and the pluralist politics such differences demand but double down on control and coercion. They will try to frame the next election as a clear choice between whoever is the Labour prime minister and Nigel Farage. In this it mirrors the strategy of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who keeps pushing to the centre right to build the non-far right majority in the belief that voters have nowhere else to go. But the harsh truth is that this strategy is doomed to fail. First because progressive voters are increasingly unprepared to hold their noses and vote for what they perceive as a non-progressive option, even if it’s the least bad. France saw the rise of the New Popular Front, while in the UK voters are backing the clearest progressive alternative to Reform, like they did in the recent Caerphilly byelection to the Senedd where Plaid Cymru won, and Labour went from first to a very distant third. But more importantly, this coercive strategy simply papers over the cracks of a politics in which the Overton window moves steadily towards the hard right and the likely big victory of the party that represents a full-fat rather than semi-skimmed version of national populism. Cold electoral logic suggests the right will unite in some shape or form. On the left the ball is in Labour’s court in two crucial respects. First it must become once again a clearly progressive choice for progressive voters. Waging war on asylum seekers and stripping back the jury system are the very opposite of what’s needed. Instead, what’s needed is a fundamentally different fully throated economic approach to re-making Britain in the interests of greater equality, such as wealth taxes. The second shift is to pluralism and the recognition that only by mobilising progressives can a mandate for meaningful transformative change be won. That “new system for a new society” starts with a commitment to proportional representation and the benefits of an alliance-based politics that, because it is agile, establishes a long-term consensus for change. It is high time the left doesn’t just preach unity and solidarity, but practises it. Neal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation Compass"

It was one of the most urgent questions asked in 2021 when a serving police officer, PC Wayne Couzens, was charged with the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard. In the first report of Elish Angiolini’s inquiry into this dreadful sequence of events, published in February last year, she made the eminently sensible recommendation that any individual with a caution or conviction for a sexual offence should be rejected during police vetting. It seemed the very least that should happen, yet we’ve learned from Lady Angiolini’s second report this week that the recommendation has yet to be implemented. She reveals that it took 18 months after publication for police chiefs to agree a blanket ban on recruits who have convictions, and even then it wasn’t included in draft Home Office regulations issued in September this year. The Home Office has now told Angiolini that a ban will be included, but it won’t be retrospective. The delay is all the more astonishing because her first report highlighted a series of “lamentable and repeated” missed opportunities to stop Couzens, who was a heavy user of violent pornography and had a history of exposing himself in public. Couzens should never have been a police officer and neither should David Carrick, who was sent to prison for life in 2023 for committing sexual offences against more than a dozen women while serving in the same force. Angiolini’s latest report offers an insight into the extent of the problem, revealing that checks against the police national database in 2023-24 led to 461 police officers, staff and volunteers being referred to “an appropriate authority”. Nine cases triggered further criminal investigations and 88 disciplinary investigations. As Angiolini reminds us, all sorts of promises were made after Everard’s murder. Yet here we are, more than four years later, reading another report that is basically a catalogue of repeated and preventable failures. A quarter of police forces in England and Wales have yet to implement “basic policies for investigating sexual offences”. Neither police nor government ministers know the scale of attacks on women in public spaces by strangers. Efforts to reduce violence against women are “fragmented, underfunded and overly reliant on short-term solutions”. A promise in 2023 to give violence against women and girls (VAWG) the same status in crime prevention as terrorism hasn’t been met. The truth is that it isn’t a priority at all. “Too often prevention in this space remains just words,” Angiolini says bluntly. Labour won an election almost 18 months ago with an eye-catching promise to cut VAWG by half within a decade, but Angiolini points out that the government’s strategy for delivering on the promise has yet to be revealed. No one should be surprised. Violence against women is a more reliable producer of reports than measures that might give sexual predators pause. There is a familiar pattern here, beginning with uproar in the media when a particularly egregious offender is finally exposed, followed by the panicked commissioning of yet another report. The conviction in 2009 of John Worboys, the taxi driver who drugged and raped women who got into his cab, was rapidly followed by the Stern review. The then home secretary, Theresa May, gave the Stern report an effusive welcome. “Our comprehensive and detailed action plan sets out how we are going to tackle these crimes – supporting those at risk, helping victims and ensuring offenders are brought to justice”, she declared. I don’t doubt she was sincere, but by 2021 a sharp drop in the number of rape prosecutions prompted the then government to set up an “end-to-end rape review”. Three years later, things were even worse, leading Labour to describe the number of prosecutions as “shamefully low” in its 2024 election manifesto. So many reviews, so much hand-wringing, yet impunity remains the norm for the vast majority of rapists. The reason is not hard to find: sexual violence is a crime that prompts more scrutiny of the victim than the offender. Until very recently, traumatised women were told an investigation could not go ahead unless they signed a form giving detectives access to their work and home computers, school and medical records since birth, and handed over their mobile phones. No such demands were made of suspects, even though text messages and habitual use of violent porn might be relevant to building a case. Disbelief is at the heart of this scandalous situation. Not just disbelief of individual women, although that’s bad enough, but an underlying attitude among some officers that rape doesn’t really exist – and a reluctance by police chiefs and ministers to make it grounds for dismissal. Three years ago, a report for the National Police Chiefs’ Council and the Home Office admitted that investigations were being hampered by officers who dismissed rape reports as “regretful sex”. The claim that rape is uniquely difficult to investigate becomes ever weaker in an era of CCTV and mobile phones. But the quality of investigations is undeniably affected by the calibre of the officers carrying them out, some of whom inhabit a culture (like that alleged at Charing Cross in central London) where misogyny and racism is rife. That’s why Angiolini’s insistence that “perpetrators must be the focus” could not be more timely or welcome. So is David Lammy’s announcement on Tuesday that rape victims will no longer be portrayed as serial liars in courtrooms. Victim blaming has been allowed to flourish in the criminal justice system for far too long, encouraged by a failure to root out police officers who share the mindset of perpetrators.

commentisfree_2025_dec_03_state-library-victoria-cuts-changes.txt,opinion,2025-12-02,Gideon Haigh,I have a lifelong connection to Victoria’s state library – which is why I am aghast at its crude self-lobotomy,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/03/state-library-victoria-cuts-changes,"Pardon me that this is a little personal. I first visited the State Library of Victoria aged 12. I held books retrieved from its mountainous stacks with trembling hands. Its stupendous card catalogue blew my schoolboy mind. Search my name in the modern electronic counterpart today and it appears 125 times, mostly for works I researched there. My 84-year-old mother has been a volunteer library tour guide for more than a decade. That doesn’t make me special, by the way. A helluva lot of Victorians feel strongly connected to the library, an institution in the very best of senses. Which is why we are aghast at the apparent enshittification of its core functions mooted by management’s ‘Strategic Reorganisation Change Proposal’, which would cut almost 40 jobs, and more than halve the number of reference librarians, whose numbers were halved as recently as 2019. By the end of this crude self-lobotomy, it is envisaged that the world’s third busiest library, which receives nearly 3 million in-person visits a year, will have only 10 reference librarians. It happens that the SLV is simultaneously staging an exhibition about misinformation. Such irony: reference librarians are at the frontline of the battle against the rising tide of fake news and AI slop. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Needless to say, the proposal reads like corporate bullshit bingo. It could concern the workings of any bureaucracy, a bank, or even a factory. Its authors are anonymous. It’s not even obvious it saves any money. That it appears to betray the barest understanding of the institution is unsurprising when you consider that the SLV board is a parade of professional services types – the kind that government is always lending its watch to in order to ask the time – while the role of chief librarian was abolished a decade ago in favour of a ‘CEO’. That ‘CEO’ at the moment is an accountant called John Wicks, formerly the chief operating officer, promoted to the top job on an interim basis when the previous office holder’s contract was not renewed. Wicks has worked extensively in galleries and museums, though, again, not in libraries. That matters. Because any habitué will tell you that things have been out of kilter at the library for a while. Back in April, for example, there was a great fuss about A Mouthful of Dust, a ‘web experience’ of Ned Kelly promising ‘an impressive journey into the heart of Australia’s most notorious outlaw’. A Mouthful of Dust is actually the kind of overblown digital pap designed so Very Important People can coo about ‘innovation’ even as it imparts little useful information and is bound in a few years to look like crap. You also wonder what the library’s founder, Sir Redmond Barry, would make of the SLV’s ongoing fetishising of Kelly, whom Barry, of course, sentenced to death. A further bad sign came a few months ago when management invited tenders for the lease of its downstairs space at the corner of Swanston and La Trobe Streets – occupied for the past seven years by Mr Tulk, the library’s bright and beloved cafe. Proprietor Michael Togias has thrown heart and soul into building ‘the people’s cafe for the people’s library’, soldiering on through the disruptions of renovations, road works and Covid. A convoluted and opaque process ended with the lease’s awarding to The Big Group, a corporate catering behemoth as inviting as its name. Michael did tell me a funny story about being introduced to the CEO though. Wicks seems to have thought that Michael was ‘Mr Tulk’ himself – in fact, the cafe is named for the inaugural state librarian, Augustus, whose portrait hangs in the Redmond Barry Reading Room. If that’s so, I can’t help feeling that this is a telling sign. The people running the library seem not to see their institution as a library at all, in the sense of furthering the diffusion of knowledge or the nourishment of community. They see it as a cultural destination or an events space, the books and artefacts serving a largely scenic purpose. This would explain present trends, whose logical conclusion being a library without librarians – the perfect counterpoint to Yes Minister’s hospital without patients. The reference librarians at the SLV represent centuries of institutional knowledge. They know the collection in all its stupendous detail; they’re also the people who’ll cheerfully locate that book that may have been misshelved, fix that temperamental microfiche reader, and carry out any one of a myriad daily tasks, for veteran users or first-time visitors alike. So, yes, this is personal, but it’s also global. If the suits can come for the State Library of Victoria, they can come for anyone, and no public institution is safe. On the weekend, by the way, I showed the library to Tom Holland, one half of the juggernaut that is the podcast The Rest Is History, ahead of its sold-out live show. He was, like me those many decades ago, blown away. I then explained to him the Strategic Reorganisation Change Proposal. ‘That is so, so stupid,’ he said. And it is.

Not CEOs, bankers or even doctors, but teachers. No wonder, then, that teaching vacancies are at the highest level ever. Workload is the top concern that teachers cite for leaving the profession, with almost as many quitting as those who joined last year. The consequences are stark: a quarter of English schools do not have a physics teacher, and many key subjects aren’t being offered at A-level in the poorest places. The 4 Day Week Foundation believes that a shorter working week could alleviate these pressures if trialled in a way similar to the Scottish proposals of a four-day week, with a flexible fifth day that allows dedicated time for marking and lesson preparation. This means the work that teachers are currently forced to do at weekends and evenings would be integrated into the working week instead of being unpaid overtime. The foundation is not proposing sending pupils home for a whole extra day, which should assuage parents’ concerns about having to pay for childcare. Instead, it suggests teachers get a four-day week in the classroom, while schools remain open five days. The argument should be compelling for a government that has pledged to hire 6,500 new teachers to deal with the ongoing crisis, but without any clear plans of how to do so. There are understandable concerns from school leaders. Many say that they barely have the funds to meet current demands, let alone introduce new working patterns, and they warn that arranging reliable, high-quality cover for staff could be expensive. A shift to shorter weeks would inevitably mean reworking timetables as well. Ministers are backing flexible working in teaching, but progress has been too slow. Schools that have experimented with new working patterns are already seeing results. The academy chain Dixons introduced a nine-day fortnight last year and boosted retention by 43%. The Education Endowment Foundation found that teachers value protected time for marking, smaller classes and basic healthcare as much as a 10% pay rise. With schools spending £1.25bn on supply teaching every year – mostly to agencies that often pay teachers around half of what they charge schools – reducing burnout would save money as well as staff. Some worry that a shorter week might harm academic outcomes. But research by the Autonomy thinktank on the small number of schools that have innovated seems to suggest the opposite. The Community Schools Trust in Forest Gate, east London, which opted for a four-and-a-half-day week in 2022, saw its results improve the following year, and claims that staff are much happier too. Teachers in England work some of the longest hours of all OECD countries, averaging 51 hours a week. No wonder many flee abroad for better working conditions. The government has tried – and largely failed – to lure overseas talent with £10,000 relocation bonuses. Teachers need to stop being forced into pathological overwork. The four-day working week campaign is not asking for a radical restructuring of schools, simply that teachers have a better work-life balance. Cash must be found. This isn’t a perk; it’s a necessary reform to stop a system collapsing. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He wants the glory of having brokered a deal and does not care whether it is fair or not. As for Vladimir Putin, he only wants peace on terms that achieve things which the Russian army has failed to manage with force. The Kremlin demands territory not yet won on the battlefield and limitations to Ukraine’s capacity to act as a fully sovereign state. Mr Trump has never shown much natural aversion to giving Mr Putin what he wants. He has not applied serious pressure on the Kremlin to end its aggression, nor rebuked the Russian president for starting the war. He sees nothing wrong with a process that discusses the fate of a country, including de facto partition of its territory, without representatives of that country at the table. If Ukraine’s interests are factored into White House thinking at all, it is down to assiduous diplomacy by its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and his European allies. Their interventions have so far prevented Mr Trump selling Kyiv out completely, much to the Kremlin’s frustration. This week’s trip to Moscow by the White House envoy, Steve Witkoff – usually a credulous audience for Russian negotiators – produced no breakthrough. Mr Putin attributes the impasse to “sabotage” of the process by Nato’s European members. He treats any recognition of Ukrainian interests as an attack on Russian national dignity. Russian propaganda often singles Britain out as a villain in this regard – something that Sir Keir Starmer should take as a compliment in recognition of his service to the cause of Ukrainian self-defence. The prime minister deserves credit for his part in the combined European effort to counteract White House pandering to Mr Putin and for his leading role in coordinating a “coalition of the willing” to show unwavering solidarity with Mr Zelenskyy. Correcting Mr Trump’s pro-Russian biases is a sisyphean task. The diplomatic effort must be constantly sustained. Meanwhile, European leaders must always be attentive to their duty to build autonomous capacity to protect the continent. On that front, Sir Keir is less consistent. He has agreed a European defence and security agreement in principle and, in recent weeks, he has spoken with growing conviction about the need for closer EU cooperation. In practice, the rapprochement has stalled, in part for want of political impetus from Downing Street. In a speech earlier this week, the prime minister restated his insistence that there is no dilemma when it comes to relations with Europe and the US. That view is either naive or disingenuous. Mr Trump is not a reliable ally to Europe or anyone else. He sometimes speaks of the EU with undiluted hostility. His trade policy recognises no mutual strategic interests, only clients and enemies. That prejudice is not unique to the current president. It is embedded in Republican ideology. It would be unwise for any European country to bet its national interest on transatlantic partnership. Mr Trump’s indulgence of Russian arguments over Ukraine is a warning. In an even bigger security crisis, could Washington be counted on to take Europe’s side against the Kremlin? That the answer is uncertain should compel Sir Keir to accelerate his claimed ambition of restored closeness to Europe. Vague aspirations must now urgently become concrete deals.

commentisfree_2025_dec_03_trump-national-guard-shooting-anti-immigration-push.txt,opinion,2025-12-03,Mohamad Bazzi,Trump is using a tragic shooting to demonize millions,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/03/trump-national-guard-shooting-anti-immigration-push,"After two national guard members were ambushed in Washington DC last week, killing one and leaving the other in critical condition, Donald Trump went on a hate-filled social media rant and vowed to “permanently pause migration from all Third World countries”. Trump’s late night Thanksgiving posts devolved into a fury, evidently because the suspected gunman is an Afghan national. He had worked with the US government, including the CIA, and was evacuated to the US in 2021 after the American military withdrew from Afghanistan. The president lashed out at millions of immigrants, painting them as “illegal and disruptive populations” and he pledged to “end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens”. Trump also proclaimed that US citizenship should be stripped from naturalized immigrants “who undermine domestic tranquility”, and called for deporting those he deemed “non-compatible with western civilization”. Within hours of the shooting on 26 November, it became clear that Trump and several of his top aides would use the tragedy not only to collectively punish thousands of Afghans in the US, but to further intensify the administration’s crackdown on immigrant communities across the country. After the Wall Street Journal warned in an editorial against blaming all Afghan refugees for the violent actions of one man, Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s nativist immigration policy and White House deputy chief of staff, retorted on X: “This is the great lie of mass migration.” Miller added: “You are not just importing individuals. You are importing societies … At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.” Trump and Miller’s grandstanding obscures an inconvenient reality: it was the US that largely broke Afghanistan, and destroyed the ability of many Afghans to live in their homeland – after the US invaded in 2001 following the 11 September terrorist attacks. In the generation since George W Bush’s administration unleashed its global war on terror – invading and occupying Afghanistan and Iraq, and carrying out repeated airstrikes in other countries – the US has failed to reckon with all the ways its legacy of violence abroad eventually comes home. Under both Democratic and Republican presidents, the US is also prone to shifting blame for its foreign policy disasters on to others, and to abandon any sense of moral responsibility for the local allies it leaves behind in places like Afghanistan and Iraq – and Vietnam before that. What we know so far about the suspect in last week’s shooting, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, fits the classic pattern of “blowback”, a term coined by intelligence officials to describe the unintended consequences of violence perpetuated by US military operations. Lakanwal, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and assault, was part of a CIA-backed Afghan military group known as a “Zero Unit”, which carried out missions to capture or kill suspected militants in southern Afghanistan. For years, these paramilitary units were dogged by accusations that they mainly functioned as CIA-sanctioned death squads. In 2019, a Human Rights Watch report found that the Zero Units were “responsible for extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances, indiscriminate airstrikes, attacks on medical facilities, and other violations of international humanitarian law, or the laws of war”. Lakanwal entered the US in September 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a program launched by Joe Biden’s administration to evacuate and resettle tens of thousands of Afghans, after the chaotic US military withdrawal in late August. Many of those evacuated had worked alongside US troops and diplomats, and would likely be branded as traitors by the Taliban if they had stayed in Afghanistan. But Lakanwal had trouble adjusting to life in the US, and his mental health seemed to be unraveling for years, according to emails obtained by the Associated Press. He was unable to hold a steady job, and alternated between dark stretches of isolation and taking sudden cross-country drives that lasted for weeks. At times, according to the emails sent to a refugee service organization, he spent weeks in a “darkened room, not speaking to anyone, not even his wife or older kids”. A childhood friend of Lakanwal, who was interviewed in Afghanistan last week by the New York Times, said Lakanwal had struggled with mental health issues and was distressed by the casualties his unit had caused during its operations, especially night-time raids intended to capture Taliban members. “When he saw blood, bodies, and the wounded, he could not tolerate it, and it put a lot of pressure on his mind,” the friend said. It will take time to understand Lakanwal’s motivation for allegedly shooting two national guard members – and a potential trial could reveal new details about the CIA’s role in recruiting and training Afghans into paramilitary units that allegedly committed human rights abuses. But Trump and others in his administration seem eager to weaponize this attack as part of their foundational myth of US exceptionalism: foreigners import violence and chaos into the US from broken and bankrupt homelands. Without immigrants, Trump’s argument goes, the US would be safe and would thrive. In his second term, Trump has taken his message as a populist demagogue to a global stage, bragging about the US immigration crackdown in his unhinged hour-long speech to the UN general assembly in September. He called on European countries to emulate his policies, close their borders and expel migrants. “It’s time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now,” Trump lectured western leaders, adding casually: “Your countries are going to hell.” Trump is more open in his demagogy than other politicians, who prefer to stay quiet about their notions of national superiority and US exceptionalism. But Trump’s transactional worldview lays bare a core tenet of US foreign policy: America will always prioritize its short-term security and economic interests over promoting democracy and human rights – no matter what lofty rhetoric past presidents used to obscure US military interventions and foreign meddling. Even before the Bush administration invaded in 2001, Afghanistan had suffered from at least a decade of past US interference. In the 1980s, the CIA funneled billions of dollars (mostly through Pakistan’s intelligence service) to arm and train thousands of Afghan mujahideen to fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. It was the last great cold war battle between the US and the Soviet Union – and some experts argue the Afghanistan war was a significant factor behind the Soviet empire’s collapse. After the Soviets withdrew in defeat in 1989, the US largely left the country to the mercy of Afghan warlords and neighboring Pakistan. Afghanistan suffered through years of civil war, until the Taliban emerged in 1994 and consolidated control over most of the country within a few years. Aside from driving out the Soviets, the CIA-financed jihad in the 1980s left another legacy: an estimated 20,000 foreign volunteers, most of them Arabs, had joined the fight in Afghanistan over a decade. These so-called “Afghan Arabs” received military training, set up networks and gained battlefield experience that they were eager to use elsewhere. Among those who joined the anti-Soviet jihad was Osama bin Laden and the Egyptian militant Ayman al-Zawahiri, along with other founding members of al-Qaida. While there’s no public evidence that the CIA financed or trained foreign fighters in Afghanistan, the Afghan war produced enormous blowback that reverberated for decades. The foreign veterans fought in multiple conflicts in the 1990s, including Algeria, Bosnia, Kosovo and Chechnya. Other veterans went back to their home countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, where they took leading roles in jihadist groups and sometimes carried out terrorist strikes. And of course, Bin Laden and Zawahiri planned the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington while they were sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Those attacks became the rationale for the US invasion of Afghanistan, which turned into America’s longest overseas war, stretching for two decades. That conflict has shaped a generation of Afghans, who have experienced the terror that US military power and its proxies can inflict. But rather than confront the devastation that Americans have wrought on Afghanistan, Trump and his acolytes are eager to demonize the people of a “broken” country – one the US helped destroy.

He deserves to stay in America,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/04/ali-faqirzada-refugee-deserves-to-stay-america,"On 14 October, Ali Faqirzada – an Afghan refugee, a resident of New Paltz, New York, and a computer science student at Bard College – arrived for an interview at a federal immigration office on Long Island. He was applying for political asylum, a designation for which he was – and remains – a perfect candidate. In his native country, Faqirzada had assisted the American government and Nato with projects designed to improve the lives of Afghan women and help them get an education. But after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the ministry where he, his mother and sister had worked was bombed by the Taliban, and one of its employees was murdered. Understandably concerned that they would be tortured and killed like so many Afghans targeted by the Taliban for their cooperation with humanitarian agencies, the Faqirzadas made their way to Mexico, and from there to the US, where they immediately applied for refugee status. Six family members have already been granted asylum after having successfully made the case that repatriation to their Taliban-controlled homeland would probably mean a death sentence. When Ali Faqirzada went for his 14 October interview, it seemed probable that his petition would also be approved. According to Malia Dumont, a military veteran formerly deployed in Afghanistan and now chief of staff and vice-president for strategy and policy at Bard, Ali is a brilliant, generous, community-minded student who has worked in New York state as a hospital security guard, a position of great trust and responsibility. In a more reasonable, more compassionate country, the immigration official would have walked around the table, shaken Faqirzada’s hand, and thanked him for how much he has done on behalf of his people and our own. In a more recognizably American country, the interviewer would have congratulated Ali on how obviously he is thriving in his adopted land and on the good chance that he will go on to make valuable contributions to our society. But that is not what happened. That is not how the story went in Donald Trump and Stephen Miller’s America. Immediately following his interview, during which he convinced the authorities that his claim of “credible fear” was justified, Faqirzada was arrested by ICE agents and sent to the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, a for-profit prison operated by the GEO Group. He has been there ever since, in a cell with 12 other men, where his access to books, water, and halal food has been severely restricted. According to visitors, he has devoted his energies to maintaining the morale and the welfare of his fellow inmates. The merits of Ali’s case and the sheer absurdity of the suggestion that the genial, well-liked college student could pose any sort of terrorist threat has prompted an outpouring of popular support. Among his advocates are Leon Botstein, president of Bard College and himself a refugee from the Nazis, who has stated that wisest course in such situations is to be as vocal – to make as much noise – as possible. Others who have spoken out on Faqirzada’s behalf include the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, Congressman Pat Ryan, a Democrat of New York, the communities of New Paltz and Stone Ridge, New York, and the Episcopal bishop Matthew Heyd, who led a vigil in November outside Delaney Hall. Their efforts to free Faqirzada have been complicated by a 29 November government ruling that has paused the final approval of all asylum applications. It’s the newest and most drastic addition to a series of recent measures – including the temporary cessation of the US Refugee Admissions Program on 20 January – that have made the process of asylum-seeking steadily more challenging. In addition, there is now a pause on new immigration from Afghanistan and on the issuing of green cards to Afghans already residing in the United States. Decisions on the granting of asylum are made by the Department of Homeland Security and not the judiciary, thus making it easier for the Trump administration to drastically curtail the flow of refugees. The sweeping new changes targeting Afghans were enacted in the aftermath of the tragic Washington DC shooting of two national guard soldiers, one fatally, by an Afghan national who had worked with the CIA and whose application for asylum had been thoroughly vetted and approved. Common sense – a trait that the Republican party has claimed as an essential aspect of their political agenda – suggests that a genial, kind-hearted, highly motivated computer science student and hospital security guard should not be held accountable for someone else’s crime. Nor should the entire Afghan community, many members of which have fled great danger at home, be punished for the actions of one man and made to worry about whatever safety and stability they have managed to find in our country. There is great confusion, uncertainty and a dispiriting lack of clarity about what precisely these new measures mean and how to proceed from here. Many questions remain about Ali Faqirzada’s detention. How long will he continue to be held prisoner at Delaney Hall? How will the new rulings affect his chances of being granted the protections he clearly deserves? But perhaps the most important questions are the ones that we have been asking ourselves since January 2025 and that we will likely ask ourselves for years to come. How did we let this happen – and what can we do about it now?

Only to litigants whose cases have crashed and burned,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/04/bruce-lehrmann-an-inspiration-only-to-litigants-whose-cases-have-crashed-and-burned,"Bruce Lehrmann is an “inspiration”. Of course he is. At least his solicitor-advocate, Zali Burrows, is urging us to see him that way because he inspires those who have been “wrongly accused”. That may confuse those who were thinking, up this point, that it was Bruce who was doing the accusing – accusing the people at Channel 10 and its former star presenter Lisa Wilkinson of getting it so wrong. Then accusing the trial judge, Michael Lee, of getting it utterly wrong, requiring Bruce to courageously try to retrieve, again, what’s left of his well-munched hat. In some special corners of the land and beyond, there could be people drawing inspiration from Bruce Lehrmann – people who are in Long Bay bravely maintaining their innocence or litigants whose cases have crashed and burned and can’t pay the costs. Victims, all – just as Bruce is a victim. Even though he is a victim of his own folly that shouldn’t mean that he’s not an inspiration, in the same way as those who overcome terrible adversities or make marvellous life-enhancing scientific and artistic contributions. Bruce Lehrmann’s mission has been to expand the boundaries of inspiration-hood. He’s holding a torch for all of us. Certainly, Burrows’ pronouncement makes a nice change from her description last August when she said of her client, “He’s pretty much become the national joke ... Australia’s most hated man.” That is not to say that inspiring or even hated people aren’t capable of making stupid mistakes. One of Bruce’s mistakes was to embark on litigation in the first place. My hunch is that he thought Brittany Higgins would not get into the witness box because of her fragile mental state. She had been in and out of hospital after collapsing and her condition deteriorated after Linda Reynolds’ litigation cranked into gear. Lehrmann’s legal team was confident they would have a clear run to success without the respondents being able to prove a truth defence. However, once Higgins saw Lehrmann’s disastrous evidence, she put up her hand. Justice Lee later said, “To remark that Mr Lehrmann was a poor witness is an exercise in understatement.” While Lee disbelieved aspects of Higgins’ evidence he accepted the crucial elements, which allowed him to find that on the balance of probabilities Lehrmann had raped her on Senator Linda Reynolds’ ministerial couch. On that basis the justification (truth) defence succeeded. Thank you Brittany. In 2023, Bruce was feeling as though a rainbow had struck his posterior. He’d scooped up close to $500,000 in settlements with the ABC and News Corp – the price they paid for not wanting to get into the Colosseum. Large chunks of that would have kept his lawyers ready and willing. Actually, Bruce has little to no financial exposure to these courtroom misadventures. The Channel 10 people are out of pocket, and so too the lawyers who staked him at trial. Even though the appellant doesn’t have a brass razoo, in October last year Justice Wendy Abraham in the federal court said the poor lamb doesn’t have to provide security for costs before launching his appeal against Justice Lee’s findings. It’s a free home run, forget the $2m already on the meter and payable to Ten. Now another half-million for the appeal can be added to that unrecoverable pile of financial compost. It’s been remarked by people who closely observe the courts that the defamation game is running out of puff. After Ben Roberts-Smith, Bruce Lehrmann and Munjed Al Muderis, why would anyone think the courts are the best place to varnish their reputation? Even those who “win” are out of pocket. Linda Reynolds’ damages of $341,000, with costs most likely to be in excess of $1.5m, are unlikely to be satisfied by Higgins. Joe Hockey in his “Treasurer for Sale” case against the Sydney Morning Herald ended up underwater. He asked for $1m and was awarded $200,000 and only received 15% of his costs. Actor Geoffrey Rush was given a restorative $2.8m by Justice Michael Wigney in his action against the Daily Telegraph, yet that did little to enhance his glittering career. Little wonder those who the SMH and the Age recently described as “grasping defamation lawyers” have turned their attention to the new fertile uplands of serious invasions of privacy. Some of Bruce’s ardent supporters have gone quiet, including the Presumption of Innocence Squad under the baton of Bettina Arndt. His old pals at News Corp, who insisted he should never have been prosecuted for rape, have moved on to lavishly advocate for another determined litigant, the guardian of the office couch, former senator Linda Reynolds. Yet Bruce has not completely run out of possibilities for providing further inspiration. A while ago he was hoping the ACT government would buy him a house, however the threatened litigation over his prosecution for rape seems to have disappeared. More recently, he wants court orders to get the commonwealth to pay for his defence in a Corruption Commission investigation into his use or misuse of government documents. And now there’s the possibility of a special leave application to the high court. Never say die for Australia’s most hated, inspirational man. Richard Ackland publishes Justinian and Spilled Ink"
commentisfree_2025_dec_04_europe-trump-putin-plans-ukraine-nato.txt,opinion,2025-12-04,Martin Kettle,Europe is holding the line against Trump’s and Putin’s plans for Ukraine. But it won’t be able to for ever,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/04/europe-trump-putin-plans-ukraine-nato,"The failure of this week’s peace talks between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff fits into a now well-established pattern of standoffs on Ukraine during Trump’s second term. But the dynamic that produced these talks may be becoming more entrenched. The US and Russian interests driving the process have not changed, while the conflict on the ground is intensifying. The lack of progress this week means there will be another attempt to end the war soon, and perhaps another after that, until, one day, there is some kind of US-backed deal to halt the conflict on terms broadly favouring Russia. The geopolitical algorithm driving this effort is too consistent to ignore. It has been repeated ever since Trump re-entered the White House in January. On the campaign trail, Trump had claimed he could stop the war in a day. That was never going to happen. But from 12 February onwards, when Trump first talked directly to Putin about Ukraine, the intention and approach have not altered. There is no reason to suppose they will do so now. Indeed, Tuesday’s impasse may spur them on again. The internal logic of the interactions that have brought us to this point is familiar by now. Trump refuses to give arms to Ukraine. Instead he attempts a bilateral deal with Putin to stop the war at Ukraine’s territorial expense. Russia bombs Ukraine and makes attritional battlefield progress. Ukraine and its other allies mobilise to challenge any emerging pro-Russian deal. The US rebalances its plans to take account of the objections. Talks take place. Putin says no deal. The war continues, but so does the diplomacy. As this process repeats itself, as it will, one of two things will happen. Either the process will be recognised as achieving nothing, or some aspect of it will be changed to make an outcome more likely. The first option, abandonment of the process, is a possibility, but this would mean humiliation for Trump. It would also mean the war would intensify and become more lethal, destructive and destabilising. Pressures to stop it would thus recur, leading to the resumption of the US diplomatic effort, but from a weaker position than today. The second option, the alteration or bypassing of some aspect of the process, therefore seems more likely. This inevitably places Nato and Europe firmly in the crosshairs of Moscow, in particular, and also of Washington. It explains why the Kremlin hinted yesterday that there were still agreements worth making – agreements, in other words, between Russia and the US, from which Europe is excluded. Putin could not be clearer that he sees Europe as Trump’s weak link. “Europe is preventing the US administration from achieving peace on Ukraine,” he said before the talks with Witkoff this week. “They are on the side of war,” he said a little later. “Russia does not intend to fight Europe, but if Europe starts, we are ready right now.” Some of this is nonsense. But Putin’s key insight is right. Europe – more accurately Nato minus the US – is indeed managing to frustrate Trump from making the kind of deal with Putin that he wants. The Nato allies’ consistent dedication to this task has not been widely celebrated, for fear of provoking Trump, but it is impossible to miss. The effort has been intense, from the moment that Trump and JD Vance publicly abused Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his Oval Office visit on 28 February. It has also been more or less successful. This so-called “coalition of the willing” has the power to wound US-Russia plans, but it lacks the power to shape them. The coalition involves most European nations, plus Canada, all of whom have committed to material support for postwar Ukraine. Its aims have been pursued ad hoc, and partly within Nato, as in yesterday’s foreign ministers’ meeting at Nato HQ in Brussels, from which the US secretary of state Marco Rubio was conspicuously absent. Either way, the European scramble on Ukraine’s behalf has repeatedly managed to hold the line against Trump and Putin. It did so again this week when the Witkoff plan was tweaked before the Putin meeting. Hugging Zelenskyy closer has been a key part of this effort ever since the Oval Office disaster. It would be surprising if Zelenskyy was not being intensively advised and consulted by the allies at almost every turn. I would bet that, if we ever get access to a log of his messages, memos, meetings and travels, we will find that Keir Starmer’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, plays a big role in this effort. Yet this cannot and will not continue indefinitely. The central problem for both Ukraine and Europe is that the 21st-century imbalance of power is turned against them. In this new imbalance, Europe and Nato have not enough arms, power or wealth to leverage an alternative peace settlement that Russia and the US are compelled to take seriously or accept. The postwar idea of the west may not be dead, but it is in intensive care. European and some American surgeons are battling with all the skill at their disposal to keep it alive. The truth, though, is that Trump could very easily pull the plug tomorrow. If that were to happen, the danger of Russian troops eventually marching down Whitehall might remain remote. But the threat to Kyiv’s main street, Khreshchatyk, would undoubtedly increase. Whether Trump grasps this, or cares, is hard to say. It is not impossible that an effective Ukrainian government, whether headed by Zelenskyy or not, could continue to function and win the financial and military support of international backers to begin reconstruction. Much would depend on whether the west’s frozen Russian assets, worth £253bn, ended up in Kyiv or are returned to Moscow. Either way, Nato could then prove to be yesterday’s solution to tomorrow’s threat. The Nato nations would all still have their weapons and armed forces. They would retain their commitment to an independent Ukraine and to their common values. They would also continue to possess what the London-based historian Georgios Varouxakis, author of the widely praised The West: The History of an Idea, calls their “capacity for self-criticism and self-correction”. But the strategic self-correction required of Europe in the absence of a fully committed US partner would be arduous, and could involve a price tag that few European nations and voters would be willing to pay. It may not be true, yet, that Trump’s US has reached a fateful fork in the road, where it decides to choose between Europe and Ukraine on the one hand, and Russia on the other. But that place and that moment are getting closer than at any time since 1945. The looming tragedy is that history has conferred upon Europe a role in support of Ukraine that it is ultimately unable to fulfil to anything like the degree required.

commentisfree_2025_dec_04_messy-combative-dont-write-off-your-party-corbyn-sultana.txt,opinion,2025-12-04,Andy Beckett,"Messy, combative and intoxicatingly fierce – don’t write off Your Party just yet",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/04/messy-combative-dont-write-off-your-party-corbyn-sultana,"It’s not every day that Jeremy Corbyn and some of his closest comrades are described as “the right” in a political argument. But I first heard them given that potentially lethal label – for socialists, at least – shortly after arriving at Your Party’s acrimonious founding conference in Liverpool last Sunday. The young man who used the words did not seem to be one of the hardbitten leftwing fanatics who had taken over the party, according to most of the press. He was attending his first political conference and enjoying it immensely. Which faction did he think was ahead, I asked, in the weekend’s maze of votes and debates? “Not the Corbynists,” he said with a grin. “But us – the left!” Ever since its chaotic launch in July, Your Party has been seen by many voters and journalists – when they have noticed it at all – as a step-by-step demonstration of the futility of leftwing politics. Through ideological disagreements, disorganisation and delays, domineering personalities and disputes over leadership structure, management of funds and membership data, Your Party has seemingly squandered the opportunity offered by Labour’s rightward shift and record unpopularity. Instead, Zack Polanski’s radicalised Green party has become the preferred vehicle for many leftwing voters, thinkers and activists. Meanwhile, Your Party has been marked, by both enemies and disillusioned potential supporters, for either a quick or lingering death. From this perspective, the Liverpool conference’s onstage rows, open factional divisions and competing purists of the left simply further confirmed the party’s fate. Yet could it be premature and simplistic to see the Your Party saga this way? One lesson of British and wider western politics over the past decade, still insufficiently learned by mainstream parties and commentators, is that rebellions should not be written off, even when they seem to be failing or contained. In discontented times, with conventional politics widely disliked and increasingly discredited, revolts against it can subside and then flare up again, or leave remnants that fuel more insurrections. From Scottish nationalism to Euroscepticism and Corbynism, rebellions have survived setbacks to reappear in new, sometimes stronger forms. Your Party’s messy existence might be a beginning rather than an ending. Over the past year, as I’ve spent time in the milieu that eventually produced the party, I’ve met a striking number of activists who don’t fit the media’s usual leftwing categories. Often quite young but politically experienced, strongly committed to the left but not sectarian, keen on building coalitions rather than maintaining ideological purity, and not particularly reverent towards Corbyn or Your Party’s other leading personality, the MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana, these activists have found the party’s splits and tantrums infuriating. “This whole process has been led from the top by two politicians who have incredibly machiavellian, pushy advisers … engaged in bitter trench warfare,” one of these activists told me, as the conference was getting under way with a disastrous flurry of delegate barrings, ejections and boycotts – most damagingly, by Sultana herself. “Everyone I know who was keen is now totally dejected. We were very close to getting everyone on the grassroots left inside the tent.” Yet on the final day of the conference, he was suddenly much cheerier: “The programme we wanted has won all its votes. Zarah has basically signed up to it.” The party would be led by an elected committee of ordinary members – not by a single leader, as Corbyn and “the right” had wanted – and members would be allowed to be in other political parties as well. “The members have taken control,” Sultana declared to a crowd of journalists, before finally deigning to enter the conference hall. The speech she then made there was intoxicatingly fierce: attacking “the parasites” who own privatised utilities, and the mainstream politicians and corporate interests who would “lead us into fascism to protect their wealth and power”. Your Party, she vowed, would be “a party that belongs not to nameless, faceless, unelected bureaucrats” – a swipe at Corbyn’s advisers – “but to you”. Inadvertently, the speech made the tension between her rare gifts as a communicator – and therefore her tendency to dominate political situations – and her advocacy of Your Party as a collective endeavour very clear. Next year, the party promises to “commence a review into different options for future leadership models”. Before and after she spoke, there were debates about the structure, workings and purpose of the party. The audiences were larger than most of those at this year’s Tory conference, and livelier than at Labour’s. A diverse succession of delegates made combative speeches, ignored the chair’s orders to keep to time limits, and were almost constantly applauded or heckled. The lack of deference towards rules and hierarchies felt startling – and refreshing: a throwback to the unruly Labour conferences of the 1970s, or a prototype for a participatory politics to come. Shortly before the conference, a YouGov poll showed that 12% of Britons “would consider” voting for Your Party. While down by a third since the party’s launch, the figure was still surprisingly high given the turmoil, and the fact that no party scored more than 29%. Our politics remains in a fragmented and volatile state, not least because Labour, Reform and the Tories share some of Your Party’s problems: divisive leading figures, widely disbelieved approaches to reviving the country, and hostility from most voters. The Greens and Liberal Democrats currently have fewer negative associations. But the Lib Dems’ opportunistic, ambiguous politics is unlikely to lure many of Your Party’s consistently socialist supporters. Meanwhile the Greens, despite Polanski’s canny leftwing populism and appealingly direct manner, can’t match Your Party’s connections to working class, trade union and anti-racist politics. The Greens’ leftward shift is also heavily dependent on Polanski, who has limited powers as leader, and, assuming he wants to carry on, will have to stand for re-election in 2027. So Your Party may survive, at least until the next general election, when winning a few seats – it currently has four – could give it leverage in a hung parliament. To maximise its chances, the party appears to be moving towards an agreement with the Greens not to stand in each other’s target seats. Was this politics of survival, small gains, and participation as an end in itself, what people were expecting when they started talking about a new leftwing party in packed rooms a year ago? My sense is yes. With good reason, there are fewer wild optimists and more realists on the British left than there used to be. Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_dec_04_simon-cowell-tv-search-boyband.txt,opinion,2025-12-04,Emma Brockes,Watch Simon Cowell’s TV search for a new boyband – and see how our world has changed,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/04/simon-cowell-tv-search-boyband,"There is a moment in the trailer for Simon Cowell’s new Netflix show, The Next Act, that is almost touching in its adherence to the way things once were. Cowell, who we see on a variety of beige sofas primly clutching his knees, talks about how to curate a new boyband, 20 years after the launch of his first TV talent show. “There is a huge risk here,” he says, heavy with drama. “If this goes wrong, it will be: ‘Simon Cowell has lost it.’” In fact, as anyone who has an eye on dwindling audience figures for his existing shows knows, for the vast majority of 18- to 24-year-olds – or even for younger millennials – the more likely response will be, “Simon who?” Which doesn’t mean that a new generation of viewers can’t be lured in by Cowell’s expertise. The question of whether 66-year-old Cowell can tweak a dusty and decades-old model has less to do with current music trends – just as well, since pop music has moved from TV to TikTok, which Cowell says he hates – than the music executive’s extremely well-tested ability to make good TV and bend his persona to align with the times. In the rollout of publicity for the new show, Cowell has made a good fist of expressing regret at how rude he used to be to contestants, apologising in the New York Times, after some cajoling, for “being a dick”, and putting his eye-rolling, grimacing performance as a judge down to the tedium of audition days rather than what most of us understood it to be: the extraction of lolz out of confused individuals who had the misfortune to appear on his shows. Anyway, we’ve heard it all before; Cowell has been making these sorts of noises after being prodded by journalists for a good 15 years now. He made them to me in 2011 when I visited him at his rental house in the Hollywood Hills, a place of white marble and empty surfaces, and where he spoke about his life from the standpoint of a passive observer. It was, it appeared to me at the time, as if Cowell regarded his personality itself as running on free-market principles over which he had no particular influence – competing elements in which, inevitably, sometimes the baser ones prospered. Whatever the outcome, it came with a shrug and a “What can you do?” It is a babyish dodge common to those who, having done very well, feel under no pressure to explain themselves. Still, I’ve always had a soft spot for Cowell, who combines American drive and ambition with a properly and compellingly odd duck personality that can really only be British. “I’m very odd,” he said at the time. “I am.” The pointy shoes, the funny wardrobe, the awkward physicality; all of which, in the context of LA conformity, still seem to me to be vaguely endearing. You only had to look at the empty mansion to imagine the challenges of that particular interior life. (Cowell has been open about his depression and insomnia.) If he’s a difficult person to work with – and I imagine he is – when Cowell talks about his receptiveness to anyone in his company, from the doorman up, to come to him with a good idea, I believe him. The new show will present an older, softer version of Cowell, whether because that’s who he is these days or because the market requires it, who knows – but it’s a fact communicated in the show by the inclusion of Lauren Silverman, Cowell’s longtime girlfriend and glancing shots of their 11-year-old son, Eric. And while he will, presumably, hold back on all his old judging antics, I’m more curious about the contestants. Namely: what the gen Z, or even gen Alpha boys auditioning for Cowell understand their roles in the new show to be. In their heyday, Cowell’s reality shows were an early precursor to the now common idea of mining your life for content, and I remember very clearly him telling me what a problem it became once contestants realised they’d have a better chance of being picked for X Factor or America’s Got Talent if they had a strong backstory. “I once had a guy,” Cowell said, “who came rushing out on stage and literally shouted, ‘I’ve got cancer!’ Like it was great news. He was so happy that he had a sad story.” The difference these days is that even if the young men competing on Simon Cowell: the Next Act make similar calculations, their social media accounts alone ensure they will have a greater ownership stake in their own stories than their counterparts of the mid-2000s. (Cowell hates phones and claims not to read anything online – augurs well!) The bigger question is whether he can get a face that, like Jeremy Paxman’s, seems in its resting state naturally to describe incredulity, to do something warmer and more friendly, as the era requires. And there it is – the impetus to watch the first episode. Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"

Last month, the government bowed to pressure from campaigners and pledged to make depictions of strangulation illegal. Research showing that a majority of children have viewed this kind of material is extremely disturbing, all the more so given evidence that viewing “choking” makes people – mostly men – more likely to do it in real life. This week, the Guardian examined the distressing effects of deepfake pornography in schools, and interviewed the women behind the successful campaign to criminalise the nonconsensual creation of deepfake intimate images. Ofcom’s announcement that it has issued a £1m fine to a Belize-based pornography company, AVS Group, thus seems timely. Oliver Griffiths, the regulator’s director of online safety, referred on BBC radio to a “tide turning” as enforcement powers in the Online Safety Act take effect. The age-verification checks on AVS’s websites, introduced to protect children, are judged not to be effective enough. If the company does not pay up, Mr Griffiths said that he would move to block the site. One thing everyone connected with online regulation agrees on is that technology is moving at an incredible rate. The danger is that societies, and the systems we use to manage risks, can’t keep up. While it is good to see Ofcom taking action, it is alarming that 90 other companies – 83 of which run pornography sites – are also being investigated, with further fines said to be imminent. Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, warned last month that the regulator was in danger of losing public trust if it did not up the pace of implementation of the Online Safety Act and get on top of emerging threats. Regulation and enforcement in the online space is complicated. When Ofcom issued a £20,000 fine to the controversial forum 4chan, the companies behind it and another forum, Kiwi Farms, filed a legal case. They want a US court to rule that the UK’s online safety laws and codes of conduct do not apply to them. Such challenges make Ofcom’s task harder. But it must not be cowed. Campaigners such as Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly took her own life after viewing harmful material, are right to highlight the moral imperative to make the internet safer for children. They want a new “duty of candour” for public officials to apply to tech companies too, and for the regulator to be more proactive and less passive. This is all made even more urgent by emerging concerns about agentic AI, or chatbots, which stand accused of acting as “suicide coaches” in several US lawsuits. If Ms Kendall believes that there are gaps in current online safety laws, as she said on Wednesday, she must close them. Beeban Kidron, the crossbench peer and online safety campaigner, has laid amendments to the government’s crime and policing bill that would achieve this. Ministers should not drag their heels, as happened with deepfake images. Online safety is not the only area in which Ofcom is accused of damaging inaction. It has also appeared reluctant to tackle racism and misinformation about climate policy on GB News. Regulatory oversight of news and other media have always been important. But in our age of pocket computers, shape-shifting tech and political polarisation, questions about Ofcom’s performance – particularly in relation to children – have arguably never been more pressing."
commentisfree_2025_dec_04_the-guardian-view-on-the-crown-estate-inquiry-a-necessary-probe-and-a-wider-debate.txt,opinion,2025-12-04,Editorial,The Guardian view on the crown estate inquiry: a necessary probe and a wider debate,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-crown-estate-inquiry-a-necessary-probe-and-a-wider-debate,"Everyone in Britain has views about the royal family. In many cases, lots of views. Britain’s parliament, however, never lets the subject pass its lips. By long tradition, the House of Commons prohibits itself from any mention, let alone any discussion, of the monarchy or the royal family. This self-imposed gag – in which a centuries-old constitutional monarchy is unable to discuss constitutional monarchy – is infantilising and indefensible. The gag may, however, be loosening. This week, the Commons public accounts committee announced an inquiry into the crown estate. The probe is a direct response to news that the disgraced former Prince Andrew (now Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor) and his brother Prince Edward have been paying “peppercorn rents” for very extensive properties owned by the estate. It is an extremely unusual move in the modern era. The crown estate is a public body, established by statute in 1961. It is independent of both monarch and government. It is also a highly successful and profitable property company worth an estimated £15.5bn. Since David Cameron abolished the civil list system in 2011, the crown gets a generous and protected “sovereign grant” from the estate’s profits each year. As the estate gets a cut of all offshore wind development, among other things, the sovereign grant has provided a royal windfall that might have gone to the Treasury. The grant is due for review in 2026. It should be part of the new inquiry. Royal finances are an entirely legitimate subject for full parliamentary accountability, and the kind of scrutiny advocated in the Guardian’s Cost of the crown series. As the Treasury accepted last week in a letter to the committee chair, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the estate commissioners have “a statutory duty to maintain and enhance the value of the estate and the returns obtained from it”. In other words, as Sir Geoffrey had earlier informed the Treasury, the estate must provide “value for money”. The committee is therefore doing its job by inquiring whether this is happening. Its findings are likely to generate great public interest, and rightly so. Value for money is a yardstick that inescapably unlocks the wider debate that parliament ought to routinely be holding about the appropriate workings of the monarchy. The inquiry is doubtless unwelcome for Buckingham Palace. But the announcement this week – a week in which David Dimbleby also began a strikingly sceptical BBC One series entitled What’s the Monarchy For? – may be a sign that times are changing for the crown. That is partly because of changing attitudes. More specifically, it is also because the inquiry should lift a stone on the as yet unpublicised terms under which “grace and favour” residences were, and are, allocated. In addition, it should reveal the terms and responsibilities for ensuring their upkeep. This may mean further unwelcome stories for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and for the palace. The committee should not flinch from this task out of misplaced deference. Value for money is a proper and powerful tool of public accountability, whether applied to the NHS or to the monarchy. As the former Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker has argued, the thoroughness of the inquiry will be judged in part by whether it can clarify the number of royal grace-and-favour residences and their costs. According to Mr Baker, in 1993, the last year for which he was able to discover a figure for such residences, there were 272. By contrast, the number of “working” royals stands at 11.

commentisfree_2025_dec_04_wes-streeting-mental-health-problems-review.txt,opinion,2025-12-04,Wes Streeting,I realise now that my view on mental health overdiagnosis was divisive. We all need better evidence,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/04/wes-streeting-mental-health-problems-review,"Earlier this year, I appeared on the BBC and was asked a question by Laura Kuenssberg that I hadn’t anticipated: did I believe there’s a problem with mental health overdiagnosis? I gave a simple answer, that yes, I did think there was overdiagnosis, that too many people were being written off, and too many people weren’t getting the support they needed. I was then deluged with messages and emails of both enthusiastic agreement and visceral disagreement – including from mental health clinicians on both sides of the argument. One angry patient messaged to say: “Far from overdiagnosis, I can’t even get an appointment to get a diagnosis.” The worst thing was that I agreed with them, but I had failed to capture the complexity of this problem. The truth is there has been a massive growth in mental health and behavioural issues and there isn’t a consensus within the mental health clinical community on what is driving it. There was an almost 50% increase in mental health problems among adults between 1993 and 2023. Mental health referrals for children and young people increased by about 50% in just two years during the pandemic. And 13 times more people are waiting for an autism assessment today compared with 2019. Whether this is because people are more open about their mental health, there is growing awareness of these conditions, these are consequences of the pandemic or there have been other drivers, we have got to get to the bottom of the causes of this. Because services are not keeping up. As the Darzi investigation uncovered, around 109,000 young people and children were waiting more than a year for their first appointment with a mental health specialist. This is despite an increase in spending on mental health services by more than 50% since 2019. I know from the personal experience of some of my nearest and dearest the pain this is causing. One has attempted to take their own life after struggling to get any mental health support. A family member has suffered from the shortages of medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, seriously affecting his mental health. At the same time, I have seen the transformational impact an early autism diagnosis can have for the support and education a child receives. It was following my own episode with foot-in-mouth syndrome on live television that I decided this issue was too important to be left unresolved and required a proper evidence base. That’s why my department has asked the esteemed Prof Peter Fonagy, along with Sir Simon Wessely and Prof Gillian Baird, to lead a review into the prevalence and support for mental health conditions, autism and ADHD. The review brings together some of the most respected researchers, clinicians and voluntary organisations in the country, alongside people with lived experience. I’ve asked them to weigh the data, examine the quality of evidence, diagnose the problem and offer recommendations on how the NHS can meet the needs of all. I’m delighted that this review is backed by Mind, the Mental Health Foundation, the National Autistic Society, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and Anne Longfield, the former children’s commissioner for England. All can see the current system is failing, and are motivated by the need to fix it. As Dr Sarah Hughes, Mind’s chief executive, said: “This is a huge opportunity to really understand what is driving increasing levels of mental illness, especially among our young people.” I’m not waiting for the review to conclude to begin turning around our mental health services. Since the election, we’ve recruited more than 7,000 extra mental health staff, we’ve increased the number of NHS Talking Therapies sessions, we’re building new mental health emergency departments for those reaching crisis point, and we’ve now got mental health support in almost half the schools in UK, because prevention is better than cure. But there’s a lot more to do. And to get the prescription right, we first need to accurately diagnose what is causing the surge in mental ill health. That is how we will ensure that everyone gets the support they need, when they need it.

commentisfree_2025_dec_04_women-right-to-vote-disenfranchisement.txt,opinion,2025-12-04,Moira Donegan,Rightwingers are trying to destroy women’s right to vote,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/04/women-right-to-vote-disenfranchisement,"Sexism can be very modern and tech savvy. Misogyny is an ever-evolving idiom, and men and women alike have found particularly of-the-moment ways to operate within the genre. Think of the apps that take images of women and remove their clothes, or the AI bots that men and boys can use to generate pornography or depictions of graphic violence against women and girls for the crime of going to the same school as they do or running for office. Think of the influencers of the so-called “womanosphere” who tell their female audiences that women who seek out friendship or equality with men are morons or cows, all through the gleam of a TikTok filter. Sexism may be the world’s oldest prejudice and its first unjust hierarchy, but it is continually innovating, adapting to new technologies and the most recent rhetorical needs of male supremacy. But some of the forms of misogyny that have been bubbling up in American political discourse lately can seem a bit retro. I don’t just mean the tradwives, who dress alternately like June Cleaver or like Ma Ingalls from Little House on the Prairie – evoking bygone eras, or at least the ways those eras are depicted on television. And I don’t just mean the pro-natalists, either, who don weird bonnets and propose national breeding medals for prolific mothers. Since last month’s massive election victories for Democrats, some on the right have looked to revive a form of sexism that has been out of fashion for more than one hundred years: the idea that women should not have a right to vote. More and more, influential voices in the Maga movement and the far-right Republican party are calling to strip women of the franchise. It’s not that this is strictly a new development. Opposition to women’s voting rights has long been a fringe, but persistent, feature of the American right. It’s been a favorite hobby horse of extremist preachers; it trended among Trump supporters on social media in the lead-up to the 2016 election, when polls showed that Trump would win if only men voted. (As it happened, he won anyway.) In the century that followed the passage of the 19th amendment – which barred the United States or any state from restricting the vote on the basis of sex, and enfranchised hundreds of thousands of women when it was ratified in 1920 – opposition to women’s right to vote has simmered at the extreme edges of political opinion. It was kept alive in large part in ultra-conservative Christian communities, which tend to cast women as something between children and property. Claiming women to be intellectually and morally unfit for citizenship, these sects declared that women should withdraw from the public sphere, including from political participation, and submit to the rule of their husbands. Joel Webbon, a pastor and YouTube personality, has been at the forefront of this brand of misogynist Christian reaction. (Webbon claims not to be a misogynist but is rather a self-identified “sexist”; what he imagines the difference to be is not entirely clear.) In 2022, just before the nation’s first post-Dobbs midterm elections, he tweeted: “The 19th Amendment was a bad idea.” He is broadly opposed to women’s participation in the political realm, saying in an interview last year that “God has not designed women for warfare, and that’s part of what politics is – it’s really all that politics is, it’s war without the blood”. (That war is not politics would be news, I think, to those who have waged it, women among them.) Dale Partridge, also a pastor, justified his own opposition to women’s suffrage using a term of art that has become popular on the fringe right: “I think we should repeal the 19th Amendment because I love America and American women,” he said, “and want to protect our nation from their suicidal empathy.”(Emphasis mine.) Here, women are cast as supposedly naturally, inherently more empathetic than men are – and this, in turn, is undesirable, indeed suicidal. It is something of a back-handed compliment. Like the racist “great replacement” theory and other strains of white nationalism, the opposition to women’s suffrage has entered the mainstream as the Republican party has radicalized. In August, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, who has been accused of sexual assault, reposted a video in which pastors explain their opposition to women’s right to vote, with the caption “All of Christ for All of Life” – a Christian nationalist slogan. (Hegseth, who denied the allegation, reached a settlement with the alleged victim.) But in recent decades, a more secular brand of anti-suffrage feeling has also challenged women’s voting rights, this one emerging from the strains of the right invested in biological determinism – a set of commitments ranging from evolutionary psychology to eugenics. This worldview tends to cast women as inferior not due to divine mandate, but due to nature, which, it is claimed, has made them either too stupid or too irresponsible for the vote. Helen Andrews, a rightwing magazine editor whose recent piece The Great Feminization suggests women’s presence in public life may pose “a threat to civilization”, claims women have “evolved” toward several various and seemingly contradictory habits – too empathetic and consensus-based, on the one hand, and too gossipy, conniving and passive-aggressive, on the other. The logical conclusion to Andrews’s argument is that women should be immediately excluded from political life and from all major institutions; perhaps lacking the courage of her convictions, she does not argue women should be deprived of citizenship, instead proposing a shift of public life towards further male dominance – claiming, for instance, that “the rule of law will not survive the legal profession becoming majority female”. In describing women as an obstacle to conservative priorities, she echoes Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist, rightwing mega-donor and longtime mentor to JD Vance, who wrote in 2009 that his ideal libertarian world had been rendered politically unfeasible by “the extension of the franchise to women”. (He later seemed to contradict this, saying he did not “think any class should be disenfranchised”.) These two assertions – that women are ordained by God to be men’s inferiors, or that they have been designed by nature to be men’s inferiors – use pseudoscience, lies and heresy to conceal their plain sexist bigotry behind a thin veneer of patronizing condescension. They claim, implausibly – with the sneering tone of a cartoon villain baring his rotting teeth at a child hero – to be looking to strip women of their rights, freedoms and dignity for their own good. But they are now joined by a third strain of anti-suffrage sentiment: that of undisguised misogynist contempt. A growing number of rightwing influencers simply state that they feel that women should not vote because they hate women, and want women to be subjected to male domination. Andrew Tate, the men’s rights influencer and alleged human trafficker, posted in September to his X account: “Stop letting women vote, stop giving women position as judges, stop giving women political appointments … WOMEN: giving you political and social power is how we ended up here.” The opponents of women’s suffrage have, for now, no way of enacting their ambition: there is no path to repealing the 19th amendment. But they are part of a growing movement to blame women’s advancement – and their increased access, participation and visibility in education, the workforce, politics and public life – for a slew of social problems, from political polarization to economic stagnation to a vague sense of spiritual anomie. As Jessica Winter recently pointed out in the New Yorker, in a piece on the centrist pundits who have declared a crisis of men, this sentiment – that women’s citizenship and status should be lower, and that recognizing it has hurt the country – is peddled by thinkers and writers far more respectable than the likes of Webbon or Tate. “The [New York] Times pundit Ezra Klein has lately suggested that Democrats consider running anti-abortion candidates in red states, even though more than three-quarters of Gen Z women support abortion rights,” Winter writes. “Rights, like jobs, can be gender-coded, and these rights are valued accordingly.” This range of sexisms that have attained mainstream credibility in politics and the press rest on one assumption: that women’s citizenship is partial and conditional compared with men’s, that we have less of a claim on rights, dignity and public participation than our brothers do. That this assumption is even held is an insult to women’s dignity; that it is now so blithely accepted is a sign of how far women’s status has already sunk. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist"
commentisfree_2025_dec_05_agriculture-revolution-soil-farming-earth-rover-program.txt,opinion,2025-12-05,George Monbiot,"Over a pint in Oxford, we may have stumbled upon the holy grail of agriculture",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/05/agriculture-revolution-soil-farming-earth-rover-program,"It felt like walking up a mountain during a temperature inversion. You struggle through fog so dense you can scarcely see where you’re going. Suddenly, you break through the top of the cloud, and the world is laid out before you. It was that rare and remarkable thing: a eureka moment. For the past three years, I’d been struggling with a big and frustrating problem. In researching my book Regenesis, I’d been working closely with Iain Tolhurst (Tolly), a pioneering farmer who had pulled off something extraordinary. Almost everywhere, high-yield farming means major environmental harm, due to the amount of fertiliser, pesticides and (sometimes) irrigation water and deep ploughing required. Most farms with apparently small environmental impacts produce low yields. This, in reality, means high impacts, as more land is needed to produce a given amount of food. But Tolly has found the holy grail of agriculture: high and rising yields with minimal environmental harm. He uses no fertiliser, no animal manure and no pesticides. His techniques, the result of decades of experiment and observation, appear to enrich the crucial relationships between crops and microbes in the soil, through which soil nutrients must pass. It seems that Tolly has, in effect, “trained” his soil bacteria to release nutrients when his crops require them (a process called mineralisation), and lock them up when his crops aren’t growing (immobilisation), ensuring they don’t leach from the soil. So why the frustration? Well, Tolly has inspired many other growers to attempt the same techniques. Some have succeeded, with excellent results. Others have not. And no one can work out why. It’s likely to have something to do with soil properties. But what? Not for the first time, I had stumbled into a knowledge gap so wide that humanity could fall through it. Soil is a fantastically complex biological structure, like a coral reef, built and sustained by the creatures that inhabit it. It supplies 99% of our calories. Yet we know less about it than any other identified ecosystem. It’s almost a black box. Many brilliant scientists have devoted their lives to its study. But there are major barriers. Most soil properties cannot be seen without digging, and if you dig a hole, you damage the structures you’re trying to investigate. As a result, studying even basic properties is cumbersome, time-consuming and either very expensive or simply impossible at scale. To measure the volume of soil in a field, for example, you need to take hundreds of core samples. But as soil depths can vary greatly from one metre to the next, your figure relies on extrapolation. This makes it very hard to tell whether you’re losing soil or gaining it. Measuring bulk density (the amount of soil in a given volume, which shows how compacted it might be), or connected porosity (the tiny catacombs created by lifeforms, a crucial measure of soil health), or soil carbon – at scale – is even harder. So farmers must guess. Partly because they cannot see exactly what the soil needs, many of their inputs – fertilisers, irrigation, deep ploughing – are wasted. Roughly two-thirds of the nitrogen fertiliser they apply, and between 50% and 80% of their phosphorus, is lost. These lost minerals cause algal blooms in rivers, dead zones at sea, costs for water users and global heating. Huge amounts of irrigation water are also wasted. Farmers sometimes “subsoil” their fields – ploughing that is deep and damaging – because they suspect compaction. The suspicion is often wrong. Our lack of knowledge also inhibits the development of a new agriculture, which may, as Tolly has done, allow farmers to replace chemical augmentation with biological enhancement. So when I came to write the book, I made a statement so vague that it reads like an admission of defeat: we needed to spend heavily on “an advanced science of the soil”, and use it to deliver a “greener revolution”. While we know almost nothing about the surface of our own planet, billions are spent on the Mars Rover programme, exploring the barren regolith there. What we needed, I argued, is an Earth Rover programme, mapping the world’s agricultural soils at much finer resolution. I might as well have written “something must be done!” The necessary technologies simply did not exist. I sank into a stygian gloom. * * * At the same time, Tarje Nissen-Meyer, then a professor of geophysics at the University of Oxford, was grappling with a different challenge. Seismology is the study of waves passing through a solid medium. Thanks to billions from the oil and gas industry, it has become highly sophisticated. Tarje wanted to use this powerful tool for the opposite purpose – ecological improvement. Already, with colleagues, he had deployed seismology to study elephant behaviour in Kenya. Not only was it highly effective, but his team also discovered it could identify animal species walking through the savannah by their signature footfall. By luck we were both attached, in different ways, to Wolfson College, Oxford, where we met in February 2022. I saw immediately that he was a thoughtful man – a visionary. I suggested a pint in The Magdalen Arms. I explained my problem, and we talked about the limits of existing technologies. Was seismology being used to study soil, I asked. He’d never heard of it. “I guess it’s not a suitable technology then?” No, he told me, “soil should be a good medium for seismology. In fact, we need to filter out the soil noise when we look at the rocks.” “So if it’s noise, it could be signal?” “Definitely.” We stared at each other. Time seemed to stall. Could this really be true? Over the next three days, Tarje conducted a literature search. Nothing came up. I wrote to Prof Simon Jeffery, an eminent soil scientist at Harper Adams University, whose advice I’d found invaluable when researching the book. I set up a Zoom call. He would surely explain that we were barking up the wrong tree. Simon is usually a reserved man. But when he had finished questioning Tarje, he became quite animated. “All my life I’ve wanted to ‘see’ into the soil,” he said. “Maybe now we can.” I was introduced to a brilliant operations specialist, Katie Bradford, who helped us build an organisation. We set up a non-profit called the Earth Rover Program, to develop what we call “soilsmology”; to build open-source hardware and software cheap enough to be of use to farmers everywhere; and to create, with farmers, a global, self-improving database. This, we hope, might one day incorporate every soil ecosystem: a kind of Human Genome Project for the soil. We later found that some scientists had in fact sought to apply seismology to soil, but it had not been developed into a programme, partly because the approaches used were not easily scalable. My role was mostly fixer, finding money and other help. We received $4m (£3m) in start-up money from the Bezos Earth Fund. This may cause some discomfort, but our experience has been entirely positive: the fund has helped us do exactly what we want. We also got a lot of pro-bono help from the law firm Hogan Lovells. Tarje, now at the University of Exeter, and Simon began assembling their teams. They would need to develop an ultra-high-frequency variant of seismology. A big obstacle was cost. In 2022, suitable sensors cost $10,000 (£7,500) apiece. They managed to repurpose other kit: Tarje found that a geophone developed by a Slovakian experimental music outfit worked just as well, and cost only $100. Now one of our scientists, Jiayao Meng, is developing a sensor for about $10. In time, we should be able to use the accelerometers in mobile phones, reducing the cost to zero. As for generating seismic waves, we get all the signal we need by hitting a small metal plate with a welder’s hammer. On its first deployment, our team measured the volume of a peat bog that had been studied by scientists for 50 years. After 45 minutes in the field, they produced a preliminary estimate suggesting that previous measurements were out by 20%. Instead of extrapolating the peat depth from point samples, they could see the wavy line where the peat met the subsoil. The implications for estimating carbon stocks are enormous. We’ve also been able to measure bulk density at a very fine scale; to track soil moisture (as part of a wider team); to start building the AI and machine learning tools we need; and to see the varying impacts of different agricultural crops and treatments. Next we’ll work on measuring connected porosity, soil texture and soil carbon; scaling up to the hectare level and beyond; and on testing the use of phones as seismometers. We now have further funding, from the UBS Optimus Foundation, hubs on three continents and a big international team. Eventually, we hope, any farmer anywhere, rich or poor, will be able to get an almost instant readout from their soil. As more people use the tools, building the global database, we hope these readouts will translate into immediate useful advice. The tools should also revolutionise soil protection: the EU has issued a soil-monitoring law, but how can it be implemented? Farmers are paid for their contributions “to improve soil health and soil resilience”, but what this means in practice is ticking a box on a subsidy form: there’s no sensible way of checking. We’re not replacing the great work of other soil scientists but, developing our methods alongside theirs, we believe we can fill part of the massive knowledge gap. As one of the farmers we’re working with, Roddy Hall, remarks, the Earth Rover Program could “take the guesswork out of farming”. One day it might help everyone arrive at that happy point: high yields with low impacts. Seismology promises to shake things up. George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

There were drinks, there were meals, there were balloons, there was singing. They were celebrating me. Since then, his birthdays have become about him and his friends and the quality of the event has spiralled precipitously. These days, with two kids out in society, kids’ birthday parties dominate our family’s schedule. Barely a weekend goes by without a scramble to find a gift that’s appropriate, I’m getting increasingly desperate for some form of wrapping apparatus, and I have long given up on cards. When we arrive at a party, the gorging begins. I consider myself on the chill end of the spectrum yet even I can feel the teeth deterioration from across the room. The only thing worse than this is a “sugar-free” event, which should be a reportable offence. The most gastronomically memorable kid’s party I attended had a coffee cart for the parents. I’ll probably never know a joy like that for the rest of my days. Birthday parties allow me to observe my kids’ interactions with other kids – like David Attenborough with a wide-angle lens. A sort of mania takes over until they exhaust themselves and agree to be carted away. What chance do they have when they’re surrounded by self-conscious, tired parents making conversation with all the ease of undergoing a pap smear? How are the little ones supposed to learn social graces when their role models are trying to make small talk with parents they don’t know from a bar of soap and who screech “Oi!” mid-sentence to break up a dispute or get their kids out of a tree? There is a promised land, where the kids can be deposited at a party and I can spend the time quietly meditating or scrolling my phone. I have not yet arrived there but other parents tell me it exists, and it sounds akin to paradise. My kids’ demands when it comes to their own parties have become louder. The days of a sheet-pan brownie with a single candle in it are no longer acceptable. Now a theme must be adhered to, their interests reflected, their wishes regarding the guest list and (infinite) balloon quantity heard. And now the other kids talk back. They ask questions. They have requests. They seem to miss that a couple of years ago I actually grew a human being from my flesh and, despite not being built for it whatsoever, successfully delivered this human being into this realm. I get very little credit for this at these events. Pointing this out is not well received by five-year-olds. Instead the kids tear around, create an 80-decibel environment and have elaborate beefs that flare up and dissolve in an instant. They ignore that they are coeliac, invent new games, inevitably leave someone out, try to blow out the candles. Sometimes they even provide feedback – imagine! I do my bit: blowing up balloons until I’m dizzy, putting out a sugar-rich spread, frantically cleaning, worrying nobody will come, freaking out when they do. I have 300 attempts at a conversation, none of which go beyond a few sentences. Despite my inability to gracefully host a few sweet kids and adults, the fact that my kids have lived another year is a triumph. They grow, they change, they stay the same, they ask perplexing questions, they go to school, they have parts of their lives that I am not a part of. It’s scary and it should be celebrated. As society becomes increasingly weird – moderated through our phones and where we often don’t know our neighbours – kids’ parties can be part of the cure. They build real-world relationships and our kids’ friends at these ages could be part of our lives for ever. Every connection is a new or potential friend in our area. What could be more social than celebrating life’s mundane milestones? After all, the worst part of a party is not being invited."
commentisfree_2025_dec_05_great-european-bake-off-eu-closer-integration-pop-culture.txt,opinion,2025-12-05,Paula Erizanu,"The Great European Bake-Off: if the EU wants closer integration, how about using pop culture?",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/05/great-european-bake-off-eu-closer-integration-pop-culture,"It was both enjoyable and strange to see the EU enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, present the news on Moldovan TV a couple of months ago. For one thing, she is Slovenian – and she is also a diplomat, not a news anchor. But there she was, announcing that Moldova had made more progress in the last three years than it had in the previous 30, and that negotiations for our country to join the European Union would open soon. It was equally surprising to spot Kos in the Instagram stories of leading Moldovan influencer siblings Emilian and Nina Crețu at the end of August – she had invited them to her house in Brussels for a Moldovan pie-making workshop. Kos even brought together the two heads of Moldova’s biggest Orthodox churches for a meeting, in spite of their mutual animosity. This is not the way we are used to EU officials communicating. The departure from stiff, technocratic speeches is part of EU efforts to involve civil society and the public in the EU’s next enlargement process – a difference from the last phase of expansion, from 2004 to 2013, where only the political elites were involved. If the EU is to create a more harmonious kind of European integration, it needs to meet its citizens on the terrain of everyday life like this. In candidate countries such as Albania, Montenegro and Moldova, EU membership feels like a lifeline. But becoming a member is also an arduous, technical process full of reports and negotiation clusters – it is not easy to make it sexy. In the western Balkans, the process has already been going on for years. At the first meeting of a new EU Enlargement Forum in Brussels in November, the Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, observed that he had been talking about EU accession for so long that he could track the process in the anatomy of his receding hairline. More than 90% of Albanians are keen to join the EU, while in Moldova the figure has varied between 53% and 65% throughout the years. For the majority of Moldovans, EU integration promises peace, prosperity, the rule of law and hope that their children could have a better future. The fears of EU-sceptic Moldovans, rooted in unease about the unknown, are boosted by Russian propaganda saying that EU membership means the loss of tradition, identity and sovereignty, or that local companies will not be able to compete against European giants. One other Kremlin-coined narrative is that the EU is about to collapse, just as the USSR did in 1991, or that the EU simply does not want to integrate Moldova. Why would it need a country of 2.4 million people? In the EU itself, enlargement is probably not especially on the minds of ordinary citizens. Overall, 56% of people within the EU said they believe their country would benefit from further enlargement. Tellingly, the same Eurobarometer survey found about two-thirds of EU citizens said they did not feel well informed about the process. Among their concerns, migration was at the top. With an ageing population, the EU continues to need more migrant workers: a labour force often drawn from poorer EU members or candidate states. If we are going to create a more perfect union, we cannot see these people as mere economic units, just human resources to be exploited. If the EU wants the free movement of people to lead to genuine cultural exchanges and human connections, and to stronger European identity and solidarity, it must ensure workers have help to learn the language of their host countries. It is hard to feel fully comfortable living in a country where you don’t speak the language. One theory about the Romanian diaspora’s drift to the far right attributes it to their cultural isolation in their new homes – where social lives exist only through smartphones and sometimes in local Romanian churches. Instead of leaving integration to the labour market and the individual, the EU should encourage people changing countries to take on language classes, perhaps through their employers. One thing more Europeans should do, in the season of Christmas parties, is to invite cleaners, security staff and everyone else working in our offices who may feel invisible to celebrate together, to have a drink and ask them about their lives. These people are usually left out, they are often from other countries, and a small gesture like this can make them feel so much more respected and welcome. Beyond the better integration of migrant workers, if the EU wants to create a stronger and more inclusive European identity, it needs to learn from and compete with Russia’s use of soft power through the entertainment industry. Russian comedy shows like KVN (in which the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy once starred), or the weekly figure-skating programme Ice Age, have been hugely popular – not just in Russia, but across the former Soviet world. Major events like Eurovision and the Champions League may bring Europeans together, but it should not end there. We need more blockbuster shows: what about Europe’s Got Talent, The Voice of Europe, European Top Gear, or The Great European Bake-Off? Why can’t these be broadcast in every EU member and candidate state? If the EU truly wants to get its citizens more involved in processes that once only concerned governments, it needs to drop its dry bureaucratic culture and create more genuine bridges between us – through language, through storytelling, and through the unifying power of culture.

Cash or conspiracy will find it out and it will leak. Already, the consultation is a lie. Facial surveillance is already up and running. London’s Met police claims it has caught more than 100 sex offenders breaking their licence conditions. At least six forces have their town centres plugged in and Whitehall has admitted that it intends the technology to be used nationwide. The policing minister, Sarah Jones, calls facial surveillance “the biggest breakthrough for catching criminals since DNA matching”. It will “help free up police time”. What’s not to like? Every year sees a new advance of state and corporate intrusion into individual privacy. It does not always succeed. In 2013, the government tried to introduce a nationalised NHS data system that amassed all local GP records of personal health. This, it intended, would help supply A&amp;E departments with possibly life-saving information, and aid research. The data would be surrounded with safeguards against abuse. The collected material would be ostensibly anonymised and sold to industry to help cover costs. A sceptical public felt the safeguards were not to be trusted. Sooner or later every insurance company in the land would know from personal data how much to charge for insurance. Every employer would know whom not to hire. Since the scheme was voluntary, over a million opted out. The project collapsed three years later. At much the same time, the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden’s revelations of internet surveillance by American and British intelligence services broke cover. Two lessons followed. One was that the services regard any behaviour on their part, however outrageous, as valid for reasons of “national security”. The other was that no computer data was truly safe. With American and British services sharing material hacked from personal archives, safeguards could be ignored and lied about. America was the land of the free, including a government wishing to do what it liked with anyone’s secrets. The result of a digital free-for-all was satirised in Dave Eggers’ novel The Circle. First many politicians, and then citizens, were encouraged to carry a body camera that recorded and transmitted in real time where they were and what they were doing. It was said to promote political accountability and personal integrity. You could refuse, but those who refused could be identified and hounded down. Even Eggers did not envisage a state in which every human face seen in public could be instantly identified. Computers can then match it against a national “hitlist” of individuals who have, at some point, crossed the behavioural line, and trace and record their movements. It would be similar to the data that enables banks to rule out, as a suitable customer, anyone who defaults on a payment or steps out of line. Of course we can see the benefits of facial recognition. In potential hotspots there may be a case for some version of it. Intruding on privacy always sings the best tunes. Surveillance could apparently replace a probation tag. Police forces report that live facial recognition has led to over 1,000 arrests for offences including rape and burglary. It has captured an illegal immigrant; the Home Office says it can be used to find missing children. Jones says it also creates a “hostile environment for prolific sexual offenders”. Who can object when the innocent have nothing to fear? This has long been the slogan of state power. During the controversy over the NHS database, I shall not forget the cackle of laughter from a computer expert when I asked him about Whitehall’s safeguards. “If there is one thing we know,” he said, “it is that no modern safeguard can beat the modern hacker.” As for when the safeguarder – the state – is also the hacker, there is no stopping it. During the Snowden revelations, the NSA was using the Prism system to gain illicit access to Google, Apple, Microsoft and Yahoo, and even inducing Microsoft to circumvent its own encryption. We already know what internet companies can do with evidence of our needs and preferences, scraped from our emails. They use it to make money. Ten years ago, we refused to allow our NHS details to be collated by Whitehall in the knowledge that they would inevitably leak. For the same reason we should deny permission for the state to track and record our private lives. I doubt if the state will listen. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_dec_05_labour-plan-child-poverty-government-strategy-britain.txt,opinion,2025-12-05,Polly Toynbee,"Labour has a groundbreaking plan for child poverty. Finally, this government has found its mission",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/05/labour-plan-child-poverty-government-strategy-britain,"Once Labour set up a child poverty taskforce, it was predestined that the two-child benefit limit would be abolished. Every authority consulted confirmed it as the fastest way to rescue the most children from a life of direst poverty. Every authority, that is, except the general public, who oppose removing the cap by 56% to 31%, YouGov finds. This was an unpopular act knowingly taken for good reasons. Not many will read the taskforce’s findings, but if they did, even the meanest mind might soften: the dismal facts of a child’s life in poverty are, as ever, shocking. All the many measures in this far-reaching policy will lift 550,000 children above the poverty line by 2030 – the most achieved within one parliament. But that leaves behind about 4 million poor children living without the basics. That still makes us among the most unequal and most poverty-stricken of similar European countries. This is a major factor in why British five-year-olds have now become up to 7cms shorter than children of the same age in Europe. Streams of reports emerge from thinktanks and charities describing the plight of desperate people. It’s a story so familiar that it’s easy to be numbed into accepting that a third of the children around us are poor, often without adequate food or heating, many without a home, with no internet connection for homework and no joining in what classmates take for granted: “my holiday”. Labour governments don’t hide these brutish facts of British life. The government’s new strategy lays bare our social disgrace in painful detail, promising annual updates on all the causes, effects and remedies. In 1999, Tony Blair stunned experts with his promise to eliminate child poverty within 20 years: by the halfway mark in 2010 good progress had been made, but the country was not quite there. There’s never time to get enough done, before the right takes over to reverse and vandalise everything. Think of the 3,500 Sure Starts mostly closed or left without the people and services to provide families with the support that changed lives. One of the lucky survivors, a model to remember, is the Jubilee children’s centre in Brixton, south London: beautiful, spacious and purpose-built with every kind of children’s activity and support for adults. On Thursday, parents were in a sewing-machine class, while outside a food bus project was selling fruit and veg at low cost as it travelled round local estates. Two of the ministers, Liz Kendall and Alison McGovern, who together with Bridget Phillipson were lead authors of the strategy chose this location to share their findings, promoting a long list of initiatives across departments from health to housing and transport: getting children out of squalid temporary accommodation that is several bus journeys away from their school is a key promise. Strings of policies designed to root out disadvantage count the ways poor children “do less well in school, are more likely to be unemployed when older and earn less throughout their lifetimes”. Billed as a decade-long strategy, this “is just the first step on our journey to drive down child poverty”, it says. Will Labour get the time? For the contrast between right and left governments, just look at child poverty graphs to know who was in power when. George Osborne’s savage benefit cuts, mostly targeted at families, came with toxic messages pitting the strivers against the skivers, the family sleeping behind the blinds in the morning while next door leave for work. His poison was taken up by programmes such as Benefits Street, which selected choice feckless cases to pillory as examples of everyone on social security. The message accompanying the new strategy is emphatic: almost three-quarters of children in poverty now come from working families. Jobs don’t guarantee escape from poverty – a word the Tories never used, preferring the description “low-income”. On it goes, with Kemi Badenoch labelling this “a budget for Benefits Street” 10 years after the programme ended, stirring up moral panic without admitting that total benefit costs are not spiralling: non-pensioner benefits have stayed at 4-5% of GDP for the past 40 years. Are we by nature nastier? Belief that the criteria needed to qualify for benefits aren’t strict enough has grown in the past few years, says Patrick English of YouGov. Gideon Skinner of Ipsos tells me that younger people in Britain are the most generous, with 18- to 24-year-olds most in favour of abolishing the two-child cap and older people most strongly against. Asked what spending should be cut, voters put welfare top. Never underestimate the life-long foghorn influence of the rightwing media both on- and offline. Here are the Sun’s responses to the budget: “Jobless mums hail Reeves’ ‘Benefits Street’ budget as ‘dream come true’ and vow to cash-in by having more kids”; “Families will foot handout bill for skivers”; “Labour is layabouts party”. Arguing against that is an uphill task. The Blair government ducked persuasion, doing good by stealth instead, rebadging benefits as “working tax credits” to sound better. Successful back-to-work programmes for young people emphasised stick not carrot in public, though kindly, well-attuned help was what worked, not threats. “You have to make the case about poverty time and again, for every generation,” Kendall says, recalling what it took for Harriet Harman to steer the Blair-Brown government towards nurseries. She quotes the theme of the strategy’s foreword: beyond pity for lives wasted, it warns of “the cost of inaction that our economy – and future generations – cannot afford … in poorer health, worse educational attainment, lower skills and lower earnings”. It was a sadness to see one of the remaining Sure Start centres; a reminder of what might have been everywhere by now. This government is rolling out new Best Start hubs, aiming for one in every council area in England by 2028. Pressing on means making children every department’s priority. It helps that Phillipson and Wes Streeting themselves come from poor backgrounds, in the most working-class cabinet ever, which is likely to prevent this child poverty strategy from becoming a one-day policy. A government lacking a coherent theme would do well to make children the focus and the purpose of everything from now on. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_dec_05_labour-supporters-child-poverty-honest-about-brexit.txt,opinion,2025-12-05,Gaby Hinsliff,Give credit where it’s due: Labour is finally doing things its supporters actually want,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/05/labour-supporters-child-poverty-honest-about-brexit,"What does it take for a small child not to recognise their own name? I’ve been thinking about that for days, since reading the Local Government Association’s recent report on a growing crisis in early childhood. We’ve known for a while about children starting school still in nappies, or speaking in Americanisms absorbed from hours stuck in front of YouTube, or even struggling to sit upright because they’ve spent too long slumped over an iPad to develop core muscles. So sadly, it’s not surprising to read of early-years workers telling the LGA they see more and more pre-schoolers who can barely speak, play with others or contain their rage when things don’t go their way. But it was the practitioner who noted that some children “don’t seem to respond to their name” who got to me. You have to wonder how often that child hears a loving adult trying to get their attention. Too often, another practitioner said, “children are not spoken to at home, but offered screens all day” – at mealtimes, out shopping, or in the car – with parents seemingly scared of provoking tantrums if they take the phone away. The report describes a complex puzzle with multiple causes: poverty, and the parental exhaustion that comes of a hardscrabble life; growing up in a pandemic; changes in early-years provision; and way too much screen time. It can’t be solved by money alone, but certainly won’t be solved without it. So a two-pronged strategy of lifting the two-child limit on children’s welfare payments – as Rachel Reeves did last week – and intervening early where toddlers aren’t meeting their milestones makes sense. The Best Start family hubs rolling out gradually nationwide will, we learned this week, get Send (special educational needs and disabilities) co-ordinators, focusing particularly on speech and language. They’ll promote the upcoming National Year of Reading to wean kids off screens and on to books, and more generally attempt, on a shoestring, to mimic the support that their predecessor programme Sure Start once offered parents. There’s not enough funding – there never is – but there are the beginnings of joined-up thinking, accepting that tackling problems in nursery rather than in primary school is easier, cheaper and kinder on everyone involved. Let’s not tempt fate, given this government’s unparalleled ability to take one step forward and three back. But for the record: taxing the better-off in the budget to invest in tackling child poverty, telling some home truths about the economic damage done by Brexit (as Keir Starmer also did this week), and striking a zero-tariff deal on pharmaceuticals with Donald Trump to save a lot of jobs isn’t a terrible week at the office. More surprisingly, for the first time in ages Labour is talking about things its supporters actually like. Jobs! Europe! Children not going hungry! Evidently there has been a disturbance in the force. Westminster rumour has it that the Morgan McSweeney tendency inside government – focused on wining voters back from Reform – is currently being out-argued by those more worried about losing them to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Who knows whether this will last, or what this will do to their electoral fortunes, so for once let’s stay focused on those at the sharp end. The biggest budget winners in terms of net income, the Resolution Foundation thinktank notes, were the poorest 10%; the biggest losers were the richest 10%. Strip away all the fuss about who leaked what to whom, and there’s the gist: Reeves raised money mostly from the better off and spent it mostly on poorer families. She got there inelegantly but she got there, and now there will be children waking up tomorrow who won’t suffer the lifelong harms of early deprivation. At the time of writing, the government’s imminent child poverty strategy is still under wraps, but children’s charities were unanimous that it would be pointless without scrapping the two-child limit. That’s done. What remains is to tell a compelling human story about how children’s lives will change as a result of all that public money, to make people feel it’s worth it. Of course Nigel Farage will say Labour is whacking up taxes for no good reason. But he backed the lifting of the cap this summer, and Reform has problems of its own. For all its meteoric rise in the polls, it has struggled to break the 30% ceiling – a nice problem to have, admittedly, when you’re still miles ahead of the two supposedly big parties, but 30% isn’t enough to win an election. Hence renewed speculation that Reform will merge with the Tories, which would indeed make sense electorally – if only so many of those involved didn’t hate each other. Meanwhile both Labour and Tory strategists have noticed that Reform’s vote share seemingly falls a bit when the economy is uppermost in people’s thoughts, and rises when immigration is. When the battle is over tax and how to spend it, or where new jobs are coming from, Reform isn’t clear what it wants to say and so loses ground to the Tories. The striking thing about watching Kemi Badenoch pummel Rachel Reeves in parliament last week was how it left Farage oddly out in the cold. Let’s not get carried away here. The chancellor’s path remains strewn with landmines – including a revolt brewing among rural Labour MPs over the increasingly toxic farm inheritance tax – and this administration’s capacity for self-destruction is prodigious. But when a Labour government actually delivers some of what its supporters were screaming for, it’s churlish not to acknowledge it. Sometimes, you just have to take yes for an answer.

commentisfree_2025_dec_05_liz-truss-show-former-pm-youtube-talkshow.txt,opinion,2025-12-05,Marina Hyde,The Liz Truss Show will confront the big issues of the day. For example: who on earth would watch Liz Truss?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/05/liz-truss-show-former-pm-youtube-talkshow,"Will you be seeing a pantomime this year? Birmingham’s got Gok Wan and Biggins in Robin Hood, Bradford has Sinitta in Snow White, while Bromley landed Su Pollard for Beauty and the Beast. And at the end of YouTube’s infinite pier, there’s The Liz Truss Show, starring She’s-Behind-You herself. Curtain up on that one is tonight at 6pm. According to the producers, Liz’s show “confronts the issues that others tiptoe around”. Wow. The lives, loves, and clinical explanations? Let’s just say I’d watch that. Sadly, this doesn’t seem to be the format. Instead, like all seasonal entertainment, The Liz Truss Show is based on a fairytale. “The deep state and their allies in the media and politics tried to destroy me,” madam explains in a statement, “now I’m back.” Are the gilt markets the deep state now? Honestly, I can’t keep up. You’ll remember that the irony of Truss’s flameout at the hands of market forces was particularly acute given that she had spent an entire career explaining that free markets were the greatest judge of absolutely everything. Small ideological adjustment: free markets are now the greatest judge of everything except the ideas and personage of Liz Truss. Anyhow, Liz says her new show, also available on other platforms such as Spotify, X and Substack, is for people who are “tired of experts who get everything wrong, elites who refuse to listen, and weak leaders”. Amazing. Liz famously ticked each of those three boxes, yet somehow regards herself as the antidote. It’s a sort of political homeopathy, I guess, where a very small amount of the thing is also the cure for the thing. Furthermore, it confirms the notion that the modern political wilderness truly is a wilderness, in that absolutely no one even goes there any more, let alone stays there. Primarily, our host says, this new punditry and debate show is about “the cultural battles reshaping the west”. Like me, many of you will feel you missed the meeting where Liz Truss was elected as the standard-bearer of “the west”. Yet it seems to have become the most inescapable element of her post-premiership LinkedIn profile. Her flop book was entitled Ten Years to Save the West, which is arguably not route one to appealing to a book-buying public whose mortgages you’ve just hiked. If Liz were capable of saving any west, you’d have thought South West Norfolk would have been a start, but the voters there had other ideas, overturning her 26,000 majority in the general election last year. (Incidentally, the save-the-west book was subtitled: Lessons From the Only Conservative in the Room. Which is one way of spinning the fact that you’re the only person in the room, because everyone else suddenly remembered they need to talk to someone in the kitchen.) The new show tries once again for a new start, with Truss tweaking the origin story quite spellbindingly. Try to imagine the Family Fortunes researchers going down any British high street, asking 100 people, “Why did Liz Truss get ditched as PM?” and getting the following answer from even one of them: “I was deposed as prime minister for trying to save Britain from the doomloop we are in.” Picture the host with his arm around Truss, wincing comically at the board and saying: “If it’s up there, I’ll give you the money myself.” Speaking of giving money to Liz, we must move on, because – amazingly – this new media venture is not even my favourite Truss announcement of the past fortnight. That honour has to go to the unveiling of a new private London club, spearheaded by Liz, who wants members to give her – are you ready for this? – £500,000 each to join. I know! But it’s true! She’s recorded a personal invitation video message and everything, in which she seeks recruits for a new kind of private members’ club. So, no shit coke or proud dad sexual harassers claiming to be film producers? Truly, end of a very long era. But apparently, this is one for “pro-growth leaders”, which is certainly something you can imagine being droned in your ear at 2am by an experiential marketing agency boss who’s missed the last train to Beaconsfield. Sorry, where was I? Oh yes, it’s called The Leconfield, and I think you can officially regard the search for the most cursed private members’ club in Mayfair as over. What seems to be being offered is a shared office, or as Liz would have it, “a secure ecosystem” and “unique business centre” for people “at the forefront of technology, policy, and capital”. I want to call it “a WeWork for arseholes” but I think that’s just a WeWork. But with something this much of a joke, what a miss not to call it HoHo House. Instead, black lacquer boxes have arrived at the offices of solicited members. These contained the personal message from Truss and the information that she was seeking to sign up no fewer than 700 people at that price point. “Join me,” she coaxed, “as we build this new reality of collaboration, innovation and prosperity together.” Join her? JOIN HER? Now that I’ve perused the introductory offer – and, indeed, now that I know about The Liz Truss Show – I am struck by the fact that there is in fact a certain coherence to these two seemingly absurdist projects. If, after everything, Liz Truss genuinely is able to find 700 people to pay her half a million quid, then fine – I will agree with her. Because how could you not? How could you draw anything other than the conclusion that not just this country, but the entire west, has actually fallen? Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_dec_05_reform-uk-bad-word-whatsapp-scrutiny.txt,opinion,2025-12-05,Will Hayward,I don’t care if Reform calls me a bad word on WhatsApp. But the story behind its gaffe is far more worrying,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/05/reform-uk-bad-word-whatsapp-scrutiny,"Last week saw one of the proudest moments of my journalism career. Leaked messages from a WhatsApp group containing several senior members of Reform UK in Wales seemed to suggest that the party’s director of communications called me a bad word in January this year. I won’t say the word, but it’s the bad one beginning with C. Personally I don’t have any issue with being called that inside a private group. I would have considered it a stain on my professionalism if any political party’s comms chief had given me a glowing review. Mates of mine have actually suggested that it’s perhaps the most accurate thing to come out of Reform UK HQ. However, it is symbolic of behaviour from Reform in Wales that makes me far more concerned about what the party would be like in power, and which should worry voters both here in Cymru and in the wider UK. The first concern has to be its attitude to scrutiny. The message thread in which Reform treated me with such warmth was discussing a social media post where I’d suggested that the fact the party hasn’t named a Welsh leader was disrespectful to Wales. I had posted: “They are telling the people of Wales: ‘Vote for us, but if you do, you’ll only find out who your first minister will be after we win.’” Former Conservative MP Mark Reckless posted in the chat:“My inclination would be to ignore it.” This has been Reform’s attitude to Wales ever since it put the Senedd in its crosshairs – it offers almost nothing specific to Wales, and having no Welsh leader it therefore avoids the scrutiny that comes with the position. Last year I went to Reform UK’s Wales conference in Newport. Nothing sums up its attitude to a free and independent media like this bizarre experience. First I was denied an interview with Nigel Farage because I was a Guardian columnist. When I explained that the vast majority of my work was as an independent reporter scrutinising the decisions made by the Welsh Labour government, party officials relented and granted me “two minutes” with the chief. By contrast, they gave 15 minutes to GB News, whose interviewer still only found time to ask one question about Wales. Just before my encounter began, one of Farage’s righthand men came up to me and said: “I have never worked with you before, and it will depend on how this goes whether I ever work with you again.” The message seemed clear to me: if you ask hard questions, you won’t get access. I can see why this threat may have worked in the past. Farage is a huge driver of newspaper sales and online clicks, so denying a journalist access to him is a powerful stick. It’s not hard to extrapolate what it would be like if the party were ever to get its hands on the levers of state. Much like in Trump’s US, access would be predicated on support for the regime. We have already seen this in Reform-run councils such as Nottinghamshire, which banned the local paper over a disagreement about a story it ran on local government reorganisation. It meant that none of the paper’s journalists or those covering the council for the BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporting Service were able to attend council events or interview councillors, as well as being taken off distribution lists for press releases. The ban was only lifted in October, after more than a month, following a legal challenge from the paper. That will be the party’s famous love of free speech in action. In Kent, another council the party controls, it was revealed last month that Reform planned to drastically cut the number of committees scrutinising its work. Another lesson the rest of the UK can take about Reform’s actions in Wales is that its members are really bad at turning up for the jobs they claim to want. The party only had one Senedd member, Laura Anne Jones, who defected from the Tories. She was labelled a “part-timer” after declining a place on a Senedd committee, making her the only MS who isn’t a member of any of the parliament’s 16 committees. One councillor recently elected in the Vale of Glamorgan is named Brandon Dodd. He won a byelection in September on the basis of being “a real local voice on the Vale council” who would “speak up” for local residents. In the first two council meetings held there since he was elected, the “local voice” failed to speak. He didn’t show up for the third one this week, when a key vote affecting a development in his ward was happening. In that WhatsApp group is encapsulated perhaps the most defining trait of Reform – and its precursor, Ukip – in Wales: bitter infighting. Of the seven Ukip candidates elected to the Senedd in 2016, only one of them was still a member by the end of the five-year term because of internal disagreements. One of them, Gareth Bennett, defected and became the first ever Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party MS (though not before he claimed £10,000 on an office that never opened). We can already see the cracks forming within Reform UK in Wales. The very fact that someone within the inner circle was willing to leak internal messages, just to do over a rival, shows that the tension is there even before the Welsh elections next May. Back in summer, in the space of six weeks, seven of the 15 Reform branch heads were removed. Three of these were women, meaning that there is only one woman in any position of power left within the Welsh party. If you want to understand a party, look at its actions and not its words. What we have in Wales is a chaotic party whose dislike of scrutiny seems only to be surpassed by its members’ dislike of each other. All credible politicians know that the freedom of the media to hold them to account is vital to a functioning democracy. If Reform UK is trying to hinder that media, you have to ask why.

But these are the latest takes on Dickens’s much-adapted classic: Christmas Karma from Gurinder Chadha, the Bend It Like Beckham director, brings us Mr Sood, a Ugandan Asian refugee (played by Kunal Nayyar), who came to Britain in 1972; Ebony Scrooge transforms the old miser into a Dominican fashion diva at the recently opened Sadler’s Wells East, London. We may think of Scrooge McDuck and the Muppets, but there was deep moral seriousness behind A Christmas Carol. Dickens had intended to write a political pamphlet entitled An Appeal on Behalf of the Poor Man’s Child, but instead decided to bury “the ghost of an idea” in a festive story. A Christmas Carol was written in six weeks and published on 19 December 1843, when Dickens was just 31. By Christmas Eve it had sold all 6,000 copies. By February 1844 there had been eight stage adaptations. Now this 182-year-old novel is being retold as 21st-century migrant stories. It is not hard to see why: Scrooge’s Malthusian fears about “surplus population” and the Victorian belief that the poor should be punished are echoed in today’s anti-immigration rhetoric. This Christmas has also brought the latest incarnation of the UK’s favourite furry asylum seeker – Paddington. The new musical knowingly updates Michael Bond’s 1958 original, inspired by child evacuees during the second world war. Here is multicultural London – albeit a wholesome Mary Poppins version with a carnival vibe, rather than the harsh reality experienced by most immigrants. A Peruvian bear who loves a cuppa, Paddington is unfailingly polite and eager to fit in. Embodying liberal and traditional values, he appeals to both sides of the culture wars. Only Paddington could have been invited to tea with the late Queen to celebrate the Platinum jubilee. It is tempting to be cynical about such reboots, messing around with national treasures and promoting a tourist vision of London. Do we need a breakdancing Bob Cratchit or a performing Paddington? Chadha has defended her right to take on a classic in Christmas Karma. “We all did Dickens at school. We must find ways to own art and tell stories from our unique perspective,” she told Radio 4. Updating these stories keeps them alive. The spirit of Dickens endures, and not just in adaptations. Former children’s laureate Michael Rosen and illustrator Helen Oxenbury (the duo behind We’re Going on a Bear Hunt) have created a Christmas short story, Pax, about a modern family struggling to make ends meet. It is to be published in the Big Issue. With record levels of child poverty in the UK, rising homelessness, extreme inequality and hostility towards immigrants, Christmas isn’t looking cheery for many. Theirs are the stories we need to hear. As the Ghost of Christmas Present is fading in Dickens’s novel, Scrooge spies two wretched children huddled in the spirit’s robe – a boy and a girl, Ignorance and Want. If society doesn’t look after its children (from darkest Peru or anywhere else) we cannot expect a better future. In our secular, consumerist times, A Christmas Carol and Paddington deliver messages of tolerance and compassion, as well as the possibility of redemption and change, delightfully wrapped up in heartwarming stories. No wonder we keep coming back for more."
commentisfree_2025_dec_05_the-guardian-view-on-reducing-child-poverty-with-the-two-child-limit-gone-labour-must-go-further.txt,opinion,2025-12-05,Editorial,"The Guardian view on reducing child poverty: with the two-child limit gone, Labour must go further",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/05/the-guardian-view-on-reducing-child-poverty-with-the-two-child-limit-gone-labour-must-go-further,"If the government’s long-awaited child poverty strategy, launched on Friday, was a bit of a damp squib, that is because the best bit had been absorbed by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in last month’s budget. The decision to remove the two-child limit, which prevented parents from claiming child-linked benefits for third or subsequent children, is expected to lift 550,000 children out of poverty by the end of this parliament. It is the best welfare decision taken by Labour since they were elected. Ms Reeves was correct to press the point that “potential suffocated by limited life chances” is a blight on society as well as on those who experience it directly. No wonder that Labour ministers and MPs have sounded confident when talking about it. The Conservative decision to make larger families poorer was unjustifiable and damaging. Stories of children lacking the basics of sufficient food and secure housing have become shamefully common. With a record 4.5 million children in the UK in poverty, and 2 million in “deep material poverty” – in households that cannot afford the essentials of life – action was overdue. The Scottish government has already introduced new child payments, putting incomes there on a different trajectory. The extension of free school meals in England is expected to lift about 100,000 more children out of poverty. But while none of the measures in the new strategy match this, or the removal of the two-child limit, for impact, the document still matters. First, because it is the clearest statement so far of Labour’s intent. Child poverty has fallen under every Labour prime minister since Harold Wilson in 1974. Under Conservative governments it has consistently risen. While the 2025 strategy lacks the ambition of Tony Blair’s pledge to eliminate child poverty entirely, it at least establishes that the current government’s commitment to poverty reduction is real. Second, some significant measures will improve lives, even if they will not shift the headline figures. That 2,000 families with children are stuck in B&amp;B accommodation is a stain on the nation. The £8m funding behind a pilot scheme to help councils rehouse them within six weeks is modest. But it is good to see the government commit to help local authorities tackle this issue. The shortage of social and affordable housing, and the problems this causes for families forced to rent privately, are one of the worst social injustices in this country. By doing something about it, ministers have shown that they are capable of listening. The same is true of changes making it easier for benefit claimants to pay for childcare. Deep unfairness remains baked in to the benefits system. The overall cap that limits how much households can claim, and the frozen local housing allowance that lags behind rents, painfully restrict the incomes of millions of people. Now that the two-child limit is gone, attention can shift to these other areas. Polling shows that attitudes to benefits are complicated and changeable. Most people remain committed to a robust safety net. But public debate is warped by myths, such as the one that costs are spiralling or people are increasingly reluctant to work – when the truth is that spending on working-age benefits is stable, and nearly three-quarters of children in poverty have a parent in work. Ministers must be bolder in challenging such narratives. Labour should be proud that the UK government once again has a child poverty strategy. Now it must build on it."
commentisfree_2025_dec_05_trump-administration-opening-fire-drowning-men.txt,opinion,2025-12-05,Jonathan Freedland,The Trump administration sinks to a new low – opening fire on drowning men,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/05/trump-administration-opening-fire-drowning-men,"The Trump administration looks ever more like a criminal enterprise – and now it seems to have added war crimes to its repertoire. Though even that may be too generous a description. On Thursday, word came that the US military had launched yet another deadly strike on a small boat moving through international waters. This time the attack killed four people, bringing to at least 87 the number of people the US has killed in a series of 22 such strikes on what it says are drug boats – vessels carrying illicit narcotics in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific. This has been happening for months, but the issue has only just drawn political heat thanks to a Washington Post investigation of the first such attack on 2 September. The paper reported that US forces hit the targeted boat once, then hit it again – the second strike killing two survivors clinging to the wreckage. According to the Post, the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, had issued a verbal command to “kill them all”. Now that incident is under congressional scrutiny, with even some Republicans uneasy about what appears to be a clearcut case of a war crime. The defence department’s own Law of War manual forbids precisely this kind of action, spelling it out in black and white on page 448: “Members of the armed forced and other persons … who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances.” Not that you should need a manual to tell you that. The law of the sea demands that you rescue those at risk of drowning; basic human decency demands that you don’t fire on them. Trump loyalists have denied that Hegseth gave an explicit order that everyone on board be killed and have tried to argue that the two men in the water were legitimate targets because they had proved themselves to be still “in the fight”, perhaps by calling in help from fellow “narco terrorists” nearby. Democrats who have seen the same classified footage of the incident say that, on the contrary, the video shows the killing of men in distress, their vessel destroyed and posing no threat. That would constitute a war crime, but for one thing: there is no war. The Trump administration says that the boats in its sights are ferrying drugs – fentanyl and the like, which kill Americans – from Venezuela to the US and that the traffickers are part of a “designated terrorist organisation”. In effect, it argues that the “war on drugs” is an actual war, in which the US military has the right to act as it would against any other armed enemy. But the laws of war don’t work like that. As Sarah Yager of Human Rights Watch explained to the Guardian, a US president “can’t just make up a conflict”. Of course, Donald Trump would dismiss the demand that for a war to be legal it has first to be declared by a congressional vote, but harder to brush off is the fact that the supposed enemy in this case poses nothing that could reasonably be described as a military threat. These are small boats that may or not be carrying drugs, with no serious means of defending themselves. The right way to deal with the danger they represent is the way they were dealt with under previous administrations – as a policing operation involving interception and arrest. In other words, the problem here is not just the “double tap” incident that killed those two shipwreck survivors. It is the entire, months-long operation which has killed 87. In Yager’s words: “Nobody on those boats can be killed legally by the United States military.” Viewed like this, we are not contemplating a war crime on 2 September so much as a string of crimes: extrajudicial killings that, simply put, look like murder. There could hardly be a graver charge, yet how has Hegseth himself responded? By posting a mocked-up cover of a children’s book, depicting the much-loved character Franklin the Turtle apparently aiming a rocket launcher at a group of boats, under the imagined title, Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists. As Logan Roy might put it, this is not a serious person. There is no need to pretend that Hegseth’s actions amount to the sullying of a previously clean reputation; no one is under any illusions as to the long and appalling record of the US in Latin America. Even so, the Trump administration is somehow managing to plumb new depths – and not only in that part of the world. Europeans have long been alarmed at Trump’s lopsided approach to the Ukraine war, evinced most recently by his unveiling of a supposed peace plan that the White House was compelled to deny had originated in Russia, so closely did it resemble a Kremlin wishlist. The sixth and latest visit to Moscow of Trump’s golfing buddy and personal envoy, Steve Witkoff, this week, and his chumminess with Vladimir Putin, did little to dispel that impression. For a while, this closeness to Russia intrigued observers. Could the explanation really be that Putin held damaging kompromat on the US president? It seems the answer centres on a lust that is almost as basic: not sex, but money. What’s driving Team Trump’s push to end the war is not the hope of restoring Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence but rather the desire to cut a deal that would bring US businesses hundreds of billions of dollars. According to a major probe by the Wall Street Journal, what Witkoff and Kirill Dmitriev, Putin’s handpicked envoy, have been negotiating in closed-door meetings in Miami and elsewhere is a grand bargain that would “bring Russia’s $2tn economy in from the cold”, while giving the US a slice of the action, whether access to $300bn or so of Russian central bank assets frozen in Europe or joint US-Russian ventures to exploit the enormous mineral wealth of the Arctic. Russia would end its isolation, Americans would get even richer and – an added bonus for Moscow – those pesky Europeans would be cut out. In the words of the Polish prime minister Donald Tusk: “We know this is not about peace. It’s about business.” And to be clear, that business motive is not solely about enlarging the coffers of the US Treasury to benefit the hard-pressed US taxpayer. Note how Jared Kushner, who joined Witkoff in Moscow this week, saw his investment fund, Affinity Partners, enjoy billion-dollar cash infusions from the very Gulf monarchies with whom he negotiated as a White House official during his father-in-law’s first term. In Trump world, the boundary between public and private does not exist: what profits the US profits Trump and his circle. A favourite example, if only for its vivid clarity, was the meeting this summer on board a superyacht moored off the coast of Sardinia. Present was Witkoff and a member of the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates in charge of $1.5tn of the UAE’s sovereign wealth. The two men had much to celebrate. In May, it had been announced that one of the sheikh’s investment firms would deposit $2bn into World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency outfit founded by the Witkoff and Trump families. Two weeks later, the White House granted the UAE access to specialist AI computer chips that had previously been off-limits, thanks to national security fears that the chips might find their way to China. What a happy coincidence it was that those two unrelated events followed each other so swiftly, and how convivial that encounter in Sardinia must have been. The word corruption can be used in two ways. In its legal sense, it can refer to dishonest conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery. But it can also have a deeper meaning, referring to the corrosion of standards, the decline of norms and the removal of moral restraints. If and when Donald Trump and those who serve him, and themselves, are eventually called to account, they will be confronted by that single word, in all its shades – and all its force.

commentisfree_2025_nov_26_meghan-duchess-of-sussex-harry.txt,opinion,2025-11-26,Arwa Mahdawi,Why on earth would Meghan still want to be called the Duchess of Sussex?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/26/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-harry,"Meghan may be a resident of Montecito, California, but she is still the Duchess of Sussex, and she won’t let us commoners forget it. Despite their highly publicised separation from the royal family, Harry and Meghan remain extraordinarily loyal to their fancy titles. They have been asked before why they cling to their aristocratic honorifics and shrugged off the question. “What difference would that make?” Harry told Anderson Cooper in 2023, when asked why the couple didn’t renounce the titles. The difference, Mr Duke, is that people might stop wondering why you and Megs are so keen on reminding everyone that you’re royals, while living in a country that famously has no monarchy. And this question isn’t going away. It keeps popping up and it’s back in the news now thanks to a Harper’s Bazaar cover story on Meghan. “After years of being subsumed by other people’s narratives, the Duchess of Sussex is ready to author her own next chapter,” the profile proclaims. And then a little detail that has taken the internet by storm. The magazine writer enters the luxury New York home of one of Meghan’s friends and notes: “The house manager announces, ‘Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,’ even though we appear to be the only other two people in the house.” The woman so keen on authoring her own next chapter apparently continues to insist on being called by a title she received via marriage from an institution she seems to disdain. Before all the Meghan fans come rushing in ready to fight: yes, the duchess was given a terrible time by the royals and the British press. But two things can be true at once: one can acknowledge that Meghan was treated poorly while also noting that she and Harry seem awfully keen to enjoy all the privileges of royalty, without many of the responsibilities. This seems to be a theme with the Sussexes. The Harper’s Bazaar profile explains the reason Meghan was at her friend’s New York pad for that interview was that she and Harry were in the city to receive the Humanitarians of the Year award from a mental health not-for-profit organisation. Have the pair done good work raising awareness about important issues? Sure. Do they deserve to be known as “humanitarians of the year” when there are large numbers of underpaid and underappreciated humanitarian workers risking their lives in war zones? No, they don’t. And this is why so many people have a problem with the Sussexes. Because they seem obsessed with titles and accolades without putting in the grunt work that normally goes along with them. I can think of a few words for people like that – and it’s not “duchess” or “duke”. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

commentisfree_2025_nov_26_queens-political-bellwether-america.txt,opinion,2025-11-26,Michael Massing,Is Queens the new political bellwether of America?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/26/queens-political-bellwether-america,"As the extraordinary Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani shows, there’s a new bellwether in American politics. For years, Ohio played that role. In every election from 1964 to 2016, the state voted for the winning presidential candidate, and every four years journalists would travel there to interview voters in Columbus and Cincinnati, Dayton and Youngstown. But in 2020 Biden won without carrying the state, and today Ohio is deeply red, costing it its bellwether status. Several other states once considered battlegrounds – Iowa, Missouri, and Florida – have also turned firmly Republican. But now a new bellwether has emerged: Queens. This humble New York borough contains multitudes. With a population of 2.3 million, it would be the nation’s fifth largest city if it stood alone. And in diversity it is without peer. Nearly half of Queens residents are foreign born. It is about a quarter white, a quarter Latino, nearly a quarter Asian and 17% Black, and 140 languages are spoken there. It’s home to Citi Field and the USTA Tennis Center, LaGuardia and John F Kennedy airports, MoMA PS1 and Aqueduct Racetrack, Archie Bunker of All in the Family and Awkwafina of Nora from Queens. Flushing is home to so many Asians that its downtown is known as the Chinese Times Square. Astoria has one of the largest Greek populations outside of Greece; Jackson Heights is known as “Little Colombia”; Woodside has a “Little Manila”. Jamaica is home to large African American, Caribbean and Central American populations, while Long Island City has become a magnet for the hip and arty. Queens also has New York’s largest Muslim population as well as 150,000 Jews. Overall, it is thoroughly middle and working class – a swath of heartland America set down in pulsating, cosmopolitan New York. Like all other New York boroughs except Staten Island, Queens reliably votes Democratic, but in November 2024 it moved decisively toward Trump. Where Joe Biden in 2020 won Queens by 72% to 27% – a 45-point margin – Kamala Harris in 2024 won it by only 24 points. Trump’s gains were especially large in heavily Latino, Chinese and south Asian neighborhoods. Many of those voting for him were propelled by the rise in disorder that had occurred in the wake of the pandemic and then exacerbated by the sudden influx of migrants. The placement of the migrants in makeshift shelters in residential neighborhoods without adequate support services led to a wave of complaints about crime and loitering as well as resentment over the diversion of resources from longtime residents. As in many other districts, the rise in rents and the cost of groceries contributed to a sense among many that the path to the middle class was becoming increasingly narrow. A political realignment seemed under way. Yet even as Trump was making such inroads, the democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was winning 69% of the vote in her congressional district, which straddles northern Queens and the South Bronx. And, as dissatisfaction with the status quo surged and concerns over affordability mounted, support grew for another young insurgent – Zohran Mamdani. A state assemblyman whose district includes parts of Astoria and Long Island City, Mamdani in the 24 June Democratic primary won support from a mixed salad of leftish young professionals, working-class Latinos, and recently arrived south Asians – all drawn to his bread-and-butter platform of universal childcare, free buses and a rent freeze. Groups like Drum Beats (Desis Rising Up &amp; Moving) canvassed tens of thousands of residents, including a Bangladeshi population that has tripled over the last decade. In the general election, Mamdani got 47.3% of the votes in Queens. “Some of the areas that have been trending towards Trump went for Mamdani,” observed John Mollenkopf, a professor of political science at the Cuny Graduate Center. Trump concurred. “A lot of my voters voted for him,” the president said during his 21 November meeting with Mamdani. The session seemed to seal Queens’s political arrival. For Trump, too, is a product of the borough. He grew up in Jamaica Estates, a leafy upper-middle-class section located about 10 miles from Mamdani’s Astoria home. Both are anti-establishment figures with a knack for understanding and addressing the needs of those with “fingers bruised from lifting boxes on the warehouse floor, palms calloused from delivery by handlebars, [and] knuckles scarred with kitchen burns”, as Mamdani put it in his victory speech. With Ocasio-Cortez contemplating a run for higher office, Queens is proving an important seedbed for national politics, and New York-based journalists – rather than have to book flights to the midwest – can now hop on the 7 train to Jackson Heights or Flushing. Yet national news organizations have treated the borough like flyover country. The New York Times in particular has been a step behind. Back in the 90s, the paper had a sizable metro section that thoroughly covered the outer boroughs and the tristate region. But as the Times mushroomed into a global paper – it now has more readers in California than in New York – it has shortchanged the city’s blue-collar precincts. Today, driverless cars in San Francisco get as much coverage in the paper as taxi drivers in Corona. As a result, the Times, during the mayoral race, failed to grasp the groundswell developing behind Mamdani. And, when his strength did become evident, it was strangely dismissive and even hostile toward him, sniffing in an editorial that because of his lack of experience and concern about the disorder in the city, “we do not believe that Mr. Mamdani deserves a spot on New Yorkers’ ballots.” It followed with an “exposé” about how as a high school senior Mamdani (who was born in Uganda) had checked multiple boxes on his college application to Columbia about his race, purportedly to gain an advantage. Mamdani explained that he considered himself “an American who was born in Africa” and that his answers were an attempt to represent his complex background given the limited choices before him. The piece fed the perception that the Times was “on a crusade against Mamdani”, as Margaret Sullivan put it in the Guardian. After his victory, the paper, noting his ascension and Ocasio-Cortez’s continuing strength, ran a piece about how Queens “is having its moment”. With the borough claiming three of the top four spots in a survey of city-neighborhoods-to-watch in 2025; with Astoria emerging as a favorite among young professionals; and with the Rockaways becoming a summer staple, the Times observed, “Could Queens become the new Brooklyn?” It already is the new Ohio.

Our panel responds,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/26/rachel-reeves-budget-panel-chancellor,"This was a Labour budget – it reminds us there can be a better Britain Polly Toynbee Guardian columnist This budget will be remembered for finally abolishing the monstrous two-child benefit cap. That’s what Labour budgets do, boosting the low-paid, taking from the well-off. Children always come first, as 450,000 will be released from poverty, more than in any budget before. The chancellor reeled off Labour’s too often ignored child-first priorities: universal nurseries from nine months, breakfast clubs, more free school meals, school libraries, a youth guarantee. No, not back to 2010, but it’s progress. This doesn’t totally restore Sure Start, but in Best Start we see the beginnings of its rebirth. After four months of tortured U-turns, dithering and leaking that spooked markets and paralysed spending, here is a far better budget than doomster predictions. But there should have been a political rolling out of the red carpet in advance to announce a redder budget than expected. Those with least got most: £900 more per year for 2.4 million people on the minimum wage. Prescriptions and fuel duty are frozen, frozen rail fares will save commuters around £300 a year. Energy bills are eased by taking the green levies back to the Treasury. It was high time to restore a little justice by taxing properties worth more than £2m. But, yes, the freezing of income tax thresholds amounts to the income tax rise that was pledged against. May all other future chancellors learn from Rachel Reeves’s original great sin, binding herself in iron fiscal chains. Never again. Labour’s enemies will of course ferociously tear all this apart. How the opposite benches howled down abolishing the benefit cap. Alas, this dissent is backed by a majority of the public, who think scroungers have babies-on-benefits. Not so – all evidence shows it has minimal effect on birth rate. But this is a country mainly nurtured through the years on mean-minded Toryism. A Labour government now and then, with Labour budgets, reminds us that there is a better Britain that can do good. Not enough, not brave or radical enough. I don’t know if this will help reverse Labour’s desperate political misfortunes, but it should at least remind people who have lost trust what Labour governments are for. I’ll say it: this budget didn’t hit the rich hard enough Julia Davies Millionaire investor, lawyer and a member of Patriotic Millionaires First and foremost, it is wrong to ask working people to contribute more through freezing income tax thresholds, while the wealthiest in society are broadly left untouched. In a country with such extraordinary levels of wealth at the very top, the government should be looking to those most able to contribute more, not turning to those who are already doing their part. The additional council tax surcharge on homes worth more than £2m and higher rates on investment income show a limited willingness to move in the right direction. These steps are far too small to make any real impact on the levels of inequality we are expected to tolerate. This lack of ambition on taxing the super-rich does not meet the needs of the moment. Instead, it shifts yet more pressure on to everyone else. If the government chooses to reverse course on today’s decisions, there is still time to create a tax system that works for everyone. What our country needs is determination, will and clarity of purpose from our political leaders to deliver an economy that works for all of us, not just people like me. The members of Patriotic Millionaires and I will continue to push our government for ambitious economic reform. The UK cannot afford any further piecemeal approach to the economy. While an annual wealth tax is not a panacea, it signals the kind of change required to put people first and address deep-rooted inequality. There is still time in this parliament to achieve this. A ‘mansion tax’ sounds good, but it’s not the reform we need Abi O'Connor Urban sociologist and honorary fellow at the University of Liverpool Our housing system is a key driver of the gap between rich and poor in society. This is because council tax bands have not been recalibrated since 1991. Retaining this system reinforces regional inequality and ensures the most expensive homes are chronically undertaxed. While increasing council tax on homes worth more than £2m is a small step in the right direction from this government, it lacks the ambition the country was promised. Genuine reform could be achieved by simply implementing proportional property tax, in which every home’s tax rate is set annually in line with its actual market value. It is right that the wealthiest pay more, and it is right that unearned wealth via assets such as property is taxed appropriately, yet this watered-down “mansion tax” alone will raise only a tiny sum (£400m), and not before 2028. We need a wholesale re-evaluation of how all property is taxed. This will be foundational to rebalancing the housing system and raising public money, therefore today’s announcement is a deflection from the fundamental issue: our inherently regressive council tax system. If this is a tax-raising budget guided by Labour values, why has it shied away from a widely accepted reform that would raise significant finance and address a key driver of inequality? Unfortunately, this budget is emblematic of Labour’s parliament thus far: mired with missed opportunities. This government is clutching at straws because it lacks the courage to tax the wealthiest adequately, and the conviction to properly support the millions struggling to pay their rent and bills. Where’s the offer for young people? Jason Okundaye Assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian For years now, young people have said they feel overlooked by the government’s spending priorities, and this budget is no exception. Announcements of an above-inflation 4.8% increase in the state pension have been paired with a £2,000 per year cap on national insurance-free salary sacrifice schemes for those saving for a pension. This is particularly unfair for middle-income young people, as their prudent financial planning is turned into another opportunity for a tax raid – and with fears that we are unlikely to see the same state pension as boomers when we retire, we will be even more dependent on these private pots. A freeze on tax thresholds becomes a tax-by-stealth. Even minimum wage increases for 18– to 20-year-olds are portended by the Resolution Foundation as driving unemployment, at a time when nearly a million young people are economically inactive. Further, reforms to the Isa allowance for under-65s, with £8,000 of the £20,000 now designated for special stocks-and-shares Isa options, will surely restrict savings for the future. It is right to address the low rates of retail investment and encourage engagement with the stock market, but with young people having grown up under the shadow of the 2008 financial crisis and Covid, and with the threat of the AI bubble bursting, they should be able to commit the full amount to fixed-rate, low-risk accounts if they wish. These may feel like only the concerns of a high-income fraction, but in the absence of packaged offers for young people, the narrative that emerges is one of a broken social contract. Highly educated middle-earners and Henrys (high earners, not rich yet) ask where the promised reward of stability is after pursuing competitive degrees and intense jobs, while growing resentful at others they believe are getting a free ride (see the popular “Nicolas, 30 ans” meme). And if this golden ticket of education and work is false, then why not forgo it and try to get rich quick with crypto? I believe in progressive taxation, and as a childless gen Z I am happy for my taxes to go to breakfast clubs and lifting the two-child benefit cap. But the lack of concessions for young workers is invariably driving some others to the right, who direct their angst towards recipients of welfare, social housing occupants, migrants and pensioners. Pensioner poverty is a real issue, yet the image of cruise-taking over-65s funded by the young dominates. The UK has plenty of taxes – what are we getting for all this new spending? John Redwood Conservative MP for Wokingham from 1987 to 2024 The budget is bad for industry, bad for jobs, bad for young people trying to get a start in life and find an affordable home, bad for savings and investment and bad for growth. Allowing a two-month run-in with scare stories about every kind of tax rise hit confidence. It stopped some businesses offering new jobs and committing to new investments. The shadow of the first disastrous budget loomed over the country as we saw for ourselves unemployment rise, job vacancies fall, inflation go up and growth stumble to nothing as the budget measures hit home. This time the chancellor was ready with her excuses. She has latched on to the misleading Office for Budget Responsibility forecast of a 4% hit to UK GDP from Brexit, meant to occur over a 15-year period. We know this was wrong as UK GDP growth outperformed major EU countries such as France and Germany in many of the post-referendum years. Reeves seeks to assist a PM who thinks we should spend large sums on joining EU projects, including a preposterous £5bn to allow companies to bid for defence contracts, contrary to world trade rules. Why not spend the money on buying UK weapons for our own military? The UK is not short of taxes. The government plans to spend £185bn more next year than in the last full year under the Conservatives. What will we get for all that cash? How much of it is going on more illegal migrants and low pay, or no-pay legal migrants and their hotel and housing needs? How much on the huge losses of the Bank of England? How much on needlessly giving away the Chagos islands? More taxes will do us harm and encourage even more talented and wealthy people to leave. Some of the tax rises will cost us dear as those who could pay decide not to, avoiding taxes by leaving or by spending and investing less. The biggest losers are young people less likely to get a job or be able to afford a home of their own. Taking green policy costs off household bills is a good first step Sarah Nankivell Deputy director of Common Wealth Labour entered government suggesting that action on the climate would take care of the cost of living, almost automatically. It has rightly responded to rising anxieties around the latter by prioritising immediate relief to bills, while resisting the equally simplistic notion that net zero will cost households more. But room still remains to reduce the tension and maximise the complementarity. Successive governments’ resistance to tax rises has made electricity bills the vessel for green policy levies that could be funded through progressive general taxation. Moving these levies off bills is an important landmark – these policies have driven up electricity costs since the pandemic and made electricity structurally more expensive than gas. This precedent must be built upon. The budget’s announcements reaffirm the assumption that lower bills in the short term are only achievable by shifting costs from households to government while leaving the source of those costs unchanged. In particular, the energy companies, whose “renewables obligation” subsidies will now be majority-funded by government, have been enjoying handsome windfalls. In the meantime, the public are told to wait for new renewables to gradually reduce market prices. Another green levy removed from bills is the energy company obligation that funded part of the warm homes plan to reduce future demand. The plan is intended to help people with energy efficiency and insulation upgrades, so much will depend on how this is rolled out and whether it is adequately resourced. Ultimately the transition demands a scale of investment beyond existing commitments. Surging military spending redirects scarce manufacturing capacity away from technologies needed for the energy transition. The choice to sign up to Nato’s arbitrary 5% target – which Stockholm International Peace Research Institute suggests would mean finding an extra £136bn per year by 2035 – shows that fiscal rules can be bent and bond markets resisted when government decides. On tax, Reeves chose ad hoc revenue grabs over big changes Andy Summers Director of the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation and associate professor at London School of Economics and Political Science Law School This may feel like a “big budget” of tax reforms, but that’s only because successive governments have done so little in the way of serious reform that we’ve forgotten what it looks like. Overall, the tax changes announced today are unlikely to move the needle on growth much one way or the other. There is still no sense that the government has a vision for a good tax system, let alone a strategy for getting there. In this climate, the risk is that even moves in the right direction – such as on council tax – still come across as ad hoc revenue-grabs rather than principled efforts to make the tax system fairer and more efficient. For a government that’s supposedly obsessed with growth, we seem no closer to the realisation that our broken tax system is part of the UK’s growth problem, and that major structural reforms – not just rate-changes or more bolt-ons – are needed to fix it. A strategy for pro-growth tax reforms is already out there and ready to be picked up. Recently, authors from CenTax and eight other thinktanks from across the political spectrum declared agreement on the way ahead. It’s regrettable that this budget contains barely a hint of progress against any of the seven reform packages we proposed. For instance, reforming capital gains tax to provide a pro-growth investment allowance, alongside equalising the rate with income tax. And abolition of stamp duty alongside a full reform of council tax. Outside government, the need for serious tax reform is universally accepted and there is remarkable agreement over how to do it. We must turn our attention to the reasons why successive governments have failed to deliver, despite this consensus. It would be wise to start thinking about this now, because 10 weeks out from the next budget will be too late."

More like Operation Save Our Skins,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/26/rachel-reeves-labour-britain-finances-budget-tax-rises-fiscal-rules,"Imagine it: you are the chancellor of a government in mortal peril. Poll ratings are down the U-bend; backbenchers are mutinous and colleagues are circling around the prime minister, readying themselves to land the fatal blow. You have a budget, which may be your last chance to avert the inevitable. What do you do? If you’re Rachel Reeves, you use it to buy time. Time for Keir Starmer and you to carry on in office for a while longer, so perhaps your luck will change. Extra time for this unfortunate, empty, placeholder of a PM costs more than olive oil, but the chancellor still splashed out. This afternoon, she delivered a budget that was a £26bn attempt to buy her government some time. That £26bn will be paid not by businesses but by you and me, as taxes are pushed up to an all-time high. She will spend the cash to placate bond investors and calm down angry backbenchers by increasing the “headroom” to meet her own fiscal rules, and on measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap. And it will work, for a while. But even while many of those moves are good, they are small. Bundle up all the spending and tax policies and the budget is huge, but look at the measures one by one and they are mainly loose change. You can say the same about the likely impact of this budget. A little breather, yes – enough for this historically unpopular pair to stay in Downing Street a while longer. But a gamechanger? No. When the public judge Starmer and Reeves as worse than the calamity couple of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, then however unfair the situation, it’s beyond saving. Such desperation has marked this budget from the start, through all the leaks and bungling. A “circus” is how the Bank of England’s former chief economist Andy Haldane describes it – and that was before some poor sod at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had an off-day. Except circuses are meant to be fun. All this speculation has achieved has been to put businesses off investing and crushed growth, as even the Bank murmurs discreetly in its latest monetary policy report. Governments use budgets to set an agenda, tell a story, pick a side. Remember Gordon Brown and his crusade to end child poverty, which he very nearly won. Think of George Osborne and his drive to squeeze public services and social security. Years before he brought in the loathsome child-benefit cap, David Cameron was arguing for it. Then look at our first female chancellor, obviously gifted and Labour to her fingertips, but unable to show us why. Why she’s in No 11, what she wants to do with power, or even with this budget. The brutal truth, as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation observes, is that the vast majority of the taxes raised today will go on padding out the margin to meet her fiscal rules. Another slug will be spent on paying for all those U-turns forced on Reeves and Starmer. Only 20% will go on new measures “actually making people better off”. What a way to waste a landslide majority. Small measures to improve voters’ lives – cutting energy bills, freezing train fares and prescription charges – will barely be noticed against a backdrop of rising bills (especially for food) and flat wages. Almost a million workers will be dragged into the 40% higher tax band by the end of this year, even while public services continue to struggle. For all the extra billions that have gone to Wes Streeting, it’s not enough to make up the lag at the NHS: 22% of patients wait more than six weeks for diagnostic tests, MPs reported recently. The standard is meant to be 1%. The MPs expressed “significant concerns” that the shake-up of NHS England “has been announced without either delivery plans or funding in place”. If you are already worrying about the prospect of 2029 bringing Nigel Farage into No 10, then look at the finding from the OBR on how household take-home pay will rise over the rest of this decade. Because it will barely rise at all: just 0.25% a year every year until the general election. That is what a cost of living crisis looks like – but it’s also how a political breakdown takes hold. It’s well down even on the 2010s, the rage-filled decade that gave us Brexit. In her eagerness to become Labour’s first chancellor in 15 years, Reeves made three big offers. To gee up the Labour base, she promised an end to austerity. To win over Tories, she pledged that none of the big three taxes would go up. And to make peace with financial markets, she tied herself up with fiscal rules that are simply too tight. As I and a few others argued at the time, these three goals are incompatible. To deliver capital-C change you need to raise revenue or borrow. Most of all, you need to level with voters and tell them that without this money, their kids’ classrooms will continue to leak and their parents will wait for ever to get their cataracts done. Labour never came clean. It blustered about growth, then broke its manifesto promise by hitting employers with a rise in national insurance. Wednesday’s big stealth rise in taxes breaks its promises again. And for what? To save its skin. The very regime adopted by Reeves to ensure stability – relying on the OBR despite poor forecasts and productivity downgrades, tying herself into tight fiscal rules – is a large part of why this government is so unstable. And Westminster turbulence will roil financial markets. Asset managers are already sending out slide decks giving their views on which of the possible replacements for Starmer in No 10 will be best for gilt investors. Andy Burnham, who warned of a government “in hock” to bond markets, is not viewed too highly, you won’t be surprised to learn. Rather more sobering is the implication that financial markets, while paying no party subs and wielding no votes, will have a say in choosing this country’s next prime minister. But all that is not a question for this week – and for that Starmer should thank Reeves, who has probably done enough to stave off an imminent collapse. For now. You can call this budget The One Where Rachel Buys Time but, as the old song goes, it’s always later than you think. I’ll be around for years and years, Reeves told Labour MPs this week. But she knows they’re measuring out the rest of her term, and that of her boss next door, in weeks and months.

commentisfree_2025_nov_26_teenage-dreams-jobs-artists-actors-athletes.txt,opinion,2025-11-26,Adrian Chiles,Teenage dreams are never practical. But where would we be without the people who chased theirs?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/26/teenage-dreams-jobs-artists-actors-athletes,"Who wants to crush a kid’s dreams? Not me. But what to say when asked by a teenager about a career in the media? With tens of thousands of media, journalism and other graduates crowding into the market every year, the chances of finding steady work, let alone stardom, are more remote than ever. There’s no advice I feel comfortable giving. Too often, I suck my teeth and tell them how hard it is, which surely invites them to wonder exactly how hard it can be if I’ve managed to pull it off. Fair point. But what’s the point encouraging them to chase something that probably isn’t there? Dispiriting. Dispiriting too, when you encounter the opposite of a teenage dreamer: the teenage realist. A few years ago, I was being shown around a secondary school in the Black Country with various worthies. A venerable member of the Cadbury family was in our group. Tremendously tall, stooping to hear what was said, he was kind and attentive, but not of a breed recognisable to any of the kids around us. Undaunted, the head boy led our group with some aplomb. He was but 16 – the school didn’t have a sixth form. He talked to us about the school in a mature, intelligent manner, but without a trace of precocity. In his own quiet way, he was quite something. This young man will go far, I thought. With this in mind, I asked him what he wanted to go on to study. He said he was looking at doing drama at a local college. “Oh, do you want to be an actor?” “No, I’d like to be a drama teacher.” I thought this was magnificent. A thousand other potential drama students of his age would have nothing short of stardom on their minds. But a sadness about it niggled away at me too. As someone in the group pointed out, if you can’t dream at the age of 16, then when can you dream? I interviewed Michael Sheen last Saturday. It turns out that when he was 12 years old his talent for football was spotted. A tap on the shoulder from a football scout was something I yearned for at that age but, I’m sorry to report, no scout ever gave me a second look. It was Arsenal, no less, who were keen to recruit the young, football-obsessed Michael. The club wanted him, perhaps the whole family, to leave Port Talbot in Wales for London. This they didn’t want to do, which is something he was later grateful for, reasoning that his chance of making it would have been so slim. And so it was that instead he ended up shooting for success in that famously accessible and secure line of work – acting. I must ask a bookmaker some time to give me the odds on a teenager making it in the fields of a) football b) acting and c) television presenting. Those odds will be long indeed, absurdly long. So long, in fact, that any young person making that bet on themselves is plainly mad and to be discouraged. But, talking to Michael, I had a couple of thoughts, not least that if I’d been at his school, with him excelling at football and acting and probably more besides, he’d have got right on my wick. But it also struck me that our cultural lives would be nothing without those who were once teenage dreamers. When it comes down to it, the athletes, musicians, writers and actors we so admire are all people who once made absurdly speculative long-shot bets on themselves to succeed, ignoring any and all sensible advice to wise up, get real and look for proper jobs instead. So let us salute the dreamers, the deluded shooters for the stars. For without them, the world would be a bare place indeed."

Scrapping the two‑child benefit cap, putting up gambling taxes, freezing rail fares and implementing a mansion tax are not just sensible moves – they are long overdue. As is a “managed transition” for the North Sea that supports workers while pivoting to clean energy, without abruptly ditching oil and gas. The country will be a better, fairer place for these measures. They should also assuage backbench anger over self-inflicted damage by the chancellor’s proposed welfare cuts and secure Ms Reeves’s position – for now. The dilemma at the heart of Ms Reeves’s fiscal strategy is that while individual policies may be progressive, the economic framework they sit inside is not. This is exposed by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Behind the signature policies lies a deeply conservative macro strategy. The budget will see £26bn in tax rises borne heavily by workers, falling investment, stagnant growth, flat wages and a fiscal debt rule met on a coin toss. The OBR warns that under Ms Reeves’s spending plans, unprotected services – councils, courts and police – will face Osborne-style cuts of 3.3% a year from 2029 to 2031 unless the Treasury finds £21bn extra. Her fiscal rule makes those cuts inevitable. This is at odds with the rosy picture painted by the Treasury, which reckons cuts bring growth. Having declared growth its “central mission” it then admits GDP will inch forward at just 1.5% a year. All of this is made worse by the drag from Brexit, which continues to depress trade and investment. The glaring gap between the OBR’s pessimism and the Treasury’s optimism cannot be ignored. So in the name of “policy certainty”, Ms Reeves will cut OBR scrutiny in half by reducing checks to one a year. Nothing says stability like fewer people checking the maths. In this budget Labour MPs get their headlines. The Treasury gets its cuts. And the public gets more stagnation. The lesson should be to change course. Both the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the New Economics Foundation focus on fairer fiscal policies, with the latter arguing for Ms Reeves to raise capital gains tax to the same rate as income tax. If Labour wants fairness, it must properly tax wealth, not just work. Frozen fuel duty is an idea well past its sell-by date. The OBR is blunt: cut the prices the state controls, like energy bills, and inflation falls – undermining the Treasury’s story. None of this negates the real gains for children and struggling families. These interventions matter: lifting the two-child cap will see 350,000 children pulled out of poverty. Transforming the life chances of the poorest should be the reason for a Labour government. It is welcome that ministers have recognised that rescuing public services and easing the cost of living is necessary. Whoever is chancellor in two years can accelerate this shift. The OBR has already given the game away: Ms Reeves’s numbers imply politically impossible cuts, and Labour will inevitably spend more cash at the next spending review. The system is now engineered so that the Treasury can “find” the money by revising up growth – conveniently without the OBR around to question the sleight of hand. But perhaps this reveals what Westminster often ignores: that money is political. The state can create fiscal space whenever it chooses, and the economy will revive when it spends. Stagnation ends when the government stops starving the system."

One plausible merit of an appointed chamber is that specialists might be recruited to apply non-political expertise in legislative scrutiny. Appointees are certainly not supposed to use their privileged position to advance the interests of paying clients. After a Guardian investigation, two peers were disciplined this week for breaking lobbying rules. Lord Dannatt, a former head of the British army who served as a crossbencher, and Lord Evans of Watford, a businessman and Labour peer, have been suspended for four and five months respectively. Both men were recorded by undercover Guardian reporters posing as property developers, discussing ways in which their Westminster contacts might be useful to advance potential clients’ access. The code of conduct for peers forbids the provision of parliamentary services for “payment or reward”. In a subsequent investigation, the Lords standards commissioner identified breaches by both men. Lord Dannatt had corresponded with ministers and officials about companies in which he held a financial interest. Lord Evans had sponsored events in parliament for a company owned by his son in which he had shares. These are unlikely to be exceptional cases. The upper chamber is overpopulated, poorly scrutinised and full of seasoned political operators, including party donors. It is culturally predisposed to scandals of this nature. It has more than 800 members. They are not salaried but claim a tax-free daily allowance of £371, plus expenses, payable regardless of how meaningfully they participate in the legislative process. In the 2019-24 parliament, 10% of peers accounted for more than half of contributions to the chamber. Multiple outside interests are normal. Too many peers treat the Palace of Westminster as little more than an exclusive members’ club, enjoying the status for its own sake or for the networking opportunities. Monetising the latter is easy, as this newspaper’s investigations have shown. Lobbying scandals are not confined to the Lords. Anyone with credible access to corridors of power is a potential target for businesses and other interests hoping to short-circuit formal channels of consultation. It is not illegal for a company to want to get a point of view across to a minister, nor is it necessarily unethical for former politicians to apply their experience as consultants. But the loyalty of serving parliamentarians is meant to be to the public. Even just a perception of conflicts of interest corrodes confidence in the political process. Some of these issues can be addressed with tougher regulation and greater transparency. In the Commons, rules around MPs taking paid consultancy work were tightened last year, although second jobs are still permitted. The essentially absurd character of the Lords will always be a problem. Reform was promised in Labour’s manifesto last year, although the ambition has shrunk as the government has been bogged down in other business. A bill to remove the remaining hereditary peers – a preposterous archaism – is, predictably, meeting resistance in the upper house. Any merit in outside experts sitting in the legislature is poor compensation for the lack of accountability in a system that packs the upper chamber with political appointees. Every scandal featuring peers is a reminder that British democracy is incomplete as long as the Lords is unreformed."
commentisfree_2025_nov_26_tv-influencers-i-love-la-hbo-show-of-the-year.txt,opinion,2025-11-26,Emma Brockes,"At last, TV about influencers that isn’t cringe – I Love LA is my show of the year",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/26/tv-influencers-i-love-la-hbo-show-of-the-year,"It’s been a while since a TV show came along that people leaned into losing their minds about, but finally, and after a year of otherwise mediocre programming, we have one. I Love LA, the HBO comedy set among wannabe gen Z influencers, is only halfway through its eight-episode run, but it is already comfortably the best show of the year. And more importantly, it has triggered all the signifiers of event TV: obsessive repeat viewings, line-by-line coverage, big platform profiles of its stars and weekly recaps on Vulture, New York magazine’s website. Within days of each episode airing, people have transcribed and uploaded the entire script, which – with the best will in the world – no one’s doing for Riot Women. The surprising thing about this is not the fact that it’s the first show by Rachel Sennott, the show’s 30-year-old creator and star, or that the action takes place in a tiny world in east LA, but that content about influencers can be watchable at all. To date, millennial and older writers have tended to use social media as a lumbering plot device – oh my God, something’s gone “viral!” – or as a stand-in for the collapse of all known standards. You probably haven’t watched these because nobody did, but take your pick from: HBO’s one-season disaster The Girls on the Bus, in which an old-media reporter covers a US election race only to find that influencers – those pesky kids! – have stolen her patch. Or the equally horrific Netflix flop Girlboss, loosely based on the memoirs of Sophia Amoruso, the early influencer, and which not even a cameo by Cole Escola could save. Or Flack, the deathly Anna Paquin-fronted show about publicists trying to manage their clients’ social media, and an early red flag for which was the use of the word “maven” in the show’s publicity. Sennott’s elevator pitch for I Love LA was “Entourage for internet girls”, and unlike those other shows, she’s writing from inside the house: the series is based on her move from New York to LA in 2020 and her years of being young, broke and striving in a lonely and competitive city. As such, I Love LA is as current as Girls was in 2012 and tells the story of Maia, a new-hire entertainment manager trying to wrangle her old pal and only client, Tallulah, into taking off as an influencer, while hanging out with Charlie, an uber-gay stylist, and the nepo baby Alani, played deliciously by real nepo baby True Whitaker (daughter of Forest). The success of the show isn’t only about youth. At the risk of sounding like Tina Brown’s Substack, while there is definite buzz around the age of the show’s creator and actors and the fact that it feels like the first really authentic gen Z comedy, the show is as much about sensibility. I would say I Love LA has more in common with Platonic, the hit show about middle age on Apple TV+, than with much younger pieces. (There’s a great joke about Cara Delevingne in the Platonic pilot that could easily sit in the new HBO show.) And I Love LA has almost certainly benefited from the sheer amount of garbage on TV at the moment. That one with Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys, in which her chin wobble carries most of the drama and both their managers should’ve had a word about lighting (Rhys looks like the waxwork of a deposed dictator.) Or the new one with David Duchovny – if you got further than 10 minutes in, I commend you. Reviews for I Love LA haven’t been universally good; plenty of people point out that it takes a minute to find its footing. But it is so fresh and real that it makes even recent hits like Hacks look stagey and sitcom. Ultimately, it’s a question of confidence, and the show assumes you will catch the references to Diddy, understand why Kramer vs Kramer is funny, field the drive-by on the LA fires, and appreciate the comedic truth of, “What am I supposed to do, wait in line like an assistant at UTA?” The show occupies a world that the creators also live in and don’t feel inclined to explain. If you don’t get the line “I just wasted $612 on a straight fire victim queer-baiter,” then I Love LA invites you, politely, to return to the tepid pleasures of shows about women who hate their husbands and wonder if they’re living the wrong life (almost certainly, yes).

commentisfree_2025_nov_27_amazon-capitalist-era-free-markets-age-technofeudalism.txt,opinion,2025-11-27,Yanis Varoufakis,How Amazon turned our capitalist era of free markets into the age of technofeudalism,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/27/amazon-capitalist-era-free-markets-age-technofeudalism,"For the past six years, every Black Friday – that made-up carnival of consumption – Amazon workers and their allies have mobilised across the world in coordinated strikes and protests. At first glance, these disputes look like the standard struggle between a giant capitalist employer and the people who keep it running. But Amazon is no ordinary corporation. It is the clearest expression of what I call technofeudalism: a new economic order in which platforms behave like lords owning the fiefs that have replaced markets. To appreciate Amazon’s extraordinary power, we must recall the system it is helping to bury. Capitalism relied on markets and profit. Firms invested in productive capital, hired workers, produced commodities and lived or died by profit and loss. But the emerging order is one in which the most powerful capitalist firms have exited that market altogether. They own the digital infrastructure that everyone else must use to trade, work, communicate and live. Amazon sits at the apex of this new order because it owns the cloud computing platform – Amazon Web Services (AWS) – upon which other technological firms, such as Uber, rely, but also large parts of banking, healthcare, logistics, public administration, media and education sectors. Once these businesses are embedded in AWS, switching costs become prohibitive. Firms thus become vassals on Amazon’s vast cloud fief and surrender their customers’ data. In 2020, the European commission charged Amazon with using the sales data of other sellers to illegally gain an advantage in the European marketplace. Amazon fuses logistics, cloud infrastructure, data extraction and algorithmic command into one vertically integrated system. Inside Amazon’s warehouses, technofeudal domination takes a more visceral form. Workers are subjected to minute-by-minute surveillance: handheld scanners and other devices track their movements; algorithms measure their pace, track productivity and monitor behaviour. Amazon, however, has said that claims of excessive surveillance are “factually incorrect” and any recording was necessary for ensuring safety and efficiency in its operations. Consumers, too, are drawn into the system. Each click, scroll, search and purchase on Amazon trains its algorithms to predict our needs and manipulate our desires. We, effectively, labour so that Amazon’s cloud capital accumulates. Each time we buy, Amazon can take as much as 40% of the sale price from the sellers in what I call cloud rents. Governments have a job, ostensibly, to regulate behemoths such as Amazon, but they are also becoming its serfs as public institutions run their data and communications on Amazon servers. According to the Guardian, key ministerial departments that have contracts with AWS include the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, HMRC, the Ministry of Justice, the Cabinet Office and Defra. Unsurprisingly, cloud capital has invaded battlefields and the shadowy world of surveillance. Amazon Rekognition, launched in 2016, was aimed at law-enforcement bodies including ICE in the US. Palantir – the surveillance firm that produces software used in everything from counter-terrorism to predictive policing to ICE’s deportation machine – has a partnership with AWS. Amazon is also directly involved in Project Nimbus, the 2021 cloud contract through which Amazon and Google provide the Israeli state with advanced cloud computing, AI and secure data storage. Amazon is a technofeudal rentier owning the digital infrastructure on which privateers, states and societies depend. Thankfully, there are signs of a pushback. The campaign that brings workers and citizens together every Black Friday – Make Amazon Pay – recognises this transformation. What began as a fight for workers’ rights has grown into a coalition of unions, climate campaigners, tax justice groups, digital rights advocates and migrant and Palestine solidarity networks. They understand that Amazon’s reach extends across logistics, finance, governance, ecological destruction, surveillance and war. Its demands – decent wages, safe workplaces, collective bargaining, climate action, tax justice, curbs on Amazon’s vast water consumption, an end to its entanglement with surveillance agencies and military operations – are integrated. Together, they map the much needed unified resistance to technofeudal domination. In the early decades of industrial capitalism, cross-border worker solidarity was hard. Today, the resistance to cloud capital can use its own tools to coordinate at planetary scale. Campaigns such as Make Amazon Pay offer a glimpse of the alliances required to confront our new cloudalist overlords. It may be only a beginning – but it is a hopeful one.

commentisfree_2025_nov_27_australia-nature-laws-environment-relief-yet-foreboding.txt,opinion,2025-11-27,Georgina Woods,"The rewriting of Australia’s nature laws comes as a relief, yet I can’t help feel a sense of foreboding",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/27/australia-nature-laws-environment-relief-yet-foreboding,"I got a text from a biodiversity advocate around midday on Thursday asking me: are you glad, or sad? I wasn’t sure how to reply. The Australian parliament is amending the country’s environment laws. Thanks to negotiating by the Greens, the amended laws will not enable the fast-tracking of coal and gas mining, which the government had proposed. Decisions about coal and gas mines that harm water resources will be retained by the commonwealth and not given over wholly to state governments as the government had proposed. That is an enormous relief. And yet, I am filled with foreboding. The bill introduced into parliament only a few weeks ago proposed to take the country backwards in environmental protection. It sought to strip communities of participation in environmental decisions, hand decision-making about environmental harm to the states and territories and give the environment minister sweeping power to tailor environmental regulations for certain developments, companies or industries. The government made it clear from the outset that the convenience of business, the desire for “quick yesses” that could harm the natural environment, was its chief priority. It has been made clear that the government intends to grant fast-tracked approval to renewable energy developments and minerals mines. There is excited talk about “abundance” – which is code for sweeping forests, wetlands, woodlands and local communities out of the path of business, mining and development. The minister is adamant this can be done while protecting the environment, but my 25 years of experience with environmental regulation tell me that haste brings unintended consequences. It makes communities angry. It leads to losses of our beautiful natural heritage that are mourned for generations. It impoverishes us by eroding the natural ecosystems that actually create the “abundance” that makes our society. Sign up: AU Breaking News email There is no abundance without reciprocity and we will learn this, to our sorrow, in the years to come if we continue treating the natural world as a magic pudding that can be cut and cut and cut and will come again. Coal and gas mining will not be fast-tracked and for that I am very glad. But the government ruled out embedding any formal consideration of the impacts of greenhouse gas pollution, the effect of climate change on Australia’s natural heritage, into decision-making. Only a few months ago, Australia’s first national climate risk assessment itemised a devastating prognosis for Australia’s marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems across the continent if global warming exceeds the limits set down in the Paris climate agreement. It spoke of ecosystems collapsing and whole species dying out. The only way to prevent that warming is to stop the pollution that comes from burning coal, gas and oil for energy, and quickly. Indeed, an International Court of Justice advisory opinion has affirmed that all countries have a legal obligation to prevent climate harm and protect the climate system. For Australia, that means preventing the pollution from our energy exports. The greenhouse gas emissions from Australia’s energy exports, and the impact that this pollution is having on Australians, is not going to go away because the minister refuses to think about it, or because the prime minister is too squeamish to talk about it. The consequences will plague our descendents for generations to come, long after this generation of politicians are gone, but there will be more immediate demands from communities suffering the effects of climate change that will become increasingly impossible to ignore.

commentisfree_2025_nov_27_far-right-europe-progressive-parties-housing-crisis-research.txt,opinion,2025-11-27,"Tarik Abou-Chadi, Silja Häusermann and Björn Bremer",Europe’s housing crisis is fuelling the rise of the far right. Our research shows how to address it,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/27/far-right-europe-progressive-parties-housing-crisis-research,"Housing costs across Europe have become a growing burden for many households, both for those trying to buy and those trying to rent. Over the past decade, property prices have surged faster than incomes in many European countries. The same is true for rents, which have increased exponentially in large cities but have also increased substantially in suburban areas and smaller university towns. Given how much housing costs affect Europeans’ quality of life, it is comparatively absent from the agenda of progressive political parties. When politicians do emphasise housing, the focus is usually solely on building more houses. Former German chancellor Olaf Scholz, for example, promised to build 400,000 new homes in Germany every year – a goal his government failed to reach by some distance. At the same time, far-right parties such as the Freedom party (PVV) in the Netherlands or Chega in Portugal have made the housing affordability crisis into a campaign issue. Their equation is simple: housing should be available and affordable only for nationals. What are the hurdles that keep other parties from politicising housing? And what would a progressive European housing agenda look like? As part of the Progressive Politics Research Network – an initiative to promote social science research findings to a broader audience – we have published eight research briefs to that end. European societies fundamentally differ in how housing is organised. Home ownership remains the dominant form of housing in most European countries, but ownership rates vary significantly. In some countries – including Germany, Austria and Switzerland – more than half of the population lives in rented accommodation. And as home ownership becomes increasingly unaffordable, renting has become the modal form for younger people, especially in Europe’s larger cities. To compare housing politics across countries, it is helpful to think of two policy paradigms: housing as an asset v housing as a social right. In the housing as an asset approach, housing is seen as an investment to generate financial returns – a system that depends on rising prices. Over the past decades, this has become the dominant paradigm. Even parties of the left have significantly reduced social housing, deregulated rental markets and created new investment and market structures that affect house prices. These reforms have eroded housing as a social right. The inequalities of who can live where, and under what conditions, have created massive grievances among a large share of the population. These grievances contribute to the increasing electoral success of the radical right. If progressive parties want to reclaim this issue, they have to accept that housing is fundamentally a question of distribution and redistribution. They should not treat housing as an issue where parties simply compete over who is more competent, or who can deliver more units. Housing policy involves profound choices about who benefits and who bears costs, about the balance between markets and collective responsibility, about whether housing is primarily an asset or a social right. From a progressive perspective, the goal should be clear: housing needs to be affordable, secure and nonspeculative. To achieve this, progressive parties first need to reinvest in social housing as part of a broader strategy to increase supply. Yet simply recreating the social housing of the 1970s won’t work. Social housing cannot be revitalised today if it is only targeted at the poorest: tight eligibility rules can undermine cross-class political support and lead to stigmatisation and exclusion. As an example, in Vienna, around 40% of households live in limited-profit or public housing: this broad access, together with strong rental protections, helps build the broad political coalitions necessary to support sustained investment. Second, progressive housing policy must address both supply and distribution. The fixation on “build, build, build” misses a crucial fact: under-occupation of existing housing stock now rivals overcrowding in many European countries. In Germany, demographic factors – especially age – correlate with housing inequality more than income does. Younger households and immigrants face severe overcrowding, while older households are increasingly under-occupied. Policy must incentivise the redistribution of existing space alongside new construction. Third, increasing housing density is unavoidable but must be done correctly. Large-scale surveys from cities in Europe and the US show that public acceptance of densification depends critically on design and implementation. When projects include participatory governance, protect neighbourhood amenities and green space, and ensure affordability, resistance drops significantly. Densification without social inclusion and environmental sustainability will fail politically. This agenda requires substantial public investment. Wealth-to-income ratios are driven largely by housing booms, providing funding resources. While inheritance taxes remain unpopular, net wealth taxes and reformed capital gains taxes command public support – especially when revenues are credibly tied to popular investments such as affordable housing. Austria demonstrates how dedicated housing funds, fed by modest levies and reinvested profits from limited-profit providers, can sustain large-scale provision. Progressive parties must also leverage private investment strategically. Land-use planning, construction regulation, and public loans can be tied to conditions: obligations to reinvest profits, provide housing at cost-based rents, respect limited-profit constraints, or meet social and ecological criteria. Housing policy is not simply about market v state, but about steering both toward social ends. The European far right has seized on housing precisely because progressives have abandoned it. Their answer – blaming immigrants for scarcity – is both morally and economically wrong. However, it will continue to gain traction if the centre left offers only market solutions and technocratic supply-side fixes. Housing is fundamentally a question of distribution and social rights, not merely construction targets. It shapes who can live where, access what opportunities, and build what kind of life. A progressive housing agenda must be bold enough to challenge the norm that housing has become an asset for wealth accumulation, and ambitious enough to build the broad coalitions of support necessary for sustained public investment. Our research shows such policies can work and command public support. The question is whether progressive parties have the will to fight for them and offer a real alternative to the far right’s politics of scarcity and blame.

commentisfree_2025_nov_27_labour-budget-tory-two-child-benefit-cap.txt,opinion,2025-11-27,Lucy Powell,"By ending a cruel Tory social experiment, this budget clearly set out how Labour will fight the battle to renew Britain",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/27/labour-budget-tory-two-child-benefit-cap,"Yesterday the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, delivered a Labour budget. People have been asking for Labour’s purpose and values to be more clearly expressed. Through the choices made – a shift to a fairer tax system, targeting wealth to pay for tackling child poverty, good public services and the cost of living – we have clearly set out what we stand for. That’s why Labour MPs cheered in the Commons, and it’s why we are up for the fights to come. And it’s why the cries from the right began immediately. The central dividing line in British politics is once again on the economy. On the one side Labour, who want to change it so it benefits ordinary working people, and on the other, our political opponents, who support the status quo and the failed ideology of the past. We must now take on, and win, the argument. The Tories had 14 years to fix things and instead, by any measure, they got much worse. Their ideological austerity and trickle-down economics – tax breaks for the wealthy, cutting off investment (leaving us with low productivity and wages), and failing to support young people post-Covid – didn’t work. Living standards fell by the largest margin since records began, child poverty reached record levels, NHS waiting lists in England were the highest they’ve ever been, wages were stagnant, a housing crisis took hold, young people scarred by Covid were left on the scrapheap. The record of failure goes on. One budget alone can’t put all this right, so Labour has a long-term plan for renewal and for rewiring the country. And we have to go out and keep making the argument for why our approach will reap dividends. Take welfare spending and child poverty. Under the Tories, welfare spending significantly increased. As did child poverty, because they didn’t address the root causes: low pay, high housing costs, deep inequalities in education, health and regions. The state ends up paying more to deal with the symptoms instead of the cure. It’s why we are building more social housing than for a generation, increasing wages and new rights for workers, massively boosting investment in infrastructure and new industries, getting waiting lists down and bringing down the costs of childcare and energy as we drive for clean power. It’s also why we are absolutely right to use this budget to lift the two-child benefit cap. For eight long years, since George Osborne introduced it, poorer families with children have suffered from a cruel social experiment that was branded as fair for working people when it was anything but. Most of the families affected by it have a parent in work. It’s done nothing but push 300,000 more children into poverty – which, in the end, costs us more, as well as being callous and immoral. I know from my own constituency – where over 5,000 children will be lifted out of poverty as a result of ending the cap – the real impact it’s had. Children wearing £1 Matalan wellies as school shoes, children going to bed hungry and cold, living in cramped, mouldy homes, parents this Christmas relying on food banks for a modest meal or small gift for their kids. I also see the impact on schools, teachers, social workers, doctors and charities who are already stretched but have to divert time and resources to supporting children who are living with the consequences of deep poverty. Just one in four pupils from the poorest families achieve five good GCSEs, compared with nearly three in four among affluent families. This sets them up for the disadvantages they face throughout their lives: missed potential, financial struggles and ill health. Children who grew up in poverty are more likely to be unemployed or poor as adults. Confronting child poverty isn’t just a moral imperative, it is a long-term investment. Poverty costs the economy far, far more than the £3bn cost of lifting the two-child cap, or extending free school meals. That’s why we acted urgently in the budget, despite the very difficult economic context. Every day with this cap in place sees more than 100 additional children pushed into poverty. The effects of lifting it won’t happen overnight either, so acting early in the parliament was vital. The cap was a totem to 14 years of failed rightwing ideology. Now it is gone. We, as Labour, can also be clear that these measures are being paid for in a fair way – from a new gambling levy, closing tax loopholes and a new “mansion tax”. Fairness and purpose – that’s how we will win the battle of ideas. This budget is a clear statement that we won the election as Labour, and will govern as Labour. As I repeatedly said during my campaign to become deputy leader, we must seize back the political megaphone and set the agenda more strongly about what’s really wrong with the country and how we are fixing it. We’ve certainly done that this week. So let’s keep hold of it and win this fight about how we will renew Britain and tackle the deep inequalities holding us back.

commentisfree_2025_nov_27_rachel-reeves-budget-2025-labour-tax.txt,opinion,2025-11-27,Martin Kettle,"Rachel Reeves’s budget has inflamed, not calmed, Britain’s febrile mood",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/27/rachel-reeves-budget-2025-labour-tax,"Rachel Reeves’s chancellorship was already balanced on a knife-edge, even before the 2025 budget. After she delivered her second budget statement, it still is. Even more than usual, Wednesday’s speech was full of significant fiscal changes, altered spending commitments and adjusted economic forecasts, most of them accidentally (and, for journalists, conveniently) released a short while in advance by the obviously misnamed Office for Budget Responsibility. Politically, however, almost nothing has changed at all. Reeves arrived in the Treasury last year offering what she, like Keir Starmer, had promised as the Conservative years ebbed: competence, stability and, above all, a focus on economic growth. Her problem, despite her upbeat assessments, is that she has delivered none of them. Nothing about the 2025 budget guarantees any early change in that, however defiantly Reeves spoke about reversing the OBR’s reduced new growth and productivity forecasts. No one is more aware of the dispirited national mood than Reeves herself. In her pre-budget video, she acknowledged the public’s continuing frustration and anger. What she did not acknowledge – although she is painfully aware of it in private and it shaped big parts of her budget – was that the same frustration and anger that carried Labour into government is now threatening to sweep Labour out of it again. Only an incorrigible Labour optimist – and there are very few of these at the moment – could say the 2025 budget has calmed those feelings, let alone laid them to rest. In some respects, indeed, the 2025 budget has made things worse, and not simply because of the many tax rises which, do not delude yourself, are never popular. All this will be overstated by a largely hostile press, but it seems inevitable that the 2025 budget will be remembered for the many taxes Reeves put up, rather than for the big one, income tax, that in the end she did not. Between now and Christmas, political and media focus will be on whether Wednesday’s complex mix of new duties, stealth taxes and public spending hikes can cut it with the public, the bond markets and the Labour party. The budget blowbacks experienced in the past by chancellors such as Gordon Brown and George Osborne should remind all of them to expect the unintended. My own tuppenceworth is that higher taxes on private pension contributions may deter savings and boost consumer spending in quite significant ways for the economy. Right now, it is still the Labour party, particularly its fearful MPs and its candidates facing tough elections next May, that matters most in political terms. The backbenches seemed to welcome most of what Reeves announced – the end of the two-child benefit cap in particular. Hardly surprising this, since this became a budget designed to calm a fractious Labour party, not one aimed at swing voters in marginal seats. This remains a very vulnerable time for both Reeves and Starmer. Their party still holds a lot of power over them. This budget will not merely define Reeves’s career and Labour’s prospects. Anyone with good sense in Whitehall should use what happened in this budget to force a comprehensive rethink of the whole budget preparation process. The OBR’s humiliating premature launch was merely the last straw for a more general failure. The long run-in to a very late budget meant a loss of good decision-making. The official strategy of pre-budget leaking is also completely out of hand. It is disreputable, insults parliament, stokes public contempt, empowers journalists to speculate not report and weakens the chancellor’s authority. The 2025 experience has been an object lesson in how not to do things. It should be the last budget of this kind. A lot of these issues predate Reeves’s chancellorship. Yet it remains her responsibility. Her own original sin remains the irresponsible pre-election commitment not to raise the three key personal taxes in this parliament. This underlay the undignified on-again, off-again mixed messages in this year’s drawn-out pre-budget period. It also implied she did not know what she was doing. That judgment is boosted by the fact that lifting the child benefit relief cap sits awkwardly with Reeves’s previous protestations of fiscal prudence. A budget that pleases most of the Labour party in its fissiparous current state is probably a budget with something pretty seriously amiss with it. By Reeves’s own rather modest standards, her speech was decent performative politics. The content may have been grim, but the shape of the statement was smart. There were one or two jokes and some sharp back-and-forth with the opposition. None of this will have harmed her with the Labour benches. But she plainly does not command the Commons as a more powerful chancellor ought to do. Though one accepts that all too few modern ministers of all political tribes seem capable of doing this, it is still a weakness which limits her authority to do difficult things. The late Nigel Lawson used to say that, for all the indefensible absurdity of the British budget rituals and traditions, they nevertheless mean that, for one day of the year, more or less the entire nation is at least united in thinking about the economy. The problem for Reeves is that Lawson was right. As Hugo Young once wrote in these pages, budget day is the day when a chancellor does not have a single alibi. In volatile political times like ours, that is unlikely to be good news for Reeves. Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_nov_27_rachel-reeves-live-now-pay-later-budget-labour.txt,opinion,2025-11-27,Larry Elliott,"This was Rachel Reeves’s ‘live now, pay later’ budget. The big question is: what happens when ‘later’ arrives?",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/27/rachel-reeves-live-now-pay-later-budget-labour,"Some budgets are important but quickly forgotten. Some budgets are trivial but linger long in the memory. The package of measures Rachel Reeves has delivered is a rarity: a budget that matters and will go down in the history books. And perhaps not for the right reasons. Make no mistake, the buildup was shambolic, and real damage has been caused by the leaks and counter-leaks coming out of the Treasury. The early release by the Office for Budget Responsibility of the contents of what the chancellor had in store was a final, chaotic twist marring what was supposed to be Reeves’s big day. Despite the embarrassment of having pundits dissect her measures before she had actually announced them, the chancellor put in a combative performance, defending her policy choices and attacking the Conservatives for their record in office between 2010 and 2024. In this, she was helped no end by the still vivid memories of the Liz Truss mini-budget of three years ago. For Labour, Truss is the gift that keeps on giving. Expectations were so low ahead of the budget that it didn’t take much to exceed them. Things may yet unravel quickly, but the signs are that the package provides the chancellor – and the government – with a bit of much-needed breathing space. That’s because, after all the dire predictions of gaping black holes in the public finances, the OBR’s forecasts were not nearly as bad as the City pundits had expected. There was never any need to consider the heavily trailed 2p rise in the basic rate of income tax. Through a hodgepodge of other measures, Reeves has more than doubled the size of the buffer against any unexpected bad economic news to £22bn. But a breathing space is one thing; a sustained improvement in Labour’s political fortunes is quite another. The chancellor had best be hoping that her second budget is received better than her first, because the future of the government hangs on how well it goes down with two audiences: the financial markets and voters. Keeping both onside is going to prove a difficult – and perhaps impossible – task. The markets liked the fact that Reeves was increasing the size of her rainy-day fund to £22bn by the end of the decade, but were much less keen on the live now, pay later shape of the budget. Spending is increasing in the short term, but the higher taxes will only start to kick in as the date of the next election approaches, when the government will be looking to keep voters sweet. The markets are already starting to wonder how serious the commitment to financial rectitude actually is. Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo markets, summed up City scepticism when he commented: “Big spending increases front-loaded, massive tax increases and restraint has been back-loaded – the classic policy mix: jam today, pain tomorrow. I hardly think it seems credible.” But nor for that matter would be front-loading tax increases at a time when unemployment is rising and growth is stagnant. That would simply increase the real risk of the economy getting stuck in a doom loop of depressed activity leading to weaker public finances and hence pressure for still higher taxes or public spending cuts. There was already a Groundhog Day feel to Reeves’s second budget, and she will want to avoid another tax-raising package next year at all costs. Instead, she is banking on cuts to energy bills, the freezing of rail fares and the increase in the minimum wage to buy her a little time. It is possible, for example, that the reduction in inflation next year from lower energy bills will speed up the pace at which the Bank of England cuts interest rates. There are two problems with this approach. First, the giveaways are much more modest than the eventual tax increases, and the tax increases will hit even low-paid workers. Someone on the minimum wage working full-time will be paying an extra £137 a year by 2030 due to the extended freeze on tax thresholds. The second problem is that there is no guarantee that the Bank of England will accelerate cuts in interest rates, or that the financial markets will continue to have faith in the chancellor. Reeves and her fellow ministers talk a good game about how the government is turbo-charging growth, but there is precious little to show for it. Growth would indeed solve all sorts of problems. It would raise tax receipts, reduce the deficit and obviate the need for tough choices. Yet the budget contained no new supply-side measures that might boost the UK’s growth potential. For Reeves, the hope is that her package will do for Keir Starmer what Geoffrey Howe’s 1981 budget is supposed to have done for Margaret Thatcher: mark a turning point in the government’s fortunes. Then, too, the government was hugely unpopular. Then, too, the chancellor froze tax allowances. Little more than two years later, Thatcher won a second term in office by a landslide. Howe was in the happy position, in the days before Bank of England independence, of being able to announce a two percentage-point cut in interest rates on the day after his budget. That option is not available to Reeves. Nor is there likely to be a repeat of the Falklands war – arguably a bigger factor in Thatcher’s re-election than Howe’s budget. So Reeves can only sit tight and hope that something turns up. There is no guarantee that it will. Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_nov_27_thanksgiving-dinner-3pm.txt,opinion,2025-11-27,Dave Schilling,Eating Thanksgiving dinner at dinnertime is ludicrous. Here’s why,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/27/thanksgiving-dinner-3pm,"Without question, my favorite holiday is Thanksgiving. I relish the opportunity to appreciate all the wonderful things about life. I also love that it is simultaneously a holiday all about complaints, criticism and arguments. Every holiday should contain such multitudes. I might be feeling grateful for my blessings while also wishing the gravy had more salt in it. There’s something uniquely American about turning a holiday that’s meant to be a joyous celebration of abundance into a chance to vehemently disagree about something trivial. Of course, I love arguing about trivial things. In fact, that might be what I’m most grateful for. Thanksgiving traditions are fertile ground for arguments. What to eat and, even more crucially, when to eat. Every year, someone in your life – a family member, friend, know-it-all writer – will tell you they have settled the eternal debate about when to commence Thanksgiving dinner. Some (wrong) people think the word “dinner” should be taken literally, in the American sense. These strict constitutionalists can see no nuance in the holiday traditions and believe (falsely) that the meal should begin between 5pm and 7pm, when it’s properly dark outside. My family took the opposite path. My mother would start cooking the meal the day before, then get up early to keep cooking the day of. As food would be finished, we’d be able to eat it as we pleased. All the while, the TV would be tuned to either a James Bond marathon or a football game. My brother and I could leave and go to the movies and come back whenever we wanted. Perhaps what my mom was most grateful for was her freedom from us. Because of this lackadaisical approach, I have very few actual memories of Thanksgiving dinner. Instead, my mind wanders to the scene in Moonraker where the pigeon does a double take when James Bond rides a gondola through a piazza. While my experience is perhaps a bit extreme, it was at least clear-eyed about the most crucial facet of Thanksgiving. It is likely to be the largest meal you will have all year – a meal loaded up with carbs, fat and sugar. Many of you will be combining this depravity with alcohol or the weed-smoking jaunt dubbed the “cousin walk”. Why would you want to put your body through this anywhere close to bedtime? And when you’re with your family, why would you want your bedtime to be after 10pm? Those of us with evolved sensibilities, who aren’t beholden to literal readings of words like “dinner”, understand that the best time to start eating is 3pm. Let me walk you through it: eat a light breakfast, skip lunch, see a movie, and be back around 2.30pm at the latest. If you would rather stay in and watch football instead of the movie, resist the temptation to snack on cheese or whatever might be lying around the house while cooking is happening. If you’re the one cooking, that’s even better. Once 3pm rolls around, you’ll be starving. For the actual meal, you have full rights to eat as much as you want, because you now have hours to let your food digest, clean up, make small talk with relatives, and partake in all that other cheerful activity. Imagine if you wait until 6pm or, God forbid, 7pm or 8pm to eat Thanksgiving dinner. This means you need a real breakfast. You have to eat a midday meal in between. If you don’t eat, because you don’t want to be full before a giant, heavy dinner, you’ll be pestering your parents (or getting pestered by your kids) about when the food will be ready. You’ll devolve into some kind of rabid animal, pacing back and forth and waiting for the carcass to be dumped on the table. Thanksgiving goes from a time to reflect to a sadistic game of seeing how long you can go without basic sustenance. Thanksgiving is meant to be a grand occasion, a meal unlike any other in the calendar year. So why would we treat it like any other meal and slot it at night? I truly do think our culture has gotten hung up on the word “dinner”, which doesn’t even mean the same thing in every region of the United States. In some places, “dinner” is the word for “lunch”. Don’t ask me what “lunch” means there. Maybe that’s what they call a “cousin walk”. This is why I think it’s time to retire the term “dinner” from our Thanksgiving lexicon. We simply call it the “Thanksgiving feast” and embrace that it is the one and only meal we are having that day. That it should come at a nice, convenient time during the day. And that you absolutely should not watch GoldenEye with your family because of this scene. Please, don’t make the same mistake as I did. Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humorist"

As recently as 1950, only 30% of the world’s population were urban dwellers. This week, a United Nations report suggested that more than 80% of people are now urbanites, with most of those living in cities. London became the first city to reach a million inhabitants in the early 19th century. Now, almost 500 have done so. Jakarta, with 42 million residents, has just overtaken Tokyo as the most populous of the lot; nine of the 10 largest megacities are in Asia. The UN report revealed the scale of the recent population shift to towns and cities thanks to a new, standardised measure in place of the widely varying national criteria previously used. The urbanisation rate in its 2018 report was just 55%. Jakarta’s explosive growth – its population has grown almost 30-fold since 1950 – demonstrates both the costs of rapid urbanisation and the difficulties of addressing them. It is choked by traffic and pollution, regularly floods and is sinking fast due to the overextraction of groundwater. The government is now building a new administrative capital more than 1,000km away, in Borneo. But such projects have an uninspiring record. The new city of Nusantra is behind schedule and short on funding and would-be inhabitants. Most thriving cities are more spontaneous affairs. The typical image of urbanisation is of young people lured by the promise of prosperity. But the late urbanist Mike Davis also pointed to waves of migration driven by growing rural desperation thanks to agricultural deregulation and punishing fiscal policies enforced by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. In other cases, he wrote in his book Planet of Slums, “rural people no longer migrate to the city; it migrates to them” as urban sprawl encroaches on their land. The benefits of cities are obvious. They are hubs of productivity, creativity and diversity that boost social and economic development. New York City’s gross product – $1.8tn last year – easily exceeds the GDP of Turkey or Saudi Arabia. That helps to explain why some cities are growing stronger as political – even diplomatic – entities. Yet as in 19th century London, opportunities and services exist alongside monstrous inequality, overcrowded housing and substandard infrastructure. Diseases spread more rapidly in crowded conditions with highly mobile populations. The rational decisions of individuals – to find educational opportunities for their children, escape rural desperation or seek excitement – play out on a grand scale, demanding intervention. Most of the land that has been urbanised in the last 55 years was used for agriculture, endangering food security and despoiling the environment. Improved urban-rural links are needed to prevent the entrenchment of rural deprivation as older people are left behind, with few services. Global heating is creating new dangers, with urban dwellers disproportionately exposed to heatwaves and rising seas – and the poorest hit hardest. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, argued last year that sustainable and equitable urbanisation and fighting climate change are two sides of the same coin. While cities generate a huge share of emissions, they can also foster more efficient use of resources. Cities have always represented both opportunity and threat. They grow as if of their own accord, but their new inhabitants cannot flourish that way. Humans are a new urban species, still learning to adapt to the environment we created.

commentisfree_2025_nov_27_the-guardian-view-on-restricting-trial-by-jury-a-shabby-evasion-of-responsibility.txt,opinion,2025-11-27,Editorial,The Guardian view on restricting trial by jury: a shabby evasion of responsibility,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/27/the-guardian-view-on-restricting-trial-by-jury-a-shabby-evasion-of-responsibility,"Abolition of trial by jury in England and Wales in all but the most serious cases is not the official policy of Sir Keir Starmer’s government – yet. All the signs, however, are that it soon will be. The leak of a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) briefing this week suggests that the lord chancellor, David Lammy, has signed off a plan restricting jury trial to a narrow band of serious offences – murder, manslaughter, rape and cases passing a public interest test. An announcement could come soon, with legislation in the new year. If Mr Lammy has his way, a new lower tier of juryless crown courts would hear most cases now heard by juries. Those involving criminal charges carrying a maximum sentence of up to five years would be heard by judges in the planned crown court “bench division”. Juries would no longer hear fraud and financial crime cases either. This would mean a large majority of the more than 30,000 jury trials each year in England and Wales being heard instead by judges alone, at an estimated saving of 20% of trial time. Mr Lammy’s plan, if confirmed, goes beyond Sir Brian Leveson’s July report, commissioned by the MoJ, on the entire criminal justice system. Sir Brian set the limit to juryless trial at cases carrying a likely sentence of three years, not five. He also proposed that juryless trials could be heard by a judge sitting with two magistrates, potentially ensuring a lay element. Mr Lammy appears to have ignored these more sensible ideas. The context for the Leveson proposals and Mr Lammy’s move is the mounting backlog of criminal cases. The backlog is indisputable. It requires action. Some 78,000 crown court cases are waiting to be heard. Some defendants being charged today will not have their cases heard for three years. If nothing changes by March 2029, the MoJ projects that the backlog will reach 105,000, generating still lengthier delays. Jury trials for the most serious offences have doubled in length since 2001 – a genuine concern. Yet it is far from clear that juries – who only hear around 1% of all criminal cases – are particularly responsible for the wider criminal justice system crisis. To single out juries as the part of the system crying out for reform would be misleading and would not solve the larger problem, which involves the neglect of the magistrates courts too. The wider issue is that the MoJ has been an unprotected department in successive austerity public spending rounds. Funding was cut by 30% in the coalition years. The MoJ is still unprotected today. Covid compounded everything further, as did the rising complexity of investigations, including digital and financial crime, and of the trial process itself. The whole system has been knowingly rendered less efficient, even while demands on it have been increased. Juries are not the sole or even the main blockage in this. Nothing entitles the jury system to immunity from reform. There is an argument for reasoned restrictions on juries in particular cases, like fraud, for example, or in special circumstances, such as those already applying in Northern Ireland. But successive governments have made dangerous and deliberate spending choices to shrink the criminal justice system and thus make it less efficient. That policy could have been reversed in this week’s budget, if the government had wanted to. Taking its frustrations out on the iconic tradition of trial by jury is a shabby evasion of responsibility. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

commentisfree_2025_nov_27_two-child-benefit-limit-abolished-budget.txt,opinion,2025-11-27,Frances Ryan,The two-child limit is abolished at last. Watch out for the narrative that will follow,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/27/two-child-benefit-limit-abolished-budget,"And just like that, the two-child benefit limit was finally abolished. “I don’t intend to preside over a status quo that punishes children for the circumstances of their birth,” the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told the Commons, as she used the budget to scrap, from April 2026, one of Britain’s most controversial policies. Four hundred and fifty thousand children will be lifted out of poverty as a result. That means 450,000 children who won’t go to bed hungry any more or walk to school with holes in the soles of their shoes. That means Keir Starmer’s government, after 16 months in power and endless will-they-won’t-they procrastination, has – at last – done the right thing. Introduced by the Conservatives in 2017 to curb public spending and teach low-income parents that “children cost money”, the policy means parents can claim universal credit or tax credits only for their first two offspring. As of this summer, a staggering 1.7 million children lived in households affected by the policy. That’s one in nine kids who miss out on help worth £3,514 a year. Over nearly a decade, the cap has become a key part of the “war on welfare” narrative – and the key driver of worsening child poverty. The two-child limit fundamentally broke a core tenet of the welfare state: rather than helping a child because they are in need, it arbitrarily denied support based on the order of their birth. The notorious “rape clause” – in which women have to prove to the state that their third pregnancy was conceived without consent to get an exemption – came to symbolise the scale and casual cruelty of Tory austerity. As Reeves, Britain’s first female chancellor, said with palpable emotion on Wednesday, she won’t tolerate it. Labour MPs, charities and civil groups will all be relieved that the Treasury has finally found the funds to repeal it, though not everyone will forgive Reeves for the wait. Each day that she and Starmer prevaricated, an average of 109 more children were pushed into poverty. No one can pretend they didn’t know the harm it was causing. As far back as six years ago, research showed nearly all families affected by the limit were cutting back on food, medication, heating or clothing. Domestic violence survivors have long warned that the policy makes it harder to leave an abusive partner. Other women have said they felt pushed towards an abortion, often after their contraception failed. Politicians – both those with either a blue or a red rosette – let it continue anyway. But if those on the left rue Starmer’s failure to end the policy sooner as a sign of his abandonment of Labour values, those on the right will use its abolition – in a tax-raising budget – as proof that he is prioritising benefits claimants. Or as the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, put it on Wednesday: “The Labour party should be renamed the Welfare party.” Days before the budget, the Daily Mail published a poll asking readers whether Reeves should use a raid on the “salary sacrifice” tax break on private pensions to fund ending the two-child cap. Expect much more of this worker v shirker propaganda in the coming days, despite the fact nearly three in five families affected by the cap were already in work – and that any of us might lose a job or fall ill after having a child we could previously afford. Watch out also for the rise in anti-migrant sentiment adding a layer of racism to this longstanding classism. When the Times reported on the two-child limit’s effect on child poverty this week, it noted that rising immigration “may” be a “contributing factor” to hardship and large families, with white British people less likely than “Bangladeshi families” or “Pakistani families” to have three or more children. In recent days, hard-right social media accounts have been posting about the groups that will supposedly benefit from the policy change, often accompanied by unidentified photos of large minority-ethnic families. In the 2010s, the right’s fear was the working class breeding too much; in 2025, it’s working-class people who aren’t white. That Reeves felt she had to pair repealing the two-child limit with removing tax relief for the Motability scheme and leases for “luxury cars” for disabled people shows starkly the deal that she is making with the rightwing media and potential Reform voters. It is not enough to give children a warm meal because they are hungry. Ministers must justify it by reassuring critics they have not gone “soft on welfare”. Compassion, it seems, comes with a footnote. There are moments in politics to celebrate and there are moments to not be complacent. Sometimes, it is both at once. Eight years of campaigning, court cases and a change in government have at last rid the country of the scourge of the benefit limit. Hundreds of thousands of children will be safer; their parents less afraid. And yet the energy it took to get here and the backlash it has already provoked show starkly how progress is an uphill battle. Decency is not a simple sell. Prejudice and resentment are, sadly, much easier to spread. The most obvious of truths – that every child matters, that some things go beyond partisan point-scoring – are, to some, not obvious at all. Cheer the victory today. Tomorrow, the fight continues. The two-child limit is at last abolished but the sentiment that created it is alive and well. Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_nov_27_zohran-mamdani-israel-us-support.txt,opinion,2025-11-27,Kenneth Roth,Zohran Mamdani is rewriting the political rules around support for Israel,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/27/zohran-mamdani-israel-us-support,"Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be quaking in his boots at the decisive victory of Zohran Mamdani in the 4 November New York City mayoral election. Not because of absurd allegations of antisemitism for which there is no evidence, but because Mamdani has broken the longstanding taboo for successful New York candidates against criticizing the Israeli government. And he has only reinforced his approach in the month since his election. New York has the largest Jewish population in the United States – and the second-largest of any city in the world after Tel Aviv. The longstanding assumption was that many Jewish voters prioritized the defense of the Israeli government over other issues, so criticism of Israel would set them against a politician. Mamdani blew that assumption out of the water. During the campaign he spoke accurately and openly about the genocide that Israel was committing in Gaza. He insisted that all residents of Israel should have equal rights. He said he would arrest Netanyahu were he to show up in New York. Yet one-third of New York’s Jewish voters cast a ballot for him. As did many others. Some Jews may have been uncomfortable with Mamdani’s criticism of Israel but liked other aspects of his candidacy, such as his relentless focus on affordability. Others, myself included, were attracted by his candor on such an important issue as Israel. Many were also probably appalled by the efforts of Mamdani’s principal opponent, Andrew Cuomo, to tar Mamdani with fact-free allegations of antisemitism. Mamdani has only continued his openness on Israel since the election. In his remarkably friendly meeting with Donald Trump in the White House on 21 November, Mamdani repeated his genocide views and noted that the US government was funding it. Trump let the comment slide without a response. After a major Manhattan synagogue hosted a group that was encouraging American Jews to emigrate not only to Israel (a normal enough appeal) but also to Israel’s settlements in the occupied West Bank, Mamdani noted the illegality of the settlements. That is an accurate reflection of article 49 of the fourth Geneva convention, which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its population to occupied territory. It is hard to overstate how unusual such comments are on the part of a successful New York City candidate. It is not as if New York candidates never criticize Israel. In March 2024, Chuck Schumer, the Jewish Senate minority leader from Brooklyn who represents New York state, gave a much commented-upon speech in which he said that although Israel has a right to defend itself, it must do so while minimizing harm to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. But his language was carefully couched – tame compared to Mamdani’s – and he refused to endorse Mamdani, even after he won the Democratic mayoral primary. Already Mamdani is attracting other progressive candidates to New York City congressional contests who are willing to criticize Israel and challenging those who don’t. By all appearances, he has broken the ice and started a trend. We shouldn’t equate New York with the US at large. It is a solidly Democratic, extraordinarily progressive city. More to the point, my experience as a longtime resident is that much of its Jewish population shares that progressivism. As I have traveled around the United States, I have noticed that smaller Jewish populations are more likely to see themselves as a vulnerable minority and hence to back Israel as a potential haven from persecution. In New York, Judaism is part of the fabric of the city. The sense of security that being a New York Jew engenders is more likely to yield an openness to honest criticism of the Israeli government. The political shift on Israel that Mamdani’s victory represents should be a wake-up call for the Netanyahu government. Its genocidal conduct in Gaza has turned Israel into a pariah state in much of the world. Even Germany briefly suspended the sale of arms that could be used in Gaza. Britain, Canada, France and Australia recognized a Palestinian state. Israel has been charged with genocide before the international court of justice, and Netanyahu and his former defense minister face war-crime charges before the international criminal court for starving and depriving Palestinian civilians. Israel today is overwhelming dependent on the military aid, arms sales, and diplomatic support of one country: the United States. That means Trump. And he reads the polls. He must see that Aipac, the reflexively pro-Israel lobby, can no longer corral Jewish votes as it once did. He must see that even his Christian evangelical base – traditionally the most reliably pro-Israel votes – is having qualms after Israel’s atrocities in Gaza. Israel’s growing unpopularity in the United States seems to be part of why Trump felt free to impose his 20-point peace plan on Netanyahu despite its failure to accede to his maximalist demands. The diminishing esteem for Israel will undoubtedly play a role again as Trump decides whether to insist on a clear pathway to a Palestinian state, as Arab leaders want. Trump will depend on them to fund Gaza’s reconstruction and to provide an international stabilization force for the territory. That support for Israel is no longer de rigueur in New York could come to mean that it is no longer obligatory in Washington either. That is good news for the rights of Palestinians. But it is bad news for the hopes of Netanyahu and his far-right allies that the US government will endlessly close its eyes as the Israeli government attempts to “solve” the Palestinian conflict through the use of genocide, forced mass deportation, or endless apartheid.

Somehow we make it work",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/28/always-on-my-phone-online-girlfriend-offline-we-make-it-work,"There are some pretty big differences between me and my girlfriend. She is from Aotearoa, I’m from Queensland. She is 10 years younger than me. She loves Marmite and loathes Vegemite; I hold the reverse and correct opinion. But probably our biggest difference is in our attitude to the internet. We are in what is called an offline/online gap relationship. She hates her phone so much. She treats it like a sometimes food, often has no idea where it is and, when she does have it, it’s not charged and has a haunted aura. In her dream world she wouldn’t have to own a phone and could just communicate via telepathy or little birds and woodland creatures passing occasional messages. Often her loved ones get in touch with her via me, and I often am messaging friends she is with to get a message to her. Her relationship to her phone is even more extreme in comparison with mine. I treat my phone as though it’s been soldered to my hand in some sort of terrible but fortunate accident. It is my miracle infant that I love playing with for hours and hours. I am almost always texting a group chat or tweeting something. I love knowing the breaking news, the pop culture gossip, what people are saying about … everything, the niche jokes that you only get if you spend too much time online finding out about things that definitely don’t concern you. I am not bragging about this or saying it’s good or normal for the human brain – but it’s me. I contain multitudes, and they are all on my phone. My girlfriend is unburdened by the discourse of the day, preferring to have her own busy interior life. She has read 57 books this year, whereas I have watched all of Selling Sunset and read countless posts about a wide variety of topics (it counts!). She brings me talk of what she’s reading, what she’s thinking, her layered emotional experience with a particular kind of paper or her new favourite pen. I bring her a story of a weird man who went viral for looking like Willy Wonka (or something). She talks about the next thing she’s making with her hands, I tell her annoying movie news and which couples have broken up. I don’t sit her down for a daily briefing, it mostly just comes up when I reference something I assume she knows about because it’s been all over the entire internet for weeks – and she looks at me with a blank face. Sometimes I do mention something on purpose. But I have a scale. For some things there is simply too much context to explain, as happened a few nights ago. I was online as all the buzz kicked off about the Vanity Fair journalist Olivia Nuzzi. If you are another offline person, Nuzzi’s ex-boyfriend published a piece that included poems he claimed were written to her by Robert F Kennedy Jr, after claims that they had an inappropriate relationship when she profiled RFK Jr for the magazine. One thing led to another in a group chat, and obviously I had to send a voice memo impression of RFK Jr saying: “I am a river. You are my canyon. I mean to flow through you.” My girlfriend was in another room not engaging in the world (crafting) and I didn’t think she could hear me. But out of the blue I heard her say, “What … are you doing?” I paused, opened my mouth, but there was just too much to explain. I knew she would never have heard the name Olivia Nuzzi, so I would have to go back several steps. Instead I just said, “Don’t worry about it.” She said OK and went happily back to what she was doing, unbothered by not knowing. I think our dynamic is good for us. The important thing is that we listen to each other, and enjoy it. I love how emotional she gets about books, how she connects to the characters, how she looks as though she is in a 4D cinema chair when a book is heating up. And I think she likes getting updates from the online world, the pop culture world, through me, a beautiful conduit. It’s also a helpful reminder for me – when I start explaining some of this out loud – that none of it really matters. She’s very offline, I’m too online and, somewhere between those two extremes, we’ve built a life that makes sense. • Rebecca Shaw is a Guardian Australia columnist"
commentisfree_2025_nov_28_congratulations-keir-starmer-survives-26bn.txt,opinion,2025-11-28,Marina Hyde,"Congratulations, everyone! Starmer survives another week, and it’s only cost us £26bn",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/28/congratulations-keir-starmer-survives-26bn,"Thanks to Labour’s incredible Black Friday deal, breaking manifesto policies is buy-one-get-one-free. As part of its all-promises-must-go drive, it’s ditching its flagship policy giving the right to claim unfair dismissal from day one of employment. Employers will now have up to six months to summarily sack workers who don’t pan out – unless they’re the government, in which case people have to wait till 2029. The employment rights bill was drawn up and championed by Angela Rayner, who resigned in September following a series of discoveries about her tax affairs. Weird to think that Rayner could easily have been in the I’m a Celebrity camp right now. The former deputy PM reportedly got pretty far along in her discussions with ITV in terms of booking a spot on the current series of the fauna-testicle-based format, and could at this very moment have been giving us her Queen Over the Water/Queen in the Jungle Shower for 80 minutes of primetime a night. But in the end, Rayner seems to have concluded – or had it concluded for her – that there wouldn’t be a way back to frontline politics if she took that particular leave of absence. Such are the sliding-doors moments in our very serious politics. Who’s to say for sure, but maybe Rayner will now be thinking that declining the ostrich anus was the right call as she does the House of Commons tearoom trial over the coming days. According to briefings, she’ll be taking soundings from the various malcontents who seemingly run the party from the backbenches, who got most of what they wanted in the budget this week, and who still see themselves as victims of something or other. Arguably, Labour backbenchers should count their blessings. Unlike most of the rest of the country, they have guaranteed jobs for the next few years, unless they sexually harass a junior staff member or whatever. And, on the parliamentary standards form book, even if they do. In recent times, employment rights for MPs seem all too frequently to have been modelled on those of medieval feudal lords. Anyway, whichever way you slice it, the government is back in a familiar place: arguing about whether it did or didn’t break a manifesto commitment, just as it has spent the past few days doing over its tax-raising budget. It is also arguing about whether or not it was lying on Monday when it insisted it wasn’t going to water the employment rights bill down, even though it was meeting business leaders and unions on that same day to discuss doing just that. First out to defend all this hokey cokey was business secretary Peter Kyle, who always comes off as a man playing a businessman in a play about business. According to Kyle, the pledge ditch doesn’t break the manifesto because “the manifesto committed us to finding compromise”. Did it though? By chance I have the document in front of me on my desk – they are always worth hanging on to, I find – and there is precisely nothing about compromise in it as far as I can see. Maybe there was a limited-edition manifesto with bonus material? Or maybe talking about all this is better than talking about our absent friend – growth. And so to Rachel Reeves’s budget. From almost the minute she took office, no one seems to have been more surprised by economic realities than the chancellor. OK – with the possible exception of the prime minister. Remember that during last year’s general election campaign, Keir Starmer went absolutely nuts at Rishi Sunak for suggesting that Labour would, in fact, need to raise taxes to pay for all the things it said it was buying. Sunak was lying, insisted the Labour leader, and had seriously breached the ministerial code by doing so. “He knew very well what he was doing,” Starmer fumed to the cameras back then. “He lied about our plans. And that is a true test of character. As we go to the polls it is important for voters to know about the character of the two individuals who want to be prime minister.” Mate, they know a lot more now. In fact, blissful ignorance is very much off the menu all round. Spool forward to the immediate aftermath of this latest budget, and Helen Miller, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said: “Before this budget, the UK was faced with lacklustre economic growth, stagnating living standards, and a dizzying array of fiscal pressures. The same is still true after this budget.” The tax burden that went up by £40bn last November went up a further £26bn this week – and the IFS was crystal clear that rises in national insurance in the budget did represent a manifesto breach. A moment for reflection in Downing Street? Not so’s you’d notice. When the Conservatives were in power, Labour could never stop talking about the IFS, refusing to even name it without prefixing it with its epithet “the trusted”. Now, strangely, it doesn’t want to talk about the IFS at all. As for what the upshot of all this will be, it was great to learn today that the budget’s apparently overriding aim – not to offend Labour backbenchers – has been judged sufficiently successful in that regard thus far to keep Starmer’s job safe till after the May elections. You’ve heard of a budget for jobs. Sadly, we can’t have that. What we seem to have had instead is a budget for job: one in particular. Unfair dismissal may be in the headlines now; fair dismissal is likely to be more of a preoccupation in the coming months.

commentisfree_2025_nov_28_david-lammy-jury-trials-justice-system.txt,opinion,2025-11-28,Simon Jenkins,David Lammy is right to slash the use of juries – it’s an open-and-shut case,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/28/david-lammy-jury-trials-justice-system,"Juries are an archaic and inefficient feature of Britain’s collapsing justice system. They survive only in some English-speaking countries as quaint relics of medieval jurisprudence. They deserve dispatch to the world of ducking, flogging, drawing and quartering. As it is, criminal courts have built up a hopeless backlog in England and Wales of almost 80,000 cases, with some hearings postponed to 2029. A surge in rape cases has led to a two-year delay, with twice the number of complainants withdrawing as five years ago. Britain’s prison population threatens to break the 100,000 barrier, or twice its size in the 1990s. These are not just convicts. A fifth of cells contain remand prisoners spending months awaiting trial. This is a parody of justice. The justice secretary, David Lammy, knows it cannot go on. He proposes that juries be confined to extreme crimes, such as rape, manslaughter and murder, with the rest defaulting to a single judge. This year, the Leveson review of the criminal courts warned of a “total system collapse”. Brian Leveson, a former judge, proposed most trials go before a judge with two magistrates in attendance. In the jury-loving US, a similar crisis has led to 98% of criminal cases now being settled informally, in out-of-court negotiations with prosecutors. This is hardly justice seen to be done. Almost no other European country uses juries, except sometimes in exceptional cases. Most use judges and examining magistrates. They treat trials as matters of possibly contested evidence, most often a matter for scientific expertise and discussion. Dramatised rituals are the preserve of Britain’s justice system. Juries have already been abandoned for civil trials – curiously so, as in matters of libel public opinion could be of some relevance. They have also been discontinued for financial trials, which frequently went far over the heads of “12 good citizens and true”. Meanwhile, most people seem unaware that the overwhelming majority of criminal cases are conducted in magistrates courts, already without juries. Even among cases that go to crown courts, only one in five are now decided by juries. Yet they occupy a ludicrous amount of time and bureaucracy. I have done jury service on three occasions and have never seen such a waste of time and money. What should take two or three hours would take two or three days. Two of our cases involved nothing more serious than grievous bodily harm, and one was a fraud that few of us understood. None needed a jury. All we knew was that a guilty verdict leading to a jail sentence would be grotesque. Going to prison is not a matter of months. For most people, its consequence is a sentence for life. In the courts, we heard arguments of extreme guilt against extreme innocence. There was little discussion of mitigation, previous records or background circumstances. Barristers often seemed ill-briefed, while solicitors sat silent, sometimes with their heads in their hands. This division of Britain’s legal profession between solicitors and barristers is as costly and archaic as are juries. The only people who love juries are barristers, fiercely defending them in the media. This is understandable, as juries are their audience and their bread and butter. Many crooks also like them because they believe juries are lenient, and it may be that in some cases a jury is more lenient than a judge. When I was recently prosecuted for driving too often over 20mph, I would love to have pleaded my case before a jury. The reality is that Britain ends up sending far more people to prison than countries without juries. England and Wales imprisons 145 of its citizens for every 100,000. Jury-free Germany imprisons 71, the Netherlands and Norway just 54. I do not believe that Britons are twice as criminal as Germans, or three times as Dutch or Norwegians. The jury-loving US imprisons 541. British crime and punishment is prison-obsessed. Not a week passes without some MP demanding long sentences for everyone from hate speakers to water board chairs. Jurisprudence is stuck in a rut and hostile to new ideas. Crime is seen not as a societal disease, requiring professional analysis and cure. There seems no scope for restorative justice or the role of rehabilitation in sentencing, as there is in Scandinavia. Discussion is over retribution and deterrence – a deterrence that is patently ineffective in areas such as cybercrime and sexual violence. The legal profession is lobbying frantically to keep its place on stage. It accuses opponents of wanting “to go back to the star chamber”. Anyone who says that should be compelled to spend a week studying justice in Norway – and join the 21st century. Now push has come to shove. The British system is broken. Justice is being denied. A professional freemasonry cannot stand in the way of reform. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_nov_28_germany-war-army-national-service-citizens-ukraine-europe.txt,opinion,2025-11-28,Mithu Sanyal,Germany raised its citizens to hate war. Now it wants us to enlist in the army – but we say no,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/28/germany-war-army-national-service-citizens-ukraine-europe,"When I was growing up, the most German sentence imaginable was: “We’ve lost two world wars and we’re proud of it.” We were so anti-military, we even gave our policemen green uniforms, to make them look more like foresters than soldiers. Now, the chancellor, Friedrich Merz, wants our army to become the strongest in Europe. I mean, what could go wrong? After we lost the second world war – or, as we prefer to say, after we were liberated by the allies – we swore “never again”: never again to war, and never again to Auschwitz. Admittedly, Germany rearmed in 1955, but just as “citizens in uniform”, not as soldiers following orders. Mind you, that didn’t mean that you could say “no” to an order; it just meant that we had conscription for most young men until 2011. If that sounds incredible, for us it was incredible that the British army, among others, fought wars all over the globe. For most of my life, the German army didn’t venture beyond our borders. Then came reunification in 1990, and during the first sitting of the all-German Bundestag, the then chancellor, Helmut Kohl, announced that we had to step up internationally: in 1994, the law was changed accordingly to allow the Bundeswehr to be deployed “out of area” again. Nonetheless, Germans remained squeamish about the idea that our soldiers might actually do what they have been trained for. So we convinced ourselves they were “only digging wells”. I kid you not: that was the standard reply to the worried pacifists of Germany, which accounts for a large proportion of people who have experienced the German education system – and heard those “never again” messages over and over. That all changed in 1999. I always try to convey to people outside Germany the seismic shift that occurred that year, when our then foreign minister Joschka Fischer declared we had to let go of “never again to war”, in order to honour “never again to Auschwitz” – because Serbia was planning what Fischer called a “new Auschwitz” in Kosovo. Invoking the Holocaust was the only way to get the German public to accept our participation in international wars again. So now we’re bringing back conscription – only we call it voluntary conscription. What could be more “Newspeak” than that? How about awarding a major peace prize, the International Peace of Westphalia award, to Nato? As it happens, Germany has just done that. Even Germany’s Protestant church has been re-evaluating its stance on war and the atom bomb this month, publishing a 149-page report, with the following conclusion: in these troubled times, “Christian pacifism is ethically not justifiable”. It is scary how fast this is moving – and some of the details are mind-boggling. In an imitation of The Hunger Games, our cabinet has proposed to let a lottery decide who will have to fight for Germany, if not enough young people join the army voluntarily. Presseclub, a popular TV current affairs programme, suggested conscription is good for you, because – wait for it – when you’re called up for national service an examiner inspects your genitals, so it’s like a free prostate cancer screening. This goes beyond merely cultivating support for remilitarisation – it’s telling the German people: we think you’re stupid, and we’ll treat you as such. Maybe we are stupid. A few months ago a prominent German feminist pointed out it was against equal rights that our sons had to go into the army. You bet it is! But then she went on to ask for conscription for our daughters as well. Feminism does not mean this kind of equal injustice for all, but liberating our sons from having to die for their country as well. And die they will, if we enter the Ukrainian war with manpower, as well as with arms exports. Patrick Sensburg, president of the Bundeswehr Reservists Association, warned that 1,000 soldiers would die or be seriously maimed every day. So is he warning against this sort of madness? No. One of his main concerns was how to replace 1,000 dead human beings each day. The solution: conscription. Now Sensburg is not only a reservist, he is also a former member of parliament with the governing CDU. So when he talks about replacing 1,000 dead boys – and maybe dead girls – daily, as if that were inevitable, he speaks from a position of proximity to power. Likewise, Chancellor Merz knows he is helping to reconstitute the national mood and set a new agenda when he says: “We are not at war. But we are no longer at peace.” So does nearly every politician and – I’m ashamed to admit – nearly every journalist in Germany. They are participating in what propaganda researchers call cognitive warfare. Advocating for pacifism does not mean abandoning Ukraine. I agree the war in Ukraine is a crime – so why aren’t we doing everything in our power to end it? Why aren’t our politicians talking about detente, 24/7? This is precisely why I oppose the reintroduction of conscription: a country that isn’t doing everything to prevent wars has lost the right to ask its citizens to participate in them. But ask we do, and the answer is overwhelming: “No”. Most Germans under 30 are against conscription – and it’s only Germans that are too old to go to war that are in favour. The German Peace Society reported a sharp uptick in interest in conscientious objection during the summer. Indeed, it has just updated its strategy: it is now advising that young people refuse conscription preventively, after the Federal Court of Justice ruled that conscientious objection is prohibited in times of war. You know what else is prohibited? Wars. Banned since 1928, when Germany signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, designed to prevent another world war. Ah.

commentisfree_2025_nov_28_jury-trials-flawed-unwieldy-justice-legal-system-david-lammy.txt,opinion,2025-11-28,Gaby Hinsliff,"Juries make baffling, flawed, human decisions. That’s why we must keep them",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/28/jury-trials-flawed-unwieldy-justice-legal-system-david-lammy,"For the sake of justice, something has to give. Everyone knows that the courts are in crisis, that we can’t go on like this. Traumatised victims can’t keep being told that the earliest available date for a trial is 2029, so they’re either going to have to live with it hanging over them for another four years or drop out. (And nor can defendants put their lives endlessly on hold, worrying that witnesses’ memories will only fade with time.) Something obviously needs to change. But the idea that the only solution is to scrap jury trials in all but the most serious cases of rape, murder and other offences with sentences longer than five years – as a leaked letter from the justice secretary, David Lammy, suggests will happen in England and Wales – should ring alarm bells nonetheless. Anyone who has sat in a courtroom for long enough, never mind on a jury, will know that it isn’t exactly 12 Angry Men out there. Members of the public obliged to dispense amateur justice have the same flaws, limitations and tendency to fall asleep in the boring bits – or, as on one memorable occasion at the Old Bailey, repeatedly ask if the hot witness is single – as the rest of us, and unlike judges they aren’t obliged to give their reasons for sometimes baffling decisions. Juries are notoriously resistant to convicting in all but the most straightforward rape trials, and expert doubts raised over Lucy Letby’s murder conviction make a strong case for removing them from cases with very complex medical evidence. All that said, however, they’re absolutely vital to justice being seen to be done. Public confidence in institutions depends, as the prime minister’s one-time legal mentor Lady Helena Kennedy KC put it this week, on public involvement in an establishment that can otherwise appear remote. Jury service is the only chance most people ever get to see the legal sausage getting made, and while the results aren’t always edifying, being excluded from the process seems even less likely to inspire confidence. Meanwhile for defendants and their families, the right to be judged by one’s peers – including people more closely resembling the person in the dock than the one in the wig – matters. Even with an increasingly diverse judiciary, juries are seen as a safeguard against racism, as Lammy himself used to argue before getting this job: 12 people riddled with competing biases may paradoxically have a better chance of collectively cancelling out each other’s assumptions and blind spots than one however highly trained to be impartial. And at the risk of sounding faintly paranoid, juries represent a safeguard against the politicisation of the courts that is not to be taken lightly in the current climate. Judges are appointed – a process much more easily hijacked by future governments of malign intent than the act of picking random names from a phone book. Perhaps it would be worth overriding all those fears if juries were the main cause of gridlock. But when only a tiny 1% of criminal cases in England and Wales actually end up in front of one, at best this feels like a cover for the real problem: public reluctance to pay for the services we want. As with NHS waiting lists and asylum seekers cooped up for years in hotels, the judicial backlog is the legacy of previous governments’ spending choices, for which this one is getting unfairly blamed. The system has gummed up thanks to the chronic underfunding of not just the courts but of other public services on which they depend. Long delays getting mobile phone data analysed or obtaining reports from probation officers and social workers before sentencing all add up, and so does the time wasted by defendants who don’t qualify for legal aid attempting to use ChatGPT to conduct their own defence. The untold side of the story meanwhile is the growing complexity of the law – usually as a result of parliament satisfying public demands for “something to be done” – and more proactive policing of complex historical sexual abuse and exploitation, otherwise known as police and prosecutors doing exactly what society is asking of them, but without the funding to see it through. Lammy’s proposals follow a review by Sir Brian Leveson KC that proposed removing defendants’ right to request a jury trial in some “either way” cases (which can go either before magistrates or crown courts); creating a new juryless division of judges and magistrates for others; and allowing a judge sitting alone to hear some of the most serious cases if either the defendant so chooses or the judge feels the complexity of the case warrants it. But as he makes clear in his report, Leveson’s terms of reference obliged him to “take account of the likely operational and financial context”, which is Whitehall-speak for: “There’s no money left, so don’t go getting ideas.” He did in good faith the job he was given, which was to find cheap ways of starting to cut the backlog and trust that eventually the cash would be forthcoming to finish the job. (Scrapping jury trials doesn’t save much money, but Leveson calculates it would free up 20% of court sitting time, allowing more cases to be heard within existing budgets.) It’s the same gamble underpinning Rachel Reeves’s budget this week – the hope that something will turn up before 2029, allowing harder choices to be avoided – with all the same potential risks and rewards. Justice delayed is, as the saying goes, justice denied. Let’s hope justice on the cheap doesn’t become justice discredited. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_nov_28_keir-starmer-labour-mr-rules-britain.txt,opinion,2025-11-28,Andy Beckett,Why Starmer’s desire to govern as ‘Mr Rules’ is bound to fail,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/28/keir-starmer-labour-mr-rules-britain,"This Labour government loves rules. Fiscal rules, stability rules, investment rules, immigration rules and rules restricting protests: this government’s first impulse, when faced with the fluidity and chaos of the modern world, is to put in boundaries and try to police them. Keir Starmer, a methodical person as well as a former director of public prosecutions, is so keen on orderliness that in 2022 his close colleague Lisa Nandy called him “Mr Rules”. There are things to be said for this approach. Many voters have been saying for at least a decade that they want politicians to exert more control over Britain’s erratic trajectory. Meanwhile the recent catastrophic administration of Boris Johnson, with its vast carelessness about Covid deaths, Brexit and immigration, still looms over our politics as a demonstration of what happens when governments have little interest in rules. As tech oligarchs, bond traders, international criminals, and digital and physical viruses increasingly prey on vulnerable people, it can be argued that a libertarian or fiscally loose government is a luxury most Britons can’t afford. And yet, so far, Labour’s politics of rules isn’t working. Last week’s immigration announcements, which “will make Britain’s settlement system by far the most controlled and selective in Europe”, according to the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood – rapidly becoming an even more severe figure than Starmer – have not lifted Labour’s dire poll ratings. This week’s tax-raising budget, which prioritised reassuring the bond markets that the government will keep to its “iron-clad” fiscal rules, also feels unlikely to dramatically improve Labour’s standing – despite the inclusion of some redistributive measures, such as a mansion tax, which may match many voters’ anti-elite mood. Although much of the financial establishment, media and electorate believe that Britain is in an economic and social crisis, the more Starmer and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, offer to restore order, the more the public seem to dislike them. Why are Mr Rules and Labour’s sober remedies so widely rejected? His and Reeves’s limits as communicators have clearly played a part. So have the damagingly regular occasions when ministers have failed to behave with rectitude themselves. Although this government’s scandals have been far smaller than those of its Tory predecessors – Angela Rayner underpaying stamp duty hardly compares to neglecting to properly organise the evacuation of Afghanistan – they have enabled Labour’s enemies to deploy a favourite and effective weapon: the claim that anyone at all leftwing is a hypocrite at heart. Rather than really considering Starmer’s programme, many voters have thus been able to stay in an almost nihilistic comfort zone, believing his government is no better than Johnson’s. There are also deeper reasons for the failure of Starmer’s emphasis on rule-making. The capacity of the British state to enforce ever more rules – for example, checking that millions of immigrants who want to be Britons have been model residents – has almost certainly been diminished by Tory austerity. Not recognising this is one of the many ways in which Labour appears to have underprepared for power. Even if the state’s ability to manage much of society can eventually be restored – and even if you think such a situation would be desirable – by then many voters may have moved on in terms of how they conceive of the government being in control. EU membership used to be the supposed source of our national instability; now it’s our porous borders (even though immigration is actually falling fast); next year, it might be multiculturalism – already a target for rising hard men of the right such as Robert Jenrick and Matthew Goodwin – or the crime rate, already being talked up by Nigel Farage. The claim that this country is in chaos is one that rightwing journalists and politicians have a vested interest in making, particularly during a Labour government, as it enables them to scapegoat groups they don’t like and demand authoritarian solutions. In this context, voter anxiety is constantly shape-shifting, and hard for even a competent, well-resourced government to address for long. During the calmest, most popular years of Tony Blair’s premiership – which seem another world now – plenty of Britons still believed that his government needed to “get a grip”, as focus groups regularly told Blair’s pessimistic public opinion guru, Philip Gould. Even more challengingly for Starmer, while many voters say they want a government in control, they are often drawn to politicians promising something else: risk, radical change or simply entertainment. Over the past decade, Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Farage and Zack Polanski have all enjoyed surges of support. Sterner, more orthodox party leaders such as Starmer, Rishi Sunak and Theresa May have often left voters cold. “In the Britain we make, we will all play by the rules,” Starmer pledged in 2022. But the disruption of politics and everyday life by digital technology, the addictive rebelliousness of populism, and the widespread, justified conviction that conventional politics is exhausted and insufficient for today’s huge crises all mean that making Britain orderly again is an old-fashioned, perhaps impossible goal. If Labour’s mood and popularity don’t improve soon, the party may decide to pursue a different project under a different leader. Under the ideologically flexible Andy Burnham, or the combative Rayner, or even Wes Streeting – currently trying to shed his reputation as a rigid Labour rightwinger – the government could conceivably reinvent itself as a less rule-fixated, more nimble administration that better fits the times. In Spain, the centre-left premier Pedro Sánchez has won three elections in a row, despite a rightwing populist upsurge, partly by presenting immigration and liberal social change as opportunities rather than threats, and partly by taboo-breaking parliamentary moves, including coalitions with the radical left. However, given the long history of Labour prioritising respectability, especially when in trouble, it’s just as likely that the government will become even more fixated on control under Mahmood or another disciplinarian. Labour has always been a complicated party, with both authoritarian and libertarian traditions, but both inside and outside Labour the severe approach is often seen as the realistic one – even when it’s clearly not working well. Labour governments, assuming that there are further ones, will always need to impose some new rules – to prevent this country lapsing back into ancient hierarchies or lurching forward into even worse forms of inequality. But if Labour is going to inspire voters again, rules are not enough. Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist"
commentisfree_2025_nov_28_nature-protection-laws-australia-acknowledges-environment-underpins-all.txt,opinion,2025-11-27,Ken Henry,Australia finally acknowledges environment underpins all else. That’s no small thing,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/28/nature-protection-laws-australia-acknowledges-environment-underpins-all,"The passage of long overdue reforms to the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act demonstrates powerfully that democratic governance is alive and well in Australia. The Australian parliament has done its job and passed 21st-century reforms that support a modern economy, enable the creation of new and sustainable jobs while promising not to destroy, but in fact improve, the health of the natural world. This is no small thing. In what are clearly dangerous times for democracies around the world, the Australian parliament has demonstrated emphatically that ambitious economic reform remains possible. And yes, I do mean “economic” reform. As in the past, courageous leadership has been rewarded with agreement. As in the past, the parliament has engaged constructively, in the national interest, rising above the debilitating personality politics and culture wars of recent years. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The winners stand to be future generations of Australians. In this instance, our elected representatives have demonstrated they understand that this is where their most weighty obligation is owed. But meeting that obligation is hard. Democracies often appear carefully designed to reward short-termism. Yet the success of a parliament can only be assessed according to what it does for the future. In the final sitting week of 2025, the Australian parliament appears to have delivered. The package of reforms to the EPBC Act fixes an ugly policy mess. The mess had been called out in several reviews, including Graeme Samuel’s review delivered more than five years ago. As I observed in an address to the National Press Club mid-year, report after report tells the same story of failure. The environment is simply not being protected. Biodiversity is not being conserved. Nature is in systemic decline. The environmental impact assessment systems embedded in the laws are simply not fit for purpose. Of particular concern, they are incapable of supporting an economy in transition to net zero. The mess of poorly constructed environmental laws has been undermining productivity. I noted that we simply cannot afford slow, opaque, duplicative and contested environmental planning decisions based on poor information, mired in administrative complexity. This week’s reforms promise to fix the mess. The reformed act will deliver a set of standards that aim to protect matters of national environmental significance. It will provide certainty for all stakeholders about impacts that must be regarded as “unacceptable” and therefore avoided. It builds integrity into the administration of the laws through the establishment of an independent, national EPA. It promises to end the absurd carveout for native forests, the landscapes that remain most richly endowed with biodiversity and healthy ecosystem functioning. And it lays the foundations for the development of regional plans that provide an opportunity for the three levels of government to work with local communities, including First Nations custodians, to design sustainable futures. Significantly, long-overdue protection will be provided for our forests. The lungs of the Earth, a lifeboat against climate change, a filter against sentiment destroying the Great Barrier Reef and a haven for wildlife will be provided real protection, while incentives will be provided to support a modern forestry industry based on plantations. And there is another thing that should be called out at this time. This may be the most important thing. For centuries, humans have believed that economic and social progress necessarily comes at the expense of the environment. We have believed that the destruction of the natural world is a price that must be paid for everything else that matters to us; as we accumulate physical and financial capital, we must run down the stock of natural capital. We have acted as if we can choose, indefinitely, to trade-off environmental integrity for material gains. Our choices have created deserts, waterways incapable of supporting life, soils leached of fertility, climate change driving weather events of such severity and frequency that whole towns, suburbs and agricultural landscapes are fast becoming uninsurable. This week’s amendments acknowledge that the state of the natural world is foundational. That without its rebuilding, future economic and social progress cannot be secured. We should think of economic and social progress as exercises in constrained optimisation. This framing is familiar to those immersed in economic policy. And yet, as I noted in the National Press Club address, economics has for the most part ignored the most important constraints on human choices. These are embedded in the immutable laws of nature. Our failure to recognise that is now undermining productivity growth and having a discernible impact on economic performance. It threatens livelihoods, even lives. Writing into law an acknowledgment that environmental protection and biodiversity conservation necessarily underpin everything else, and that they must therefore have primacy, is a profound achievement. An unprecedented bequest to future generations. Dr Ken Henry AC is a former treasury secretary and chair of the Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation"
commentisfree_2025_nov_28_nigel-farage-antisemitism-allegations-us-maga.txt,opinion,2025-11-28,Jonathan Freedland,Antisemitism allegations against the teenage Farage matter – look at what he went on to do,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/28/nigel-farage-antisemitism-allegations-us-maga,"Nigel Farage could have strangled this story at birth. Confronted with the testimony of more than 20 former schoolmates, who shared with the Guardian their memories of a young Farage taunting Jews and other minorities in the most appalling terms – telling a Jewish pupil that “Hitler was right”, singing “Gas ’em all” and making a hissing sound to simulate lethal gas – he could have said: “I have no memory of what’s been described, but such behaviour would of course have been atrocious and if I was involved in any way, I am genuinely sorry.” Sure, it would have been more of an “ifpology” than an apology, its admission of guilt wholly conditional, but it would surely have closed the story down. Reassured that the Reform UK leader had declared racist and antisemitic abuse unacceptable, most observers would have allowed that these events took place half a century ago and moved on. But that is not what Farage did. Instead, he and his party have offered shifting accounts, moving from outright denial to non-denial denial and back again. That slipperiness itself raises questions about the character of the man who, according to the polls, is on course to be Britain’s next prime minister. But this episode also points to a larger and more alarming phenomenon, one that stretches far beyond these shores. Farage’s defence rests on three pillars, each one of which is shaky. The first response has been to say the accusations are all untrue or, to put it another way, that his accusers are liars. As at least one of them has pointed out, that is itself an antisemitic trope: that Jews lie about their own suffering in pursuit of some devious, unstated end. The second line of defence insists that Farage never did these things but, if he did, it would be irrelevant because he was only a child at the time. I’ve spoken to several Jewish community officials who say this is among the reasons why, so far, they have been reluctant to join the chorus of condemnation. True, the argument is undermined somewhat by the fact that Farage’s alleged conduct spanned a six-year period, right until he was a sixth former, aged 18, but it might just hold up – were it not for a flaw in Farage’s third defence. This argues that the accusations against him lack force because they have no bearing on his politics today; that whatever the ex-pupils of Dulwich college might say about the boy of the 1970s and 1980s, the man of 2025 cannot be accused of antisemitism. Here the facts get a bit more awkward. Consider one of Farage’s comments this week, in a broadcast interview where he gave that non-denial denial. “Have I said things 50 years ago that you could interpret as being banter in a playground, you could interpret in a modern light today in some sort of way? Yes.” Perhaps Farage was admitting there to less than his accusers recall, but it sounded as if he was suggesting that songs about gassing Jews, Asians and Black people amount to no more than “banter”. That’s not schoolboy Farage talking, but the Farage of 2025. And that is far from the only mark against the fully adult politician. In 2017, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said he had “crossed the line into well-known antisemitic tropes”, after he had nodded along while a caller to his LBC show claimed that Israel had both the Republican and Democratic parties “in their pockets”. Farage replied: “In terms of money and influence they are a very powerful lobby”, explaining that “there are about six million Jewish people living in America, so as a percentage it’s quite small, but in terms of influence it’s quite big”. Three years later, the Board of Deputies again denounced the then Brexit party leader for trading “in dog whistles and tropes”, after he had repeatedly deployed words and motifs that are staples of far-right antisemitic conspiracy theory. In that period, Farage was ticking off almost every item on the trope bingo card, railing against “globalists”, “cultural Marxists”, Goldman Sachs and George Soros, the latter a perennial hate figure to those who allege a secret Jewish plot to undermine nation states in pursuit of global government. In a 2020 article for Newsweek, Farage aimed his fire at “unelected globalists shaping the public’s lives based on secret recommendations from the big banks”. The Community Security Trust, or CST, the organisation that monitors and combats antisemitism in the UK, lambasted Farage at the time for using “language that evokes antisemitic conspiracy codewords”, warning that “this search for scapegoats will keep requiring new enemies and new excuses, moving the national debate into more polarising and dangerous places”. There was particular disquiet at the company Farage was keeping, cheerfully sitting alongside the notorious Alex Jones of Infowars, for example, as the pair played some of the greatest hits of antisemitic conspiracy theory, from the Bilderberg group to “new world order”. Farage was no less happy to be interviewed at least six times by Rick Wiles, a far-right US pastor who would later brand the impeachment of Donald Trump a “Jew coup”. Which brings us to that larger phenomenon. Talk to the CST today and it is clear that the most urgent, direct threat to Jewish safety is violent jihadism, of the kind that saw Jihad al-Shamie launch a deadly attack on Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester last month. But what it sees as a growing long-term danger is a shift now under way on the US right. The fear, as CST policy director Dave Rich puts it, is that “Nick Fuentes becomes the face of the Republican movement” – Fuentes being the unabashed white supremacist and Holocaust denier who once dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and who, some warn, is poised to replace Charlie Kirk as the darling of the next Republican generation. Dispensing with the previous posture in which rightwing politicians deflected accusations of antisemitism by boasting of their pro-Israel credentials – even if their support for Israel amounted to no more than taking sides in what they saw as a battle of the west against Islam – Fuentes, Tucker Carlson and others are moving into a new place. No longer speaking of “Judeo-Christian values”, but espousing instead an aggressive Christian nationalism, they are increasingly hostile to Israel and Zionism, and seemingly motivated not by sympathy for the Palestinians, but rather by an updated version of the 1930s, America First view that suspected a Jewish plot to drag America to war. Given the global might of the US, such a change to the American right would have a profound effect on Jews the world over. All of which is a long way from the playground of Dulwich college. But perhaps it explains why Nigel Farage’s youth is not quite as irrelevant as he would have us believe. Because the past has a nasty habit of intruding into the present – and future.

Don’t think it can’t happen here,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/28/press-freedom-is-being-destroyed-from-gaza-to-america-dont-think-it-cant-happen-here,"First things first. It would be remiss of me not to refer specifically to the appalling and outrageous casualty list of Palestinian journalists and other media workers in Israel’s war on Gaza since the brutal attack by Hamas on Israeli citizens two years ago. Having excluded independent global media access inside Gaza, leaving us all to rely on local journalists to bear witness to the devastating effect of Israel’s bombardment on the civilian population of Gaza and the famine that has accompanied it, Israel has failed dismally to explain with any credibility why so many journalists have been killed. Importantly, what we should acknowledge is the impact those Palestinian journalists have had in return for their sacrifice. They have confronted the world with powerful evidence that has gradually taken on the look and feel of genocide in real time – in our living rooms as well as the corridors of the UN and its agencies. It is significantly due to the courage and stubborn determination of those journalists that no reasonable citizen of the world has been able to look away. In a world that is becoming more and more ill-liberal, including now the most powerful democracy of all, the message is becoming stark for our own country. When the president of the United States sits in the White House with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, as he did a week ago, and seeks to dismiss the brutal murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalist and Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi by agents of the Saudi government as: “things happen” – THINGS HAPPEN – and castigates the journalist who dares to ask the Crown Prince about it, it illuminates just how far the ground has shifted for journalism in the United States. All those massive lawsuits against mainstream media outlets Donald Trump regards as the enemy, that are designed to intimidate against continuing to chronicle his alarming demolition job on the institutions that underpin democracy in America, are testament to the clear and present danger for a strong, free, effective and independent media everywhere. And don’t kid yourself it can’t happen here. On this night six years ago, as chair of the Walkley Foundation, I highlighted a rare unity of purpose within our industry called the Right to Know coalition to pressure the Morrison government to strengthen press freedom in Australia after separate federal police raids on the ABC’s Sydney headquarters and journalist Annika Smethurst’s home in Canberra. Nine days later, December 7, 2019, Anthony Albanese, as opposition leader, attacked the Morrison government for its failure to support press freedom, in which he referred to the raids as reflecting “something sinister”. There have been two parliamentary inquiries into press freedom since then, with some 30 recommendations for reform, and Albanese has now been prime minister for three-and-a-half years, but still raids like those on both the ABC and Smethurst could happen again, with a not terribly robust hurdle to jump. In his 2019 speech, Albanese declared “journalism is not a crime. It’s essential to preserving our democracy.” One test of his resolve would be to deliver uniform national shield laws to allow journalists to protect their sources without the threat of imprisonment. But today, although there are shield laws of one sort or another in place in every state as well as nationally, the overall framework has been likened to Swiss cheese, and despite ongoing appeals there’s no obvious sign of a process to harmonise shield laws. In 2019, Albanese said, “We don’t need a culture of secrecy. We need a culture of disclosure.” Well, in 2023, his government’s own formal review put the number of secrecy provisions in commonwealth law at 875. Two years later, there are more, not fewer secrecy offences. Not a good sign. “Protect whistleblowers,” Albanese said in 2019. “Expand their protections and the public interest test.” We’re waiting on the government’s revised whistleblower reforms to be tabled in parliament, and if it’s still wedded to the establishment of a whistleblower ombudsman, rather than a strong independent whistleblower protection authority casting a wider net, then we should be seriously disappointed that the government has fallen short of the expectation Albanese raised six years ago. The lives of whistleblowers, David McBride and Richard Boyle, were upended because they were courageous enough to blow the whistle, in one case, on war crimes in Afghanistan, and the other, on indefensible debt collections on behalf of the tax office. One big test of this government’s credibility will be whether a McBride or a Boyle would still face jail in the future under the new laws. Right now, that’s still possible. If these things are not in the public interest, what on earth is? “Reform freedom of information laws so they can’t be flouted by government,” Albanese said in 2019. But we’re told his proposed new freedom of information laws will have the opposite effect. So on reflection, this government’s scorecard against the benchmarks Albanese set in 2019 as opposition leader is mixed. He’s certainly talked the talk, and to a degree he’s walked the walk, but given what’s at stake now – and I haven’t even mentioned where AI is going to take us even five years from now – we as an industry cannot afford to lose sight of important unfinished business. And in that regard, where is the Right to Know coalition now? The one that united our industry six years ago? Our broad challenges are growing, not lessening. In September, the remarkable Filipino-American journalist Maria Ressa addressed our National Press Club. Her shared Nobel peace prize in 2021 – in her case, for safeguarding freedom of expression in the Philippines, particularly during the authoritarian reign of Rodrigo Duterte – brings compelling authority to the warning note she sounded directly to Australia. Ressa contends that: “The greatest threat we face today isn’t any individual leader or one government. It’s the technology that’s amplifying authoritarian tactics worldwide enabled by democratic governments that abdicated their responsibility to protect the public … Tech platforms have become weapons of mass destruction to democracy.” If you haven’t seen her speech, do so, as a priority. She commends Australia for taking on the digital giants with a world-first social media ban for children under 16 but says it was a mistake for the government to abandon its proposed law to tackle disinformation on digital platforms last year. We’ve caught the world’s attention on this. Let’s not stop there. No one, including Ressa, is saying it’s easy. But we all have to be invested in this. Let’s not allow ourselves to get intimidated or derailed by those who would seek to distort the concept of freedom of speech for money and power. After all my decades in journalism I have an unshakable belief in an unquenchable public hunger for news that informs, that feeds our curiosity and fires our imaginations; that stimulates crucial debate and can be trusted. That hunger is not just going to evaporate. And if we think we’re doing it tough trying to cut through the shroud of institutional secrecy, or trying to call out those who would polarise our communities for grubby political ends, remind yourself of those journalists in Gaza or Ukraine, or Russia or China, or Myanmar or Afghanistan who’ve been shut down or gone to prison, or gone to their graves for an ideal – for seeking to report the truth. We are all one community of journalists and there’s something powerful we can harness in that, that we should never lose sight of. That’s really why we’re here tonight. Thank you.

commentisfree_2025_nov_28_the-guardian-view-on-turner-and-constable-radical-in-different-ways.txt,opinion,2025-11-28,Editorial,The Guardian view on Turner and Constable: radical in different ways,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/28/the-guardian-view-on-turner-and-constable-radical-in-different-ways,"JMW Turner appears on £20 notes and gives his name to Britain’s most avant garde contemporary art prize. John Constable’s work adorns countless mugs and jigsaws. Both are emblematic English artists, but in the popular imagination, Turner is perceived as daring and dazzling, Constable as nice but a little bit dull. In a Radio 4 poll to find the nation’s favourite painting, Turner’s The Fighting Temeraire – which even features in the James Bond film Skyfall – won. Constable’s The Hay Wain came second. Born only a year later, Constable was always playing catch-up: Turner became a member of the Royal Academy at 27, while Constable had to wait until he was 52. To mark the 250th anniversary of their births, Tate Britain is putting on the first major exhibition to display the two titans head to head. Shakespeare and Marlowe, Mozart and Salieri, Van Gogh and Gauguin – creative rivalries are the stuff of biopics. Mike Leigh’s 2014 film shows Turner (Timothy Spall) adding a touch of red to his seascape Helvoetsluys to upstage Constable’s The Opening of Waterloo Bridge at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1832. Critics delighted in dubbing them “Fire and Water”. The enthralling new Tate show is billed as a battle of rivals, but it also tells another story. Constable’s paintings might not have the exciting steam trains, boats and burning Houses of Parliament of Turner’s, but they were radical too. Painting mill workers and bargemen was groundbreaking at a time when grandiose classical themes – favoured by Turner – were de rigueur. Like Jane Austen (whose 250th anniversary was celebrated this year), Constable is often accused of ignoring the external world and harsh realities of 18th-century rural life. But his bucolic scenes redefined what a painting could be. Echoing Wordsworth’s Romantic manifesto in the Lyrical Ballads (1800) that poets should take “incidents and situations from common life”, Constable wrote in 1832 that his art “is to be found under every hedge, and in every lane, and therefore nobody thinks it worth picking up”. Today, Constable’s spirit can be found in the council estates and abandoned garages of the Coventry artist George Shaw, as well as the hedges and lanes of David Hockney’s late paintings of his beloved Yorkshire Wolds. Every age has found new meanings and inspiration in Constable and Turner. They can still cause a stir. Turner’s abolitionist 1840 Slave Ship – believed to have been inspired by the Zong massacre, in which more than 130 enslaved people were thrown overboard by the British captain for the insurance money – has been reworked by the poet David Dabydeen and the installation artist Sondra Perry to give a black perspective. In 1980, Constable was weaponised in Peter Kennard’s Haywain with Cruise Missiles as a protest against US nuclear weapons being based in the English countryside – a cold-war riposte to the biscuit-tin nostalgia. The climate emergency gives a renewed urgency to their work. Their influence can be seen in the cracking icebergs and crumbling coastlines of Emma Stibbon’s paintings and the elemental installations of Olafur Eliasson. A terrible storm at sea or dark clouds over Salisbury Cathedral – Turner and Constable captured not just moments in time but the spirit of their age. In recording technological innovation, political upheaval, inequality, the shadows of war, and a rapidly changing natural environment, the work of both artists resonates with our own era. Displaying them side by side encourages us to see such familiar paintings in a whole new light. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the government paper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a foreign policy scholar close to Vladimir Putin’s regime bluntly observed: “As long as hostilities continue, leverage remains. As soon as they cease, Russia finds itself alone (we harbour no illusions) in the face of coordinated political and diplomatic pressure.” Mr Putin has no interest in a ceasefire followed by talks where Ukraine’s rights as a sovereign nation would be defended and reasserted. He seeks the capitulation and reabsorption of Russia’s neighbour into Moscow’s orbit. Whether that is achieved through battlefield attrition, or through a Trump-backed deal imposed on Ukraine, is a matter of relative indifference. On Thursday, the Russian president reiterated his demand that Ukraine surrender further territory in its east, adding that the alternative would be to lose it through “force of arms”. Once again, he described Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government as “illegitimate”, and questioned the legally binding nature of any future agreement. The simultaneous assertion that a peace plan discussed by the US and Ukraine this week could “be the basis for future agreements” is therefore as bogus as Mr Putin’s empty praise for Mr Trump’s previous diplomatic efforts. The plan – which emerged as a counter to White House proposals effectively copied and pasted from a Kremlin wishlist – reportedly calls for an end to the fighting as a precondition for talks over territory. This is precisely the route that the Kremlin remains determined to resist. News that Mr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has resigned after being placed under investigation by anti-corruption authorities – a damaging development that could scarcely come at a worse moment for Ukraine’s president – makes it still less likely that Mr Putin will be persuaded to make concessions he has never before contemplated. Mr Trump is being strung along again. But the clear and present danger is that a combination of “peacemaker-in-chief” presidential vanity, a desire to do business with Russia and Mr Zelenskyy’s sudden political vulnerability will tempt him to do Mr Putin’s dirty work for him. After four years of resistance, sacrifice and suffering, Ukraine must not be bullied into a cynical carve-up, which would leave it permanently vulnerable to Russia’s aggression, jeopardise Europe’s future security and inspire authoritarian regimes worldwide. Responsibility for ensuring this does not happen lies with Europe. Though Russian forces continue to make small, incremental gains in Ukraine’s east, their advance is painfully slow and at enormous cost. By signalling a commitment to provide Kyiv with sufficient financial and military resources to resist in the medium term, European leaders can begin to alter the dynamic of negotiations in the present. Whether such aid is to come through a “reparations loan” underwritten by frozen Russian assets, from the EU budget, or via common borrowing by member states, must be resolved quickly after months of delay. A signal needs to be sent to both Mr Putin and Mr Trump that Europe will resolutely defend Ukraine’s right to a just peace. As the Kremlin seeks leverage via the killing fields of eastern Ukraine and within the corridors of the White House, Mr Zelenskyy must urgently be given some of his own.

commentisfree_2025_nov_29_chicago-ice-oppression-us-community-immigration-raid.txt,opinion,2025-11-29,Zoe Williams,What Chicago’s fight against ICE can teach us all about how to resist oppression,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/29/chicago-ice-oppression-us-community-immigration-raid,"Earlier this year, the Trump administration reversed the convention that nobody would be snatched by immigration and customs enforcement, or ICE, by a school, church or hospital. Since then, teachers have reported classrooms a third empty, as parents are too scared to send their kids in – volunteers walk them there and back. In the Rogers Park area of Chicago, a group of citizens are organising to resist such immigration raids. Sometimes, it’s simple non-violent tactics, such as slowing officers down by walking in front of them. Last month, 50 people rushed to a church, where the congregation was trapped, having got word that there were ICE agents waiting outside. Maybe their most evocative tactic is whistles – coded blasts for when a convoy is suspected to be ICE agents, a different code when it’s confirmed. They have numerous accounts of undocumented migrants warned off driving right into a raid, which is galvanising, but they also see and hear dismaying things all the time: vehicles standing empty, one door open, not robbed, merely relieved of their drivers; landscape gardeners arrested off ladders. Earlier this month, the Protect Rogers Park group got 1,500 calls in a day. This isn’t unusual; people don’t like it when their neighbours are disappeared. Similar stories could be told about Kenmore Street, Glasgow, or Peckham, in London, where neighbours surrounded Home Office vans until they were forced to release their cargo and head home. But I only know about Rogers Park from Criminal, a true-crime podcast. It’s been running for more than a decade, and covers crimes that range from the macabre to the peculiar – always introduced with the same disconcerting intonation, the host announcing “I’m Phoebe Judge” with the kind of pride and pizzazz you might use for “I’m Mr Invisible”. But who, in this episode, is the criminal? It’s plain from the start that she is not talking about the whistleblowers, and yet it still takes a while for your brain to catch up: she has got to mean the federal government. This is a huge thing to imply, only secondarily because Trump is notoriously litigious, particularly against media organisations. First and foremost, it’s a terrifying thing to articulate: if your government is breaking the law, what do laws mean? Can any be relied upon once some are breached? How do you tell the difference between living in such a society and hiding in it? In this, and a number of other episodes, Criminal is forensic, sober, but also quite unusual: a norm has settled over the reporting of ICE, where all the facts are laid out – raw numbers, painful details, the state of detention centres – except the central one, that people are being kidnapped. Hannah Arendt discussed the term Gleichschaltung, roughly translatable as “coordination” or “synchronisation”. It came from the Nazi justice minister Franz Gürtner to mean, broadly, that all political, social, cultural and civic institutions had to fall in line with the totalitarian state. Such a thing can only be achieved with the complicity of everyone: the minute-by-minute decisions of people who will do anything, personally or professionally, to stay with the majority. It might mean turning a blind eye to unacceptable state actions, or it might mean insisting, with the logic of your arguments, that things are still the same when they plainly are not. This is the trap many Democrats are currently in – they produce pie charts to show that the majority of immigrants snatched off the streets are not criminals, but they do not say that to detain 65,000 people is an authoritarian act. And this is partly a boiling-frog effect: ICE has been in existence since 2003, introduced by George W Bush after 9/11; Barack Obama was no stranger to deportations; that uptick of detainees may break records, and the sheer activity of ICE across the US is running communities ragged, but there were nearly 40,000 migrants in detention when Donald Trump took office in January. Nobody gets a memo when democracy tips into something else. But it’s not all avoidance: most people prefer to synchronise, to stick with the majority. The anthropologist Michael Maccoby, writing in The Leaders We Need almost 20 years ago, drew on the research of Erich Fromm from 1930s Germany, and summarised quite bluntly that, as Fromm predicted, only about 15% of people resisted nazism. It wasn’t because they were fervent supporters, or even, at the outset, because they were scared, but because that’s where the herd was. The US is currently trying to export its anti-migrant agenda. The New York Times reported on a bizarre set of documents in which Marco Rubio tells diplomats in Europe to “regularly engage host governments … to raise US concerns about violent crimes associated with people of a migration background”. Bizarre as that is, it’s not why the story of Rogers Park, and the storytelling of Protect Rogers Park, is universally relevant. Don’t wait until your government is so racist that it’s lifting people off ladders while they are trying to work, or seizing kids as they are trying to get to school, before you protest. Every time you hear aggressive xenophobia and racist insinuation from those in power and check in with how it polled before you say it’s disgusting, you are building the herd that will suffocate opposition when it matters. In an event this autumn, Olly Knowles from Led By Donkeys said “The time to fight fascism isn’t five to midnight”, going on to say that he didn’t think we were at five to midnight in the UK. Someone in the audience said “What time is it?”, and it was funny because, really, who can say? It’s quite impressionistic, this metaphor, it’s not what you would call digital. But it’s the question to ask with each fresh wave of anti-migrant policy, and rhetoric, and kite-flying, and debate: what time does that make it? Because five to midnight is too late.

commentisfree_2025_nov_29_marriage-women-men-survey-data-girls.txt,opinion,2025-11-29,Naoise Dolan,What could be putting young women off marriage? It really isn’t that much of a mystery,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/29/marriage-women-men-survey-data-girls,"According to recent data, marriages in England and Wales are down by nearly 9% after a post-pandemic spike, while civil partnerships have risen by almost the same percentage. This downward trend is also reflected in the US. The Vatican has piped up in defence of the institution, releasing a 40-page doctrinal note, Una Caro (One Flesh): In Praise of Monogamy: Doctrinal Note on the Value of Marriage as an Exclusive Union and Mutual Belonging. Sworn celibates would not be my personal first port of call when seeking relationship advice, but to each their own – exclusively and indissolubly, if the Catholic church is to be believed. Among the younger crowd, gendered expectations about marriage are changing, at least according to a survey by the University of Michigan, which found that only 61% of high-school girls want to be married one day, compared to 74% of the boys. Perhaps this is behind the burgeoning genre of opinion pieces in which a rightwing man complains that women don’t want to date him. Often enough, he is an avowed libertarian, leaving it a mystery why he does not simply accept the workings of the free market. But what could be putting young girls, and women, off marriage? Well, for women who date men, perhaps it’s the fact that this is what some men’s expectations look like: “At least 20 years younger”, “good breeder”, “taller than 5ft 6in and can’t be a Scorpio”, says 79-year-old baronet Benjamin Slade, who is (in the manner of these things) in want of a wife. I will admit to having been momentarily impressed that this would-be husband knows about astrology, all the more so by his swift conversion of it into a new and exciting way to hate women. But with my rising Scorpio, 5ft 3in stature and hips better adapted to bearing a vintage bumbag than a child, I am presumably out of the running to wed him – as are you, dear reader, since the desired candidate cannot “read the Guardian newspaper”. One potential reason for the decline of marriage occurs quite early in the pipeline: fewer people are entering the committed relationships that tend to be a prerequisite, barring impulsive antics in Vegas. According to YouGov data, half of 18- to 34-year-old Americans have been in a “situationship”, defined in the Cambridge Dictionary as “a romantic relationship between two people who do not yet consider themselves a couple but who have more than a friendship”. A central feature of such arrangements is that only one party tends to consider it a “yet”. There are also more fundamental objections to the institution itself. For me, marriage is a form of state authority and coercion that I will not endorse through my participation. Governments use tax breaks, hospital visitation rights and other financial and legal incentives to enforce their chosen relationship structures above others: non-monogamy, communal living and other non-traditional arrangements are sidelined. I do not wish to judge anyone else for marrying, whether they do it wholeheartedly or simply pragmatically – that’s none of my business. But in terms of giving pen-pushing bureaucrats the power to legislate my own private life, it’s a no from me. My view is not universal. “People Still Want to Marry. Why Aren’t They?” asked a New York Times podcast last month. One explanation offered is that marriage is now considered a “capstone”, not a start, to adulthood: there is increased social pressure to have your finances, career and long-term living arrangements firmly settled before tying the knot, in an atmosphere where employment is becoming ever more precarious and accommodation ever less affordable. For some, marriage is also still a life event that necessarily precedes having children; but many young women will have seen where caring responsibilities fell during the Covid pandemic, and must surely be concluding that the burdens that would be placed on them as parents are impossible. The optimistic spin is that rather than being cut off from marriage, we’re not being forced into it any more. Nobody who truly believes in the institution should want sceptics like me entering it, anyway. Perhaps the world ahead of us is one where the only people getting married are those who fully want to. That sounds like a happily ever after to me. Naoise Dolan is an Irish writer and the author of Exciting Times and The Happy Couple Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

commentisfree_2025_nov_29_rosa-parks-resistance-today.txt,opinion,2025-11-29,Jan-Werner Müller,What Rosa Parks can teach us about resistance today,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/29/rosa-parks-resistance-today,"It was 70 years ago when four African Americans were sitting in the fifth row of a bus in Montgomery. As one white man had to stand towards the front, the driver asked the four to get up and move towards the back of the bus. Three did; one did not – the rest is history. Or so many American kids might think when they first read the story of Rosa Parks in school. It is a story of courage, but, lest one forget, it is also a story about breaking the law. And the question for us today is what civil disobedience means in an era when the federal government is signaling its readiness severely to punish even perfectly legal dissent. Before getting into any arguments about how disobedience can end up strengthening democracy, it is worth reminding ourselves that the textbook version of Parks is usually not the whole story. She was not just a fatigued seamstress who, after a long day, at work, spontaneously decided to protest against injustice. Rather, Parks had been a member of the NAACP in Montgomery since 1943; she had led the organization’s youth, and she had been investigating rapes of African American women in Alabama. What Obama once claimed – “that any of us ordinary people without rank or wealth or title or fame can somehow point out the imperfections of this nation, and come together, and challenge the status quo, and decide that it is in our power to remake this country that we love until it more closely aligns with our highest ideals” – is true, but it is not the whole truth: Parks had no rank or wealth, but she had plenty of fellow activists and friends. Resistance is a matter of coordination, and coordination is helped by having an effective organization behind you. The bus boycott – which lasted a staggering 381 days – depended on organizers quickly distributing pamphlets in the Black community and on volunteers running “private taxis” (the US supreme court ruled segregation of buses unconstitutional in December 1956). Parks went on record saying: “The only tired I was, was tired of giving in.” Others were tired of it, too, but had the energy and courage to organize. What the political theorist Brandon Terry has called “our culture’s compulsive references to the civil rights movement” and, more particularly, “the apparent concord of civil rights celebration” overlook that non-violent protest against injustice was hardly popular among whites across the country. It is something Trump’s court historians, starting with the ill-fated 1776 Commission, tend to leave out of their narratives; they make it seem like the entire nation loved coming together around the idea of “color-blindness” in the 1960s – and it was the only the crazy leftist proponents of identity politics who undermined that happy consensus. Civil disobedience is a “public, nonviolent, conscientious yet political act”, according to what remains its most influential definition, put forward by the towering figure in political philosophy of the second half of the 20th century, John Rawls. There are reasons to think that Rawls’s approach has become objectively more difficult to implement today. Rawls had claimed that breaking the law to point to an injustice could convince majorities to bring about change. But he was relying on a media system that allowed majorities to see injustice – think of the vicious attacks by policemen (and their dogs) on civil rights protesters in Birmingham. While information is more accessibly today – and Black Lives Matter crucially depended on acts of police brutality going viral – our media landscape is also much more fragmented, with plenty of rightwingers making sure that events are reframed, which is a polite way of seeing: making sure their meaning is distorted. Rawls also relied on the notion that, in an “almost just” society, disobedience should involve being willing to accept punishment – as a demonstration of one’s overall “fidelity” to the law (which would also make it harder to have one’s conduct be portrayed as anarchism or worse). Of course, there is a general question as to whether one considers the US “nearly just”; but, more particularly, there is the evident tendency by the Trump administration to undermine the rule of law. The attorney general has seemingly given up on any independence from the executive, racing to follow Trump’s commands to exert retribution on his supposed enemies. As members of the Department of Justice have reported, the idea is no longer that cases are brought after fact-finding; rather, cases are constructed and then the race is on to find facts that might fit. There is valiant pushback by some judges; but the structural damage and corruption have been enormous already. Rawls thought of civil disobedience as a form of “public speech”. It is unclear whether that speech will be heard. Even if it is, one might doubt whether it will get a good-faith hearing by the authorities. The philosopher had assumed that “in a state of near justice, vindictive repression of legitimate dissent is unlikely”. Today, dissent both legitimate and legal is already being targeted by Trumpists and the president himself (threatening most recently to go after citizens who, to his mind, are disturbing “domestic tranquility”). Anyone contemplating civil disobedience must have answers to challenges which, for all the injustices of the south, “the mother of the civil rights movement” did not have to face in quite the same way."
commentisfree_2025_nov_29_russia-ukraine-peace-deal.txt,opinion,2025-11-29,Stephen Wertheim,The Russia-Ukraine peace deal is not a loss. Nor is it a victory,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/29/russia-ukraine-peace-deal,"No one should be satisfied with the unjust peace that Ukraine may be forced to accept. The aggressor would be rewarded with territory and other concessions from the victim it has brutalized. Yet the horrified reaction in Washington to recent peace proposals is troubling in its own right. The Trump administration’s recent 28-point plan, roundly denounced in Congress and the commentariat as a “capitulation” to Moscow, actually offered Kyiv a remarkable strategic outcome. Under its terms, Ukraine would face no meaningful limit on its peacetime military, despite Russian attempts to impose draconian restrictions since 2022. (The only requirement, a cap of 600,000 personnel, probably exceeds the number of active-duty forces Ukraine would maintain anyway.) Moreover, Ukraine would receive a substantial security guarantee from the United States and Europe – the strongest in history, even if short of a Nato-style commitment. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, launched his invasion to break Ukraine’s alignment with the west and against Moscow. When the fighting stops, Ukraine will be militarily stronger, more hostile to Russia and better protected than ever before. Yet it is already clear that this outcome, if and when it may be realized, will be deemed unacceptable and immoral by powerful voices in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. Continuing the war indefinitely is highly likely to leave Ukraine worse off – smaller, weaker and even more devastated – but that won’t keep senators such as Mitch McConnell or Jeanne Shaheen from railing against a least-bad compromise. It is easy to call for ideal outcomes when one is thousands of miles away and pays no price for sounding morally superior. Ukraine risks becoming the latest victim of the US’s chronic inability to see the outcomes of its wars for what they are. In prior conflicts, the US has repeatedly refused to “take the win” or accept that it could not attain everything it sought. Instead, the country has become consumed with its failure to achieve absolute victory or perfect justice, and taken destructive actions as a result. It should not make the same mistake now. In prior wars, the US has struggled both to accept loss and to accept victory – two distinct manifestations of the pursuit of ideal solutions, each relevant to Ukraine’s war today. The United States has several times allowed faltering military campaigns to drag on unnecessarily for years, not because presidents believed they could pull out a win but because they wanted to avoid taking the loss. In Vietnam, Richard Nixon chased “peace with honor” by continuing to fight for four years after taking office, before finally signing peace accords in 1973. He secretly bombed Cambodia and Laos, devastating both countries, merely to delay America’s inevitable defeat. Nixon purchased a “decent interval” between America’s withdrawal and North Vietnam’s victory with enormous quantities of blood. Similarly, one decade into the war in Afghanistan, Barack Obama recognized that the Taliban would not be militarily defeated. Yet he made minimal attempts to negotiate a power-sharing arrangement that might have ended the war and preserved, in part, the US-backed government in Kabul. The United States drew down but fought on and steadily lost ground for another decade. Unable to win yet unwilling to compromise, the United States left itself no choice but to withdraw unconditionally. When it did so, the Taliban swept back to power across the country. Armchair warriors in Washington bemoaned the absence of a “decent interval” despite the indecency of their complaint: more war would only have cost more American and Afghan lives. Failing to accept losses, the United States has also, and no less damagingly, failed to accept its own wins. In 1991, under George HW Bush, the United States decisively achieved its primary aim of ejecting Iraq’s forces from Kuwait. Having proved able to reverse Iraqi aggression, the United States could have pulled back from the Persian Gulf, knowing it could return if Saddam Hussein attempted another invasion. Instead, Washington dreamed bigger. Bush called on Iraqis to “take matters into their own hands” and force Saddam from power. He thus defied America simply by surviving, and Americans concluded that their mission remained unaccomplished. The United States proceeded to “contain” Iraq through routine bombings and the first-ever open-ended deployment of tens of thousands of soldiers in the region. After 9/11, the next Bush administration decided to finish the country’s unfinished business in Baghdad, to disastrous effect. The United States squandered its original achievement in the quest for total triumph. These precedents matter in equal measure for the war in Ukraine today. The conflict is neither a clearcut defeat nor a feelgood victory, but an in-between outcome that contains profound elements of each. Ukraine has achieved astonishing successes that must be retained. It has also suffered immense losses that will not be redeemed. Ending the war requires coming to terms with both sides of that mixed verdict. On the one hand, like the US-backed governments in Saigon and Kabul, the government in Kyiv will not achieve a total battlefield victory, and it is fantastical to believe that Ukraine could do so. Even the Biden administration, despite sometimes framing the stakes of the conflict in absolutist terms, never really expected Ukraine to liberate all its territory by force. The best that can be achieved is a compromise settlement that gives Ukraine a viable chance at peace and security while allowing Russia to reap strategic and territorial gains. If this feels like a dirty deal, like some measure of appeasement, that’s because it is. But if there is no better alternative, it will be a dirty deal worth making. On the other hand, the United States and Ukraine are struggling to internalize the enormous achievement they have already attained. Nearly four years after Russia expected to overrun its opponent in four days, Ukraine still stands. The vast majority of its people and its land remain intact. Russia, meanwhile, has suffered mightily for its botched invasion, enduring upwards of 600,000 casualties – roughly 10 times the number of Soviet casualties suffered over a decade in Afghanistan – for what look to be modest gains. Ukraine has proved, as few believed before 2022, that it can impose severe costs on its enemy. If it can rebuild and retain a strong military with western help, it stands a fair chance of deterring another war once this one ends. That is a win worth taking. It may not, it is true, satisfy those in Washington or Kyiv who seek to escape all insecurity through Nato membership or a similar pledge from Ukraine’s allies to take up arms automatically in its cause. But total security is not available for Ukraine, or any country. Even if Nato admitted Ukraine, as it will not do, the alliance would provide no genuine guarantee of safety. Whatever they may pledge on paper, countries that have declined to fight for Ukraine to date are unlikely to go to war for it in the future. The last four years have shown both the lengths and the limits to which Ukraine’s partners will go. Fortunately, Ukraine does not require a geopolitical deus ex machina to survive. It needs itself, and the external support it can realistically receive. Still less does the United States, an ocean away, need a miracle to occur in Ukraine. Misplaced moralism is no reason to risk all that has been accomplished to date.

commentisfree_2025_nov_29_trump-insulting-female-journalists.txt,opinion,2025-11-29,Arwa Mahdawi,Trump keeps insulting female journalists,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/29/trump-insulting-female-journalists,"There was a time when it would have been a scandal for the president of the United States to call a journalist “ugly” or a politician “retarded”. Now it’s just another day in America. During a holiday when many Americans were gathering with family and reflecting on what they were grateful for, Trump was crouched over his keyboard slinging insults at his perceived enemies. On Thanksgiving day, for example, Trump posted a rant on Truth Social about immigration. He called Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, an ableist slur, and then made an Islamophobic jab at “the worst ‘Congressman/woman’ in our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab”. It was a busy Thanksgiving for Trump, who also insulted a female journalist who was asking him about the suspect in Wednesday’s attack on two national guard members in Washington DC. “Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person?” the president demanded. You don’t have to be a particularly perceptive person to know that Trump loathes most journalists – particularly women. The misogynist-in-chief has a well-documented history of lashing out at women who dare challenge him. Still, even by his own low standards, the past few weeks have been remarkable. The president seems to be on a rage-filled downward spiral, and is taking much of his aggression out on female members of the media. On Wednesday, for example, a day before his “are you stupid?” comments, Trump fumed online about the New York Times, which had just published a report on how the 79-year-old is increasingly showing his age. The piece, written by Katie Rogers and Dylan Freedman, noted that the president “keeps a shorter public schedule than he used to” and has been caught dozing off. Trump did not namecheck the male co-author in his Truth Social post, zeroing in on Rogers instead. “The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,” the president wrote. Earlier this month, Trump also called Mary Bruce of ABC News “a terrible person” after she had the temerity to ask his pal Mohammed bin Salman, the visiting Saudi crown prince, about the killing of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Prince Mohammed, who is sometimes known as Mr Bone Saw, has denied involvement in Khashoggi’s killing but a 2021 US intelligence report found the crown prince approved the brutal murder. In the same week he attacked Bruce, Trump jabbed his finger at Catherine Lucey, Bloomberg’s White House correspondent, and said: “Quiet, piggy.” Lucey had asked Trump about the Epstein files, which is something of a sore topic. Meanwhile Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, seems keen to follow Trump’s lead when it comes to insulting female journalists. On Wednesday, the New Yorker writer Jane Meyer wrote on X that the attack on the national guardsmen was “so tragic, so unnecessary” as the national guard “should never have been deployed” to DC. Cheung wrote back: “Jane, respectfully, shut the fuck up for trying to politicize this tragedy.” It can’t be stressed enough that this isn’t just the president and his staff being a bit rude to a handful of female journalists. When the president insults these women, he opens them up to harassment from his acolytes. And, of course, he sends a message to the world about what he thinks about press freedom and what he thinks about women. According to Mary Trump, the president’s niece and a vocal critic of his politics, the president may inadvertently be sending another message with his recent behaviour. This week, Mary Trump noted on her YouTube show that her uncle’s “misogynistic attacks against reporters … are increasing” and believes that this points to two things. First, that “he’s increasingly comfortable lodging such attacks”, and second, “that he’s a little rattled” because the pressure is getting to him. In response, Cheung told the Daily Beast that Mary Trump is a “stone-cold loser”. I don’t know if “rattled” is quite the word for what is happening in Trump’s brain. Rather it would seem that Trump, who has frequently referred to himself as a “king”, would like to turn himself into another Mohammed bin Salman and the US into another Saudi Arabia. In the prince’s Saudi Arabia, journalists live under heavy surveillance, media outlets stick to the government narrative and a handful of critical tweets can get you locked up. The US might not be quite at that point yet, but it’s on the way. Mary Trump is right that the president is “increasingly comfortable” attacking female journalists. And, after all, why wouldn’t he be? He seems to suffer few consequences for these gendered attacks. Trump may wear his misogyny on his sleeve but there are plenty of women (and, of course, men) who are happy to overlook it. While it’s impossible to come up with exact numbers, polls and analysis show that a majority of white women supported Trump in 2024 – even after he was legally defined as a sexual predator by a New York jury. And Trump actually increased his support among female voters in 2024 versus 2020 and 2016. Trump can apparently call female reporters “piggy” all he likes; there are still plenty of Maga sheep willing to support him. More than 240 women allege drugging by senior French civil servant The women were given beverages during a supposed job interview with a senior civil servant. Unbeknown to the women, the drinks were mixed with a powerful and illegal diuretic that would make them need to urinate. The police found a spreadsheet titled “Experiments” on the civil servant’s computer, where he allegedly noted the times of druggings and the women’s reactions. Italy now recognizes the crime of femicide The new law punishes femicide with life in prison. Every day, 137 women and girls are killed by intimate partners or family members That’s according to the 2025 femicide report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and UN Women, which notes there has been little progress on the issue. The Free Birth Society is linked to baby deaths around the world Influencers have made huge amounts of money pushing the idea of “natural” births online and sowing distrust in the medical establishment. The result, a Guardian investigation shows, is scores of avoidable deaths. Israeli police raid Palestinian children’s play on Ben-Gvir’s orders The police stormed a performance of Dreams Under the Olive Tree at El-Hakawati theater in East Jerusalem on Sunday night and forced crying children to leave. The far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, gave the order to close the show, saying it didn’t have the required permit. The “you don’t have the right permit” excuse has long been invoked by Israel to bulldoze Palestinian houses and control Palestinian life. As the Norwegian Refugee Council explains: “Demolitions are rooted in a planning system that denies Palestinians the right to build in Area C, which covers more than 60 per cent of the West Bank and remains under full Israeli control. Palestinians must apply for permits that are almost never granted. Since October 2023, 282 applications have been submitted. Not a single one was approved.” Experts warn of ‘global crisis’ as number of women in prison nears 1 million The number of incarcerated women is rising much faster than men, with poverty, abuse and discriminatory laws driving this trend. The week in poultryiarchy Elon Musk is not the only power broker who seems to yearn to be a standup comedian. JD Vance addressed service members at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, ahead of Thanksgiving and attempted a poultry bit of humour. “Think about turkey,” Vance said. “Be honest with yourselves. Who really likes turkey?” When a few soldiers raised their hands he said: “You’re all full of shit.” He then riffed on this for a while before concluding: “Chicken is good all the time.” Trump is well practiced at throwing red meat to his base in speeches, but the dreadfully dry Vance always sounds as if he’s just winging it."

If Adolf Hitler, remarkably ignorant of the US, had grasped the true extent of American industrial might, would he still have fatefully declared war on Washington in 1941? When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, it evidently had no idea what it was getting into. Humiliating defeat contributed greatly to its subsequent disintegration. In 1990, Iraq’s Saddam Hussein attacked Kuwait, convinced he had a green light from the White House. In all these cases, stupidity produced disastrous misjudgments that proved fatal. China’s fractious relations with the western democracies suffer from similarly hazardous blindspots. The recent publication in state media of “explainer” articles apparently intended to provide reassurance about Taiwan’s future under Chinese rule exemplified this lack of mutual knowledge, to almost comical effect. When (not if) China takes charge, vetted “patriots” will govern Taiwan in a Beijing-approved regime modelled on Hong Kong, the articles said. Say again? Viewed from Taipei and the west, Hong Kong is a cautionary tale of nightmarish repression, brutal security laws, censorship – and broken Chinese promises dating back to the 1997 handover from Britain. How astonishing that even the most indoctrinated communist apparatchik may think Taiwan’s citizens, who cherish their democracy and de facto sovereign independence, would voluntarily follow this path. To assure peace and prosperity, secessionists would be crushed, state media declared brightly. It’s obvious – Beijing just doesn’t get it. China’s relentless siege of traditionally US-backed Taiwan has moved beyond crude military pressure (although that’s increasing). Its efforts to enforce the island’s economic and diplomatic isolation – and overthrow its pro-western, elected government – are augmented by spying, cyber-sabotage, mass surveillance and idiotic lies, conspiracies and disinformation. Announcing a $40bn increase in defence spending last week, Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, warned the annexation threat was “intensifying”. In an echo of Ukraine, which faces similar pressures from Russia and is likewise unsure of US support, Lai said the most worrying scenario was that browbeaten Taiwanese would simply give up. “Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s first preference is to win without a devastating, unpredictable war,” wrote analyst Hal Brands. “His method is encompassing, steadily escalating coercion … This is a classic ‘anaconda strategy’, meant to get progressively tighter until Taiwan yields. Isolation and demoralisation will ultimately produce capitulation, the thinking goes.” Xi would still use military force if coercion failed, Brands predicted. But China’s main thrust was aimed at “creating a sense, in Taiwan, that Chinese power is overwhelming; fostering a belief, in the US, that intervention is just too costly; and thereby convincing the people of Taiwan, some day, that their best option is to give up without a fight.” Political foolishness, rooted in historical enmity, is also fuelling the most heated crisis in China-Japan relations in a decade. It exploded when Japan’s newly installed, rightwing prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, answered a random question in parliament. Defending Taiwan and nearby trade routes from Chinese invasion, including by military means, was, she said, an existential issue “threatening [Japan’s] survival”. Takaichi, a protege of hawkish former PM, Shinzo Abe, was merely stating what she and many Japanese have long believed – but blurting it out loud, on the record, made it official. An incandescent China swiftly imposed sanctions and boycotts; both sides moved military assets towards disputed islands. China’s consul general in Osaka demanded Takaichi be “decapitated” in a tweet that was later deleted. That was exceptionally dumb. China’s hysterical reaction to what was basically a statement of the obvious is wildly exaggerated, indicating nervousness about where its Taiwan policy may lead. Takaichi’s provocative iron lady tribute act has won public backing, polls show, even though it came about almost by accident. But ignorance is not bliss. The risk of real conflict is too great. This row – and Lai’s alarm bells – have highlighted the Taiwan issue just as Xi was trying to neutralise it as a US-China bilateral problem. Xi has successfully repulsed Donald Trump’s tariff bullying this year. In particular, his swingeing, retaliatory export curbs on rare-earth minerals floored Washington. They marked a moment when global geopolitical power shifted. Lacking a strategy, Trump has now flipped from waging a trade war to gushing gratitude for an invitation to visit Beijing next April, obtained during his obsequious phone call to Xi last week. Trump subsequently offered no public assurances to Taiwan and, in a separate call, urged his Japanese ally, Takaichi, to pipe down. His truckling to Xi reinforced fears in Taipei and Tokyo that, as Ukraine knows, he’s chronically unreliable. For his part, Xi used the call to forcefully imply that if Trump really wants a big, beautiful trade deal to boast about at home, the US must formally accept that China’s sovereign right to Taiwan is an “integral part of the postwar international order”. Suspicions grow that Trump may ultimately subordinate defence of Taiwan to detente with China. At present, he seesaws. Promised arms packages are delayed or don’t arrive. Taiwan sought a free trade agreement. Instead, it was hit with 32% tariffs, later reduced. Now as before, the cluelessness in this dynamic is all Trump’s. Xi continues to run rings round him. Taiwan and Japan are not alone in worrying that Trump doesn’t understand what’s at stake. “The administration’s single-minded prioritisation of trade has led it to sweep thornier points of diplomatic contention under the rug,” wrote Jonathan Czin, a China specialist, pointing to Beijing’s unchecked human rights abuses, anti-western cyberwarfare, armed confrontations with the Philippines and overall South China Sea expansionism. As in Czechoslovakia in 1938, so in Ukraine and now, prospectively, in Taiwan. “History has proven that compromising with aggression only brings war and enslavement,” Lai warned. But Trump doesn’t read history. His ignorance kills. Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentator"
commentisfree_2025_nov_30_dates-age-hobbies-deal-breakers.txt,opinion,2025-11-30,Polly Hudson,"Don’t filter your dates by age and hobbies, ask them how they shop",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/30/dates-age-hobbies-deal-breakers,"A friend of mine once declined a date with a kind, funny, clever man because she hated his shoes. When she relayed this to our group of twentysomethings, it didn’t warrant comment or discussion, because it was such a rational decision, which we all would have made. I mean, come on – you can’t go out with someone with bad trainers, can you? Fortunately for the continuation of the human race, today’s daters appear to be a little less fastidious. A recent report on relationships by the dating app Plenty of Fish not only failed to mention footwear, but showed that people are keen to skip the small-talk phase, so weighty conversation topics such as life goals and dealbreakers are now brought up straight away. “What we’re seeing for 2026 is a real shift in mindset,” reports PoF’s PR manager, Eva Gallagher. “Singles have a more grounded sense of purpose.” This is a good start, but if you really want to know whether you’re suited to long-term togetherness, there are some topics you need to talk about from the off. These are the real dealbreakers, and would be much more fruitful dating-app search filters than age and hobbies. For example, how long before a flight do you arrive at the airport? This is rarely addressed at an early stage – and no, a mini-break during the honeymoon phase, where all quirks are adorable, does not count. If it was raised on the first date, those clearly seething couples who make far too many “shame if it’s not possible for us to sit together on the plane” jokes at check-in wouldn’t exist – and presumably no one would be happier about that than they would. Many question whether their star signs are compatible, but never their approaches to how to react when the film they’ve gone to see turns out to be terrible. This is far more important, unless you’re seeking a lifetime of arguing via the medium of mime and hissing. So are you team Life’s Too Short to Sit Through an Awful Movie, or team I’ve Paid My Money So I’m Staying Till the Bitter End? Pick well: they don’t mix. Food can be a relationship danger zone, far beyond the relentless hell of trying to decide what you should have for dinner every night. Never mind “Do you come here often?” – a far superior pickup line would be: “What’s your Sainsbury’s style?” If party A favours a supermarket technique that means their checkout camera footage is just a blur, with sparks flying off it, and party B enjoys a leisurely stroll up and down each aisle, perusing every product on sale, it could be a recipe for disaster. Then, even if you stay together long enough to make it home with your shopping, do you agree on how strictly to take food expiry dates? As the fairly new saying goes, one partner’s unforgivable waste is another’s food poisoning attempt. Other issues on which you need to clarify positions include when to put up the Christmas decs – and take them down – and annoyance levels when being spoken to from another room, so you can only vaguely hear what’s being said. All these little details seem trivial when you meet, inconsequential in the face of your epic love, but as the anniversaries roll by, you’ll find yourself muttering about them under your breath on an endless loop. Then, one day, you’ll feel instantly murderous at the mere mention of an airport, like somebody hypnotised to do a chicken impression at the sound of a trigger word. However, the frustrating truth is that even if you tackle all these dealbreakers head-on, you can’t future-proof your relationship against wildcards. I could have had the fullest, frankest conversation possible with my husband of 15 years the second we met, and it’s still extremely unlikely that he would have revealed his baffling stance on buying hot drinks when out of the house. To this man, who appears normal from the outside, carrying a takeaway cup is showing off. It’s sending an unbearably smug message to the world, boasting that you don’t have time to stop for a coffee. In his eyes, you should have put the kettle on before you left home, or you can just wait until you get back. This is a hill he is absolutely willing to die on. If he was gasping for water in a desert, and some was readily available in a cardboard receptacle, he would use his last sliver of energy to crawl past with his nose in the air. Somehow we have been bickering about how ludicrous this is/isn’t for nearly two decades now. He’s lucky his trainers are nice. • Polly Hudson is a freelance writer • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

commentisfree_2025_nov_30_dv-domestic-family-violence-alcohol-gambling-link-australia.txt,opinion,2025-11-29,Zoe Daniel,"When it comes to alcohol, gambling and domestic violence in Australia, it’s essential we connect the dots",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/30/dv-domestic-family-violence-alcohol-gambling-link-australia,"“How do we maintain the rage?” Sussan Ley asked in parliament last week. The opposition leader was speaking to a motion introduced by Labor’s Sharon Claydon to end family and domestic violence. Claydon read the list of the 74 Australian women who were murdered in the last year. “Every year I read this list in the hope it will be the last,” she said. “Heartbreakingly, that day has not yet come.” The rage remains. What’s missing is a proportionate response. Day after day we read the stories of women, and often children, killed by men. We light Parliament House up in orange, an initiative that I began with the speaker Milton Dick when I was an MP, now repeated annually by the government. We have a plan to end violence against women and children within a generation. Yet we continue to underfund it, on both prevention and response. As I’ve written before, gender-based violence, a sanitised term for the bashing, coercion, intimidation and murder of women, barely rated a mention in this year’s federal election campaign. In 2024 the prime minister, under pressure after a series of horrific deaths over the previous year, had named it a “national crisis” – which it is. But what’s changed? I have seen few words and even less action from the government on this since the election, and I don’t see any substantive policy or budget promises from the female-led Coalition either. Women’s legal services still can’t meet demand. Crisis housing services still can’t meet demand. Did you know that in Melbourne hundreds of women and children are placed in cheap motels every night by services that have nowhere else to send them? And there they remain, especially vulnerable to the same violent offenders. Every two minutes police are called to a domestic or family violence matter. Yet policing responses often fail, as Guardian Australia’s two-year-long Broken trust investigation has starkly reported. Red flags are too often missed. Data is inadequate and not synced up across states and justice systems. The real fix requires billions but even the $96.5m spent failing to fix the Bureau of Meteorology website, for example, would be welcomed by overstretched services. What better time to get a reality check than the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence. Enter the “toxic trio” so described by the journalist and advocate Jess Hill – sport, alcohol and gambling. It’s an inconvenient truth but, for the sake of our mothers, our sisters and our daughters, it’s time to better connect the dots. We know that violence against women spikes around big sporting events. We know that alcohol use spikes and with it domestic and family violence. We know that Australians are the biggest per-capita gambling losers in the world. We know that the fastest-growing group of problem gamblers in Australia is young men aged 18 to 24. And we know that the government is resisting banning ubiquitous gambling ads due to pressure from big gambling, big sport and big broadcasting. Studies show that family violence is three times more likely to happen in families where there is problem gambling. Research from Australia’s National Research Organisation for Women’s Safety shows that loss of income from gambling can intensify the frequency and severity of men’s intimate-partner violence against women. What is happening behind closed doors in your street, your suburb, while the game is on, the grog is flowing and the bets are failing? It’s not a big leap. The independent MP Helen Haines made the connection in the parliament with a question to the prime minister on Wednesday. Albanese acknowledged the link. “There is no question, as well, that the cause of violence can never be excused but, in many cases, that is one of the issues – along with alcohol abuse, along with so many issues that cause violence,” he said. The federal government’s own review into approaches to end gender-based violence recommended a phased ban on gambling advertising. The review also recommended other measures, such as restricting alcohol sales and advertising, and examining the density of poker machines in relation to the prevalence of family and domestic violence. So far, crickets. The evidence is there; the action is not. It’s heartening to see some in Labor speaking up on gambling advertising. The backbencher Dr Mike Freelander is right, in my view, when he says that a free or conscience vote across the chamber would yield a gambling ad ban. I know of members left, right and centre who would vote for it if unencumbered and able to vote based on the views of their communities. There are many arguments for it – protecting our children, reducing billions of dollars in public health costs, alleviating mental health issues and family breakdown, among others. This week, during the 16 days when we supposedly face into so-called gender-based violence, let’s also consider safety. It’s life and death. What could be more important than that?

commentisfree_2025_nov_30_labour-economic-renewal-budget-left-right-economy.txt,opinion,2025-11-30,Keir Starmer,There are those on the left and right who offer only grievance: Labour is getting on with the job of economic renewal,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/30/labour-economic-renewal-budget-left-right-economy,"At the budget last week, we made the right choices for Britain, cutting the cost of energy with £150 off bills, protecting the NHS and tackling the scourge of child poverty by removing the two-child limit. We also ensured that the revenue we raised through taxes was done fairly, with everyone contributing but those with the broadest shoulders contributing their fair share. As a result of the choices we made, the budget created a more stable economic environment, driving down inflation and government bond yields. This is vital for protecting our public services, when £1 in every £10 spent by government goes on debt interest. The budget builds on the action we have already taken to improve the economy: providing £120bn in extra capital investment in such things as roads, rail and energy; enacting the biggest planning reforms in a generation to back builders, not blockers; supporting the expansion of Heathrow and Gatwick; and signing trade deals with the EU, India and the US. Taken together, these have allowed us to exceed our growth forecasts. As I set out at the Labour party conference, the government’s purpose is nothing less than the renewal of our economy, our communities and our state. By doing that, we will end decline and restore faith in our country. We will take on those on the left and right who only offer grievance and whose approach would lead to further decline. Let me be clear, turning on the borrowing taps or returning us to austerity – that is the politics of decline and I will not accept it. In a speech on Monday, I will place the budget in the context of the broader economic renewal on which the government will be judged at the end of this parliament. If we are to achieve the national renewal we seek, we must do more to encourage growth, to tackle inactivity among young people and to pursue closer international cooperation with our trading partners. Our growth mission will include a renewed focus on sweeping away unnecessary regulation. Often it has been those on the left who have favoured regulation, but there is nothing progressive in regulations which serve only to increase the cost of living for the poorest, to slow down economic growth unnecessarily, or prevent a Labour government achieving its aims. That is why I am asking the business secretary, Peter Kyle, to tackle the type of pointless gold-plating and unnecessary red tape that add to costs and get in the way of our industrial strategy. Economic renewal also demands that we must continue to reform the welfare state. We inherited a failing system that left children too poor to eat and which wrote off young people as too sick to work. We must not accept either part of that failing Tory system. That is why we will do more to help young people achieve their potential. Because if you are ignored in your early career, if you are not given the support you need to overcome your mental health issues, or if you are simply written off because you are neurodivergent or disabled, then it can trap you in a cycle of worklessness and dependency for decades. This costs the country money, is bad for our productivity, but much more importantly, it takes away opportunity and ignores potential. Any Labour government worthy of the name cannot ignore that. That is why we have commissioned former health secretary Alan Milburn to make practical recommendations to help young people with health conditions access work, training or education – ensuring they are supported to thrive and not sidelined. Finally, we have to do more to help our businesses trade internationally. There is no credible economic vision for Britain that does not position us as an open, trading economy. We must confront the reality that the botched Brexit deal significantly hurt our economy. You do not need to have a PhD in economics to know that erecting unnecessary trade barriers with your biggest trading partner will hurt growth and raise the cost of living. So one element of our economic renewal will be continuing to move towards a closer trading relationship with the EU. If we can get cheaper food, boost growth and create jobs by having a closer relationship with the EU, we should. A budget based on fair choices for Britain must be backed up with a determination to achieve the economic renewal that the country needs. By delivering a big, bold long-term plan, not a set of quick fixes, we will renew Britain. We must become again a serious people, with a serious government, capable together of doing difficult things to regain control of our future. By having a clear mission to renew our economy, our communities and our state, we will deliver the change we promised – and then be judged on it at the next election.

commentisfree_2025_nov_30_labour-squeezed-middle-class-budget-families-voters.txt,opinion,2025-11-30,John Harris,The ‘squeezed middle’ is back – and this time it could be Labour’s undoing,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/30/labour-squeezed-middle-class-budget-families-voters,"Just over 15 years ago, a realisation began to dawn on British politicians, triggered by the financial crash of 2008 and its effects on millions of ordinary lives. Before that rupture, they had clung to the idea that a huge chunk of the public was made up of contented consumers and property owners. Now, though, any such certainties were being shaken – something highlighted by the Labour conference speech given in 2009 by Gordon Brown, which contained two particularly eye-catching words: “When markets falter and banks fail,” he said, “it’s the jobs and the homes and the security of the squeezed middle that are hit the hardest.” All these years later, the idea of an outwardly comfortable part of society anxiously feeling the pinch seems even more relevant. That is not, of course, to suggest that there are not millions of people living in much more precarious circumstances, nor that a Labour government should not prioritise their needs. Contrary to what you might read in certain news outlets, the squeezing of the middle has nothing to do with VAT on private school fees or the hourly rate charged by nannies. But the relevant stats definitely speak volumes about anxiety and uncertainty eating into lives that would once have been considered secure, and what that means for a country now brimming with a seething resentment that mainstream politicians seem unable – or unwilling – to do anything about. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, after years of wage stagnation, between now and 2030, households’ average disposable income is set to grow by only 0.5% a year. We all know what that means: the sudden pang of worry at the supermarket checkout, summers spent at home, the prohibitive expense of family visits to restaurants that fall north of £100, and people’s understanding that their children are growing up in an even more harshly competitive economy and society than they did. That last point, moreover, highlights that as new generations come of age, the squeezed middle is only expanding. The tale of last week’s budget is now curdling into questions about whether Reeves said misleading things about the public finances, but all this remains a massive part of the story – particularly when it comes to her extension of the freeze on tax thresholds. £50,000 a year is not really a sign of sky-scraping affluence, but people earning around that sum will be among those hit hardest. The verdict of Ruth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, is stark: “All but the top 10% of the income distribution are worse off because of opting for threshold freezes over [income tax] rate rises.” By 2031, nearly one in four taxpayers will have some of their earnings taxed at the “higher” 40% rate; Labour MPs have reportedly been citing the idea of the squeezed middle in relation to the effects on nurses, teachers and police officers. This is not the only element of Reeves’s new plan that is jangling nerves. The problem with her so-called smorgasbord approach to other tax rises is that it will surely look to millions of people like the government’s version of all that sneaky small print that fills up phone contracts and train-ticket regulations. Whether rightly or not, millions who would like to think of themselves as relatively secure and successful will look at what is planned – from more national insurance being levied on salary sacrifice pension contributions, reckoned to be paid by around a third of private sector employees, to a lower tax ceiling on cash Isas – and worry that they might sooner or later find themselves in the Treasury’s crosshairs. The squeeze such people feel is not only to do with their own finances: it is also bound up with the awful state of the public realm, and how little the government has to say on the subject. Local councils’ budgets remain impossible, and cuts to grassroots services are continuing to bite, something that brings to mind a point made 25 years ago by the Oxford historian Ross McKibbin: “The middle classes make more use of the NHS, public transport, public libraries, local swimming pools, [and] public parks … than anyone else.” But if they look to politicians for answers, what do they hear? On a bad day, a shrill din about immigration and “integration” that leaves such absolute basics untouched. Reeves and Keir Starmer personify an increasingly fragile and confused government, fixated on so-called hero voters in red wall constituencies, too keen on industrial nostalgia, and open to ideas that will only cause them even more problems: witness the influential Labour peer Maurice Glasman’s scorn for what he calls the “lanyard class”, a description that might describe just about everyone who gets on and off a commuter train each weekday. Worse still, the same contempt and condescension occasionally rears its head in a curled-lip mistrust of the middle class, sometimes voiced by people from the self-same layer of society. The latter is crystallised by an issue I regularly write about: the state of England’s special educational needs system (which the OBR now suggests will soon be faced with a £6bn funding gap, with no clear indication from the education department of how it will be filled), and the government’s plans for reform, finally due in the new year. As far as anyone understands it, ministers are still considering limiting families’ rights of redress, amid constant talk in politics and the wider culture about unfair advantages and the idea that, to quote one Labour MP, the current set-up “inherently favours better-off parents … with know-how of the system”. The government’s favoured answer might not be to make sure that many more people can exercise their rights, but to take refuge in the kind of equality that means nobody has any meaningful rights at all. I am a middle-class Send parent. If you take the long view, I have the relevant skills because I am the child of people whose lives were transformed by the Labour government of 1945-51, and huge social changes that took them from working-class backgrounds – my dad is the son of a coalminer – into university and secure public-sector jobs that firmed up the confidence that they passed on to me. These days, I sometimes wonder: are there politicians in the modern Labour party who think that kind of story might now have gone too far? And if policy starts to reflect the idea that people should pipe down and accept Whitehall’s idea of what best serves the common good, what does the government think that will mean for its popularity? Put another way, if such famous electoral stereotypes as Worcester woman and Mondeo man had kids with special needs, wouldn’t they doggedly battle the system, and be furious at the prospect of their ability to do so being taken away? I have been thinking lately about Herbert Morrison, the 20th-century Labour politician – and grandfather of that fallen party grandee Peter Mandelson – whose understanding of who his Labour needed to speak to and for was elegantly summed up by one of his biographers. Working-class voters were only part of the picture: Morrison, after all, “represented the suburbs, where lived the clerk, the minor civil servant, the municipal employee, the technician, the laboratory assistant, the elementary school teacher, the commercial traveller, the small tradesman and shopkeeper and the office executive”. I know who those people’s modern heirs are, and how they increasingly feel. They are anxious and angry not only about their own lives, but an increasingly awkward political question: will Labour ever really understand them? John Harris is a Guardian columnist"

It was a reminder of how concentrated wealth seems to buy access and bend policy. It may, alarmingly, become the norm if the global “inequality emergency” continues. That’s the message of the most recent work by the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz. The economist sees the yawning gap between rich and poor as a human-made crisis which is destroying politics, society and the planet. He’s not wrong. The problem is no longer confined to a few fragile states. It is a global harm, with 90% of the world’s population living under the World Bank’s definition of “high income inequality”. The US sits just below that threshold and is the most unequal country in the G7, followed by the UK. Prof Stiglitz’s insight is that the current system’s defenders can no longer explain its mounting anomalies. Hence he wants a new framework to replace it. His blueprint for change is contained within the G20’s first-ever inequality report, endorsed by key European, African and middle-income nations. It warns that the richest 1% captured 41% of all new wealth since 2000, while the bottom half gained just 1%. On average, someone in the global top 1% became $1.3m richer; a person in the poorest half gained $585. Meanwhile, 2.3 billion people are now moderately or severely food insecure – 335 million more than in 2019. Wealth concentration far outstrips income concentration, with billionaires’ assets worth one-sixth of global GDP. Shockingly, billionaire wealth is rising almost in lockstep with global food insecurity. The report argues that extreme inequality is a policy choice – produced by specific economic, political and legal decisions rather than by “globalisation” or technology. Financial deregulation, weakening labour protections and privatisation all aid rising inequality, as does cutting corporate and top income tax rates. The report stresses that the most dangerous consequences are political, with highly unequal countries seven times more likely to experience democratic backsliding or authoritarian drift. The Nobel prize winner points out that the super-rich account for a disproportionate share of carbon emissions, worsening climate risks borne by the poor. Crucially, Prof Stiglitz rejects the pro-market argument that inequality is good for growth. The G20 inequality report lays out a comprehensive redesign of global economic governance reminiscent of 1944’s Bretton Woods settlement. What led to that overhaul is being identified again today: global rules and institutions that are generating crises, instability and inequality. Prof Stiglitz wants structural change – suggesting a rewrite of intellectual property rules as well as trade and investment treaties, a reform of global lenders, and an update of tax systems as well as sovereign debt arrangements. A fairer global order must start where every paradigm shift begins: with knowledge, scrutiny and shared facts. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the UN-backed body assessing scientific opinion – was created in 1988 to give global authority to that knowledge. It reshaped climate politics. Prof Stiglitz argues that the time has come for an International Panel on Inequality. Hundreds of experts agree. Endorsing it is not radical; it is simply the first step towards a saner world. Without it, the gold-bar diplomacy circling Mr Trump will spread. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Children and parents spend months and years battling for support to which the law entitles them, schools lack the funding to meet needs, and specialist provision is inadequate. An adversarial system shunts families towards tribunals that councils almost invariably lose. Tory reforms created obligations for local authorities but did not adequately fund them – allowing ministers to duck responsibility. The result has been financial chaos, with the overall overspend on special educational needs and disabilities (Send) predicted to reach £6.6bn by next March, and keep rising. Taking responsibility for funding away from councils and handing it to the Department for Education is the right move. But the most important questions about Send go beyond accounting. A white paper on reform was postponed in October. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, told MPs that she would consult further before deciding on the future of education, health and care plans, which set out entitlements for individual children, and the tribunals where parents can challenge council decisions. After the government’s U-turn on disability benefit cuts, this pause looked like panic. If the extra time and the DfE’s beefed-up role lead to a stronger policy, it will have been worth it. But trust is lacking among campaigners who believe, with some justification, that cost-cutting is the underlying purpose. Unevidenced claims that lower spending will be a “side-effect” of any changes do not help. Labour’s stated aim, reiterated by Rachel Reeves, is a tilt towards the inclusion of children with additional needs in mainstream schools, away from separate provision. Rightly, ministers are determined to avoid a repeat of what happened in children’s social care, where a hollowing-out of public sector capacity created a space captured by private businesses, some funded by private equity. This is sound social democratic logic, and Ms Phillipson deserves credit for progress in children’s social care since last year’s election. Private investors should not be setting prices and making money from education budgets. But the breadth of experiences and needs encompassed by the category of Send is enormous, ranging from physical disabilities to behavioural problems and the growing number of children with an autism diagnosis. Not all needs will be met in mainstream settings. Labour’s white paper needs to grasp this complexity – and be honest about the time needed to embed effective changes. Parents and teachers need to be confident that the clock is not being wound back to a time when provision was broad-brush and basic, and often wholly inadequate. The Conservatives take credit where school standards have risen, but duck responsibility for changes that did not suit all pupils and made some schools and classrooms less inclusive. Ministers are justifiably angry about an inheritance that includes Boris Johnson’s refusal to fund a pandemic recovery package recommended by experts. But if they are serious about rebuilding a system that is resilient, they will need support beyond their own benches. Lifting children out of poverty should ease some pressures on schools. But that will take time. For now, Ms Phillipson faces a battle with the Treasury – and must win it. If she does not want to find herself fighting schools and families too, she must show that she understands there are no quick fixes – and no cheap ones. Children who face greater challenges than their peers have an equal right to an education. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

commentisfree_2025_nov_30_we-have-a-practical-framework-for-american-resistance-now-we-need-a-spiritual-one.txt,opinion,2025-11-30,Rami Nashashibi,We have a practical framework for American resistance. Now we need a spiritual one,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/30/we-have-a-practical-framework-for-american-resistance-now-we-need-a-spiritual-one,"Across the country, organizers are carrying something heavier, clearer and more spiritually charged than anything I have seen in over 30 years of this work. From veteran freedom fighters to young activists, there is a growing alignment around the unmistakable presence of evil in our public life. The horrors unfolding before us have sharpened our collective sight and deepened the understanding that our resistance must be morally unwavering and spiritually grounded. The spiritual framework for this argument begins with a simple conviction. Our movements need to reclaim a moral vocabulary that names evil plainly. Dr King understood this. When he named the pain of poverty, the sickness of racism and the excess of materialism, he called them the “triple evils”, speaking with unflinching clarity about the devastation that this collective evil was inflicting on the country, on our conscience and on our very souls. We are living in such a moment again. The evil is fully out, and anyone with spiritual integrity can see it. Among the forces driving that clarity are Gaza, empire and ICE. For two years, the world has watched the systematic slaughter of civilians in Gaza, an industrial scale cruelty carried out by one of the most powerful militaries on Earth. The devastation was not only permitted by the United States; it was carried out with our weapons, our cover and our political immunity. Not long ago, people still debated the nuances of settler colonial frameworks regarding Israel and its violence against Palestinians. Today, those debates feel like artifacts. Israel’s leaders stripped away any pretense about the humanity of people in Gaza. For those of us who pleaded for restraint or simply tried to name the horror for what it was, the clarity now burns. This was evil, unvarnished and unapologetic. And it has permanently shaped a rising generation and spiritually anchored communities across the globe. Meanwhile, our social media feeds are filled with the spectacle of an unmasked empire. We see a president boasting about overriding the sovereignty of other nations and pushing policies that echo the darkest chapters of western domination. The secretary of war mocks his own generals and bears a tattoo of a crusader cross. This administration openly embraces imperial imagery, with one official even circulating a meme casting the United States as Darth Vader on the world stage. One no longer needs a graduate seminar to diagnose the sickness. The empire declares itself. And now, on our own streets, we are confronted by a third force: a militarized domestic army funded at levels surpassing most of the world’s militaries. Agents swarm neighborhoods with assault rifles, launch teargas into crowds, smash windows, arrest parents in front of their children and force people into unmarked vehicles. Again, the evil is not hiding. It is filmed, livestreamed and normalized. This is the new face of the American empire, an open embrace of domination and dehumanization. The Four Ds framework emerged as a strategic response to this moment, seeking a collective U-turn away from authoritarianism and toward democratic renewal from below. It charts a path from authoritarian descent to democratic regeneration by disrupting the machinery of fear, delegitimizing its moral claim, generating defections from its alliances, and developing the world to come. While the Four Ds remain essential, they are not enough. Our movements also need a framework that speaks to the inner life of resistance, one that demands spiritual clarity and calls us to confront evil without exempting ourselves from its shadow. We need a language of collective repentance. In Hebrew and Arabic, the words for repentance and atonement share the same root. Teshuvah and Tawbah both mean to turn back, to return to the Divine, to integrity, and to the moral center we abandon when fear, cynicism or complicity pull us away. The Four Ds have a spiritually rooted corollary that I have developed into the 4Rs. I offer them here in the spirit of that collective turning. To disrupt. Authoritarian regimes depend on control. Disruption interrupts the machinery of oppression through non-violent civil resistance, collective non-cooperation, and public actions that expose contradictions within the system. Spiritually, disruption is a sacred refusal, the prophetic act of saying no to Pharaoh and grounding protest in spiritual discipline. With this in mind, I offer the first R: resonance. While disruption shakes structures of domination, resonance rebuilds the bonds of belonging. Resonance awakens the heart of the people through music, testimony, sacred gatherings and storytelling. It turns protest into poetry and solidarity into song, tuning our hearts to the same divine frequency. To delegitimize. No authoritarian system survives without legitimacy. Delegitimization exposes corruption, violence and moral bankruptcy at the system’s core. Its sacred roots lie in truth-telling, naming false gods, stripping power of its sacred disguise and asserting that divine authority belongs to justice, not domination. To deepen this work, I offer the second R: reignite. To reignite is to revive the moral and spiritual flame that sustains organizing, multifaith mobilizations and our commitment to justice and mercy. To cause defections. Systems collapse when their pillars of support crumble. Strategic defections persuade insiders to withdraw cooperation and shift loyalties. Spiritually, defections are moments of moral awakening that transform insiders into allies of justice guided by conscience rather than fear. The third R is reclamation. As pillars fall, movements must reclaim the sacred center. Reclamation brings forth ancestral traditions and resists the distortion of faith that has long been tied to oppressive regimes. To develop alternatives. Resistance must not only dismantle tyranny but cultivate the world that comes after it. The work of building alternatives is itself a sacred act, rooted in love, compassion and the prophetic imagination. The fourth R is radical reimagination. To radically reimagine is to remember that our sacred traditions expand our sense of what is possible. Radical reimagination fuels cooperative economies, creative sanctuaries and artistic interventions that refuse to capitulate to evil. Together, the Four Rs call for a sacred renewal. They urge us to resonate with the people’s pulse, reignite the moral flame, reclaim the sacred center and radically reimagine the world to come. For many, this is no longer merely an act of political resistance but a movement toward revolutionary repentance, Teshuvah, and Tawbah, to repair our broken hearts, systems and world. What’s giving me hope now What sustains me in this moment is a quiet but undeniable truth: the prophetic and universal stories carried by our scholars, saints, sages, griots, hakawatis and sacred cypher keepers are as alive now as they have ever been. Even in the shadow of so much darkness, their beauty still beats in the hearts of people who are crossing borders and boundaries of every kind to stand, walk and organize together. This collective rising, rooted in ancient wisdom and animated by a new generation, reminds me that a more just and merciful world is not only imaginable but is already being born.

sport_2025_dec_01_australia-wallabies-rugby-world-cup-fate-draw.txt,sport,2025-12-01,Jack Snape,Wallabies to learn Rugby World Cup fate at draw that favours 2027 hosts,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/australia-wallabies-rugby-world-cup-fate-draw,"The Wallabies will be afforded a golden runway to the 2027 World Cup quarter-finals in their bid to secure a first title in 28 years, despite their inability this year to secure a place as one of top seeds ahead of this week’s draw. Wednesday night’s proceedings in Sydney will unveil the minnows Australia are expected to trounce on their way to the knockout round, as well as the Wallabies’ main group rival and opponent in the pool stage’s marquee clash. Where the balls fall will also trigger a frantic two months for organisers as they plan an expanded tournament which may still include the MCG, even if Victoria’s deal with the NFL has limited dates available to use the 100,000-seat cauldron and frustrated rugby officials. The 24-nation showpiece has grown by four teams since the 2023 edition in France, where the Wallabies were knocked out in the pool stage for the first time. Six groups of four teams are the basis for a 52-match tournament held across seven cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Newcastle and Townsville. Australia – who ended a disappointing season with a winless European tour to finish 2025 ranked seventh in the world – are in band two for the draw, along with Fiji, Scotland, Italy, Wales and Japan. The Wallabies are already locked into Group A as hosts, and will be paired with one of the world’s top six from band one – South Africa, New Zealand, England, Ireland, France or Argentina. The other two teams in Australia’s pool will come from emerging rugby nations. One possible group would be Argentina, Australia, USA and Samoa; another is England, Australia, Uruguay and Hong Kong. The top two in each group will progress to the 16-team knockout round, which also includes the four third-placed teams with the most points. One of those teams will meet the winner of Australia’s pool, but even if the Wallabies finish second – in line with their current ranking – they will only meet a runner-up from another group, thereby avoiding a likely top seed in the round of 16. It’s a decided advantage for the hosts, given runners-up in pool B and pool D face other group winners. While stadiums for some matches are locked in, including the first match at Perth’s Optus Stadium and the final at Accor Stadium in Sydney, there is uncertainty around others. There is still a possibility Victoria’s two last-16 and seven pool matches include a fixture at the MCG. However, the state government’s multi-year deal with the NFL has left organisers in limbo. The tournament runs between the start of October and mid-November, overlapping the early weeks of the 2027-28 NFL season. Under Victoria’s much-vaunted NFL agreement, the American league is afforded a window to decide when to visit Melbourne. However, Rugby World Cup organisers will need to confirm matches by February next year when ticket pre-sales begin. The situation leaves the 53,000-capacity Marvel Stadium as the likely venue for even Melbourne’s most attractive matches. A Visit Victoria spokesperson declined to comment on commercial in-confidence deals, but said “we’re continuing to work with all parties to finalise details for games here”. Wednesday’s draw will allocate the lower-ranked teams first, leaving Australia’s group rivals to be determined as the final formal act of the evening. Recently retired Wallaby James Slipper, ex-All Black Dan Carter and Olympic sevens gold medal-winner Alicia Lucas are presenters, alongside Australian World Rugby chair Brett Robinson. The draw will be held in Sydney from 8pm (7pm in Brisbane, 5pm in Perth) and will be broadcast on Stan Sport, 9Gem and 9Now. Band one: South Africa, New Zealand, England, Ireland, France, Argentina. Band two: Australia, Fiji, Scotland, Italy, Wales, Japan. Band three: Georgia, Uruguay, Spain, United States, Chile, Tonga. Band four: Samoa, Portugal, Romania, Hong Kong, Zimbabwe, Canada"
sport_2025_dec_01_eben-etzebeth-red-card-south-africa-wales-disciplinary-hearing-rugby-union.txt,sport,2025-12-01,Luke McLaughlin,Eben Etzebeth to appear at hearing after red card for alleged eye-gouging,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/eben-etzebeth-red-card-south-africa-wales-disciplinary-hearing-rugby-union,"Eben Etzebeth is expected to appear at a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday after his red card for alleged eye-gouging in the dominant victory against Wales on Saturday, with the Springboks lock potentially facing a long ban. The verdict is likely to be announced on Wednesday. As South Africa closed in on a record 73-0 win in Cardiff, Etzebeth clashed with the Welsh back-row Alex Mann, appearing to make contact with his opponent’s left eye in a fracas involving several players from both sides. With two minutes left at the Principality Stadium, the 34‑year‑old was shown a red card by the referee, Luc Ramos, after a review with the television match official, Eric Gauzins. “You have a clear finger in the eyes, so for me, it’s a permanent red card,” Ramos said during the review. A ban would be a blow to Etzebeth’s club, the Sharks, who begin their Champions Cup campaign in Toulouse on Sunday before hosting Saracens in Durban six days later. The maximum ban for making intentional contact with an opponent’s eyes is four years, while an offence at the lowest end of the scale may result in a four-week suspension. A mid-range offence could involve an eight-week ban and a top-end offence 12 weeks, with any ban’s length potentially reduced in light of his previously good disciplinary record, and other submissions made by Etzebeth’s team. A number of factors will be considered, including the fact that Etzebeth reportedly apologised to Mann after the match. Should the panel find that Etzebeth intentionally eye-gouged his opponent, however, a long ban seems guaranteed. “I don’t know what I can say now that won’t be controversial,” Rassie Erasmus, South Africa’s head coach, said on Saturday. “It didn’t look good, I think it was a justified red card. How it happened and why it happened, and if he was provoked, I’m not sure. But that’s definitely not the way we would have liked to end the game.” In January, the South Africa wing and Etzebeth’s clubmate, Makazole Mapimpi, was banned for three matches having admitted making contact with the eye area of an opponent in a United Rugby Championship encounter against Cardiff. Mapimpi had previously been banned for two weeks for a similar incident involving Maxime Lucu, of Bordeaux, in 2023. In April Henco Venter, of Glasgow Warriors, received a six-week ban for making contact with the eye area of Dan Cole in a Champions Cup game against Leicester. Chris Ashton (10‑week ban in 2016) and Dylan Hartley (six-month ban in 2007) are other notable names to be punished for similar offences."
sport_2025_dec_01_f1-max-verstappen-red-bull-lando-norris-oscar-piastri-mclaren-title-race.txt,sport,2025-12-01,Giles Richards in Doha,Max Verstappen prepared to ‘maximise everything’ in F1 season-deciding finale,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/f1-max-verstappen-red-bull-lando-norris-oscar-piastri-mclaren-title-race,"Max Verstappen is fired up to go to Abu Dhabi and compete for his fifth F1 world championship after the Dutchman won in Qatar, narrowed the gap to 12 points within the championship leader, Lando Norris, and overtook Oscar Piastri to set up a three‑way season-deciding finale at the Yas Marina circuit. Verstappen produced a superb drive for Red Bull in Lusail on Sunday but it was a victory handed to him by McLaren, who made a calamitous strategy call for Norris and Piastri. In choosing not to pit their drivers under an early safety car when the rest of the field did so, they lost a free stop and gave the lead to Verstappen who seized his chance and powered to the flag. With Piastri second and Norris only fourth, it has brought the Dutch driver right into the title fight for the last round. He is second behind Norris but ahead of Piastri, a position he considered unthinkable halfway through the season. “I’m excited, I’m happy to go there and have a go at it,” he said. “I go in there with just positive energy. I try everything I can but at the same time, if I don’t win it, I still know that I had an amazing season. So, it doesn’t really matter. It takes a lot of the pressure off. I’m just out there having a good time like I had on Sunday. “I know that when I sit in the car, I always try to maximise everything I can. And that’s what I’ll try to do in Abu Dhabi. A race like Qatar shows that when you think it’s going to be boring and straightforward, it’s not. So I’m hoping Abu Dhabi is going to be similar.” Verstappen goes into the decider with nothing to lose given he had no expectation of being a contender for most of this season. After the Dutch GP – round 15 of the season – on 31 August, he was 104 points behind the then leader Piastri and was explicit that he believed the title was beyond him. Red Bull, however, brought a series of upgrades to the next round in Monza, including changes to the floor and front wing, in an attempt to address the balance problems that had stymied their car at most tracks during the season. They proved enormously successful, with Verstappen finally feeling comfortable with his ride, and since then he has returned five wins and three podiums. He paid tribute to the team effort behind his success. “We’ve won races where maybe we shouldn’t have, like Sunday, by making the right call as a team,” he said. “Of course, it’s still up to me to execute it in the best way possible but that’s also a proper team effort. “The way I work with my race engineer, with GP, [Gianpiero Lambiase] and also the guys in the background – the whole team very close to me – I think we’re really well integrated and we know exactly what we need to ask of each other. That probably helps also when you’re in a battle like this, when you’re not the quickest, but you still pretty much maximise everything you’ve got.” Norris remains the favourite going into the race with a 12‑point lead but McLaren have managed to let themselves be put under immense pressure by Verstappen and Red Bull. At the previous round in Las Vegas, both their cars were disqualified for exceeding the wear on the skid block on the floor of the car, handing Verstappen a 25-point gain and moving him from 49 points back to 24, a deficit he reduced to 12 after McLaren’s blunder in Qatar. Norris will still take his first title if he finishes in front of both his rivals or claims third place or better. Verstappen would need to win and hope Norris finishes outside the podium places while Piastri, 16 points down, would need to win and have Norris finish sixth or lower. Last time Verstappen went into a decisive season-finale in Abu Dhabi was in 2021, when he was tied on points with Lewis Hamilton. He went on to claim his first title that year after the race ended in controversy, with the then race director Michael Masi improvising an interpretation of the rules to ensure the race did not finish behind a safety car. The FIA later described the decision as “human error”; the result stood."
sport_2025_dec_01_fuzzy-zoeller-obituary.txt,sport,2025-12-01,Peter Mason,Fuzzy Zoeller obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/fuzzy-zoeller-obituary,"The golfer Fuzzy Zoeller, who has died aged 74, won two majors – the US Masters in 1979 and the US Open in 1984, both by virtue of a playoff. His Masters success was especially notable for the fact that it was Zoeller’s debut in the competition, making him the first golfer since 1935 (and still only the third) to win on his first appearance. He won the sudden-death playoff against Tom Watson and Ed Sneed with a par and a birdie, sinking a six-foot putt on the second extra hole and hurling his putter high into the air as the ball disappeared into the cup. Zoeller’s US Open victory at Winged Foot five years later was remembered for his light-hearted interaction with his play-off rival, Greg Norman. When Norman holed a lengthy putt on the last of the 72 holes, Zoeller, who was behind him on the fairway, mistakenly thought the Australian had gone into the lead, and waved a white towel in mock surrender. But Norman’s putt had only drawn him level, and Zoeller was able to secure a par on the last to maintain parity. During the subsequent 18-hole playoff, which Zoeller won by eight strokes, Norman returned the gesture by flapping his own white towel at the 18th. As well as those two big wins, Zoeller picked up eight other PGA tour victories in the US. He was also runner-up at the 1981 USPGA tournament in Duluth, Georgia, third in the 1994 Open championship at Turnberry, and played in three Ryder Cups, in 1979, 1983 and 1985, although he had a terrible record in that competition, losing eight of his 10 matches, with just one win and one draw. Born Frank Urban Zoeller in New Albany, Indiana, to Frank Sr, an executive at a wood veneer business, and his wife, Alma (nee Cummings), he was known as Fuzzy from an early age, on account of his initials. He started playing golf at the age of three, and shone in the sport at New Albany high school, Edison Junior College in Florida, and Houston University in Texas, before turning professional in 1973. He earned his USPGA tour card the following year and after a modest first season improved vastly in his second with four top 10 finishes, two of which were in the runner-up slot. A quick player, he was easygoing on the fairways and could often be seen whistling and cracking jokes with the crowd. Considered long off the tee in those days, Zoeller subsequently put himself into a number of good positions to win, but had begun to gain a reputation as something of a choker until his first win came in 1979, at the San Diego Open. Ten weeks later he won the Masters at the age of 27, taking advantage of a collapse by Sneed, who had looked to be the winner before bogeying the last three holes. “I’ve never been to heaven, and, thinking back on my life, I probably won’t get a chance to go,” Zoeller joked. “But I guess winning the Masters is as close as I’m going to get.” At the 1984 US Open, Zoeller had a three-stroke lead after nine holes of the final round, but Norman had drawn level by the 17th. On the 18th, Norman hit his approach shot into the stands, but after receiving relief without penalty chipped to 45ft from the flag and holed the par putt. It was then that Zoeller, standing in the group behind and believing Norman had just registered a birdie, waved his white towel. The playoff on the following day turned out to be heavily one-sided, with Zoeller leading by five shots after nine holes, and stretching the distance by a further three on the back half. The following year Zoeller was given the USPGA’s 1985 Bob Jones award for distinguished sportsmanship. After that second major there were expectations of more to come. But Zoeller’s momentum slowed, and his next tournament victory, at the Anheuser-Busch golf classic in Virginia in 1986, proved to be his last on the main US tour, at the age of 34 – although he did have five top 10 finishes in the majors between 1986 and 1994. In 1997, in the twilight of his career, Zoeller’s fondness for wisecracking embroiled him in controversy as Tiger Woods became the first black player to win a major – at the Masters. Relaxing with a drink in the Augusta clubhouse, Zoeller was collared by a CNN journalist looking for some off-the-cuff thoughts about Woods’ imminent victory. While he praised Woods’ performance, he also jokingly referred to the 21-year-old as “a little boy” and said he hoped that he would not be choosing fried chicken and collard greens for the celebratory champions dinner. Although he swiftly apologised for the racial stereotyping – and Woods later brushed aside the incident – Zoeller found it difficult to repair the damage to his reputation, which led to the loss of lucrative sponsorship deals and caused him anguish for years. In 2002 he joined the over-50s Champions Tour in the US, winning the Senior PGA Championship in Ohio in 2002 and the Mastercard Championship in Hawaii in 2004 before playing his last event in 2017. He also designed golf courses, and enjoyed hunting and fishing. Zoeller’s wife, Diane (nee Thornton), whom he married in 1976, died in 2021. He is survived by their children, Sunnye, Heidi, Gretchen and Miles. • Frank (Fuzzy) Urban Zoeller, golfer, born 11 November 1951; died 27 November 2025"
sport_2025_dec_01_in-the-nfls-season-of-meh-even-the-battered-49ers-are-super-bowl-contenders.txt,sport,2025-12-01,Melissa Jacobs,"In the NFL’s season of meh, even the battered 49ers are Super Bowl contenders",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/in-the-nfls-season-of-meh-even-the-battered-49ers-are-super-bowl-contenders,"The 49ers’ season felt over after Week 6’s loss to Tampa Bay. Yes, they were 4-2. Yes, they were tied with the Seahawks and Rams and had already won head-to-head games against both. But that’s when they hit rock bottom. All Pro linebacker Fred Warner was the latest casualty, following in the footsteps of All Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa with a season-ending injury. Brock Purdy had also struggled with injuries. George Kittle was hurt in Week 1. Both were not expected to return for several games. Brandon Aiyuk had no plans to play any time soon, at least not for San Francisco. By Week 7, the only big names in action were Christian McCaffrey and Trent Williams. Dire as the 49ers appeared on paper, they hung in. It helped that the Cardinals, Falcons, Giants, and Panthers featured in their upcoming schedule. They beat all four of them, losing only to the Texans and Rams in the next few weeks. None of the wins inspired much confidence, though. The Cardinals outgained the 49ers by 200 yards. Purdy threw three interceptions against the Panthers. Finally, on a windy day in Cleveland, the 49ers looked like they belonged in the playoff conversation. Sunday’s 26-8 win was the franchise’s first in Cleveland since 1984. There was nothing splashy stat-wise, just smart, mistake-free football against one of the league’s top defenses. Purdy was efficient, going 16-of-29 for 168 yards and one touchdown. He ran in another on a third-and-goal read-option. Purdy had solid protection and was sacked just once by Myles Garrett, a great accomplishment this season. Robert Saleh’s defense dominated as Clelin Ferrell and Keion White broke through with key sacks. And Skyy Moore’s 66-yard punt return in the first-quarter set the tone for the game. As 49ers beat reporter David Lombardi points out, the last 49ers win in Cleveland came the week after a four-interception game by Joe Montana. The 49ers would go on to win the Super Bowl that year. That outlook is a stretch for this group. Purdy is not Montana, and there is no healthy defender on the current 49ers roster at the same level as Ronnie Lott. That group was 15-1. This crew is 9-4 and sitting as the seventh seed in the playoff picture. There remains a lot of patchwork throughout the roster. But there is one stark advantage for the modern 49ers – there is no outstanding team in the NFL this season. There is no longer certainty that Patrick Mahomes will lead the Chiefs to a dramatic comeback, no matter the odds. Or that Josh Allen can control a game with his legs. Or that Bo Nix and Drake Maye will be able to handle the pressure come playoff time. In the NFC, the once magical Lions have no identity and a bevy of issues on defense. The Rams are the NFL’s most complete team but don’t have a sure-thing offense. The Eagles were wildly outcoached by Ben Johnson and the Bears, the No 1 seed at the moment, are missing a lot of pieces. The only sure thing in the NFL in 2025 is the shrewdness of a handful of coaches. The 49ers’ Kyle Shanahan is, of course, among them. As are Johnson and Sean McVay. Mike Vrabel, Sean Payton, and Brian Schottenheimer are also coaches youdon’t want your team facing in the playoffs. That’s what so strange about this season. Some rosters are far more compelling than San Francisco’s. But there is no quarterback playing like Tom Brady, Peyton Manning or peak-era Mahomes. So the competitive advantage may ultimately lie in coaching. Factors like preparation, aggressiveness, and team chemistry probably mean a lot more this season. If that remains the case, don’t count out the 49ers. MVP of the week Bryce Young, QB, Carolina Panthers. In a wild back-and-forth victory for the Panthers over the Rams, Young reminded us why he was once the NFL’s No 1 overall pick. Young went toe-to-toe with Matthew Stafford and the Rams’ sensational offense as well as the team’s top-rated defense. In the 31-28 upset win, Young threw three touchdowns, no interceptions and was 15-of-20 for 206 yards. He brought the magic when it counted most, going 2-for-2 for 76 yards and two touchdowns on fourth down. His third touchdown was on third and eight. It doesn’t get more clutch. Young’s play has been inconsistent (see his game against San Francisco last week), and one lights-out performance won’t convince the skeptics. But against the Rams, Young showed Carolina all the intangibles he brings, especially heart. With the win, there is a plausible chance Young gets a taste of the postseason. The 7-6 Panthers are half a game behind the NFC South-leading Bucs, and the two teams face off twice before the end of the season. Stat of the week 76. Thank goodness for Josh Allen’s legs because his arm wasn’t getting it done Sunday. Allen’s eight-yard rushing touchdown in the fourth-quarter not only cemented the Bills’ 26-7 win over the Steelers, it gave him sole possession of the NFL record for rushing touchdowns by a quarterback, with 76. He had previously been tied with Cam Newton. The game’s star quarterbacks, Allen and Aaron Rodgers, struggled to get their offenses going. Allen ended the first half with just 51 passing yards and an interception. A head-butting altercation with Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward seemed to fuel Allen and the Bills to a much cleaner and efficient second-half. Allen hit Keon Coleman for a score after a nice pump fake. But it was James Cook’s 144 rushing yards that sealed the Bills’ victory. With the win, the Bills keep pace as the seventh seed in the AFC. They face the Joe Burrow-led Bengals next. Video of the week “I know you guys are hungry for more, right? The city of Chicago is hungry too,” Bears head coach Ben Johnson proclaimed in the team’s raucous locker room after Friday’s win over the Eagles. Then he ripped his shirt off. The fired-up players encircling Johnson knew why. So too did Bears fans. Free hot dogs for all! The Wiener Circle, a hot dog stand that has become a Chicago institution, promised free hot dogs if Johnson took off his shirt after a Bears victory. To say Johnson has won over Chicago is an understatement. The Bears are 9-3, winners of five straight, NFC North leaders, AND currently the No 1 seed in the NFC after the Rams’ loss. The confidence instilled by Johnson was on full display in Philadelphia. Chicago bullied the Eagles, especially in the trenches. The Bears run game had its way thanks to a combination of shrewd playcalling and elite blocking. D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai rushed for over 100 yards, the first time since 1985 the Bears had two 100-yard rushers in a game. The defense held its own, limiting Saquon Barkley to 56 yards on 13 carries. They also stopped a fourth-down tush push. The Bears were sharper, controlled the tempo, and simply seemed to want it more. That’s the Ben Johnson effect. Elsewhere around the league • Bucs tackle Tristan Wirfs – all 320lbs of him – provided a fun spark, hauling in his first-ever touchdown in his team’s 20-17 win over the Cardinals. The big guy touchdown came after two other “touchdowns” on the same drive were nullified by penalties. • Extra-point drama in the Colts-Texans game! No, your eyes did not deceive you. Texans kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn clearly missed an extra-point wide left but the refs called it good, and the play wasn’t reviewable. “Since the ball was above the upright it’s not reviewable,” referee Clay Martin said after the game. The touchdown was also aided by a phantom pass interference call on Colts cornerback Kenny Moore. The Texans went on to win the game between two teams battling for the AFC South title, and the contest did not need such substandard officiating. • Northern Ireland’s Charlie Smyth, a graduate of the NFL’s International Pathways Program, had a pretty good start to his pro football career. The former Gaelic footballer drilled a 56-yarder with his first attempt in the NFL and also had an onside kick recovered, although his team lost 21-17 to the Dolphins. Smyth only learned he was playing at late notice and had to rush his family over the Atlantic to Miami to see the game. “If we had to wait another three or four hours longer, I don’t think it would have been possible,” Smyth said, revealing his parents and sisters had suffered delays on the way over. “It was so awesome to see them here.” • Continuing our special teams debut special: Jaguars nose tackle DaVon Hamilton subbed in as his team’s long snapper after an injury to Ross Matiscik in the first quarter. He successfully snapped on a field goal, extra point and three punts. “That was very exciting,” Hamilton said. “Definitely not something I want to do on a day-to-day basis. I’m going to leave this to Ross. But it was fun.” Hamilton’s snaps helped the Jags to a 25-3 win over the Titans, which puts them top of a tight race in the AFC South over the Colts and Texans. • Just another routine catch for Puka Nacua. And don’t get us started on Brock Bowers. And Treylon Burks, come to think of it."
sport_2025_dec_01_marnus-labuschagne-australia-cricket-second-ashes-test.txt,sport,2025-12-01,Simon Burnton in Brisbane,Marnus Labuschagne backs Australia’s pink ball experience to tell in second Ashes Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/marnus-labuschagne-australia-cricket-second-ashes-test,"Marnus Labuschagne has said Australia’s experience of playing day‑night Tests will help them to start the second Ashes Test on Thursday with an in-built advantage, while England are using a pink ball for the first time in nearly three years. As well as hosting more day-night Tests than the rest of the world in total, Australia has also scheduled several Sheffield Shield games under lights and with a pink ball, first between 2013 and 2018 and again in each of the past two seasons. Cricket Australia’s head of national teams, Ben Oliver, explained when they were reintroduced that they are designed “to enhance the experience for domestic players and best prepare them for the challenges of international cricket”. “Would I prefer to play [with a] red ball over a pink ball? Probably, just because you play with it more, you’re used to the colour of the ball, you’re used to those things, and there’s a few intricate things about the pink ball that make it a bit of a different game,” Labuschagne said. “When it first came along everyone was like: ‘No, we want a red ball.’ It’s become something that Australia have been very good at. We’ve learned over time the different moments of the game and how to play them. Hopefully that can be an advantage for us going into this game.” Australia also boast in Mitchell Starc the world’s most successful purveyor of pink-ball swing bowling. “Is he the best pink-ball bowler in the world? I think the stats probably say that,” Labuschagne said. “I think it’s his high pace, it’s late swing, and you combine them and in the right conditions at the right time the pink ball just does swing more, or it swings later and more inconsistently, which makes it hard to line up. I think it’s a combination of being a left-hander, swinging it at high pace and swinging it late, that’s probably what makes him so dangerous.” Labuschagne, whose batting average in day-night Tests is, at 63.86, 38% better than his career average of 46.34, said the key to a team’s success is adapting to the unique changes in conditions the timing brings. “The pink ball is slightly different. The different conditions at different times of day certainly has more impact,” he said. “I don’t know why my record has been good against the pink ball, but it’s something I’ve enjoyed. It provides so much opportunity at different times – you have to change your game, you have to adapt and there are certain times where there are lulls and then certain times where the game speeds up.” The partnership with Nathan McSweeney against India in Adelaide last year, when the pair successfully negotiated the last 22 overs of the first day under floodlights, was used as an example. “It’s just different moments you have to win along the way,” Labuschagne said. “There’s moments where, if you play well in that moment, it really sets you up. Last year Nathan and I got through that night session and then we were able to capitalise on the next day session and we were able to bowl at night again, then we made inroads and flipped the script a little bit. If you win the toss [and bat first] it can set the match up really nicely for you to continue to have the night session.” Labuschagne pushed back against the view recently expressed by Pat Cummins and Travis Head that batting orders are an increasingly outdated concept. “I think where you bat in the order just pushes back the time that you come to the crease, and I think that’s why there is a batting order, because certain times suit certain players and the way they play,” he said. “But at the end of the day it doesn’t matter where you bat, you’ve just got to find a way to score runs.”"
sport_2025_dec_01_peter-wright-obituary.txt,sport,2025-12-01,Mark Williams,Peter Wright obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/peter-wright-obituary,"My friend and former colleague Peter Wright, who has died aged 79, was a racing car engineer. He helped the Lotus Formula One team win the world championship in 1978 by co-inventing (with Ralph Bellamy) the “ground effect” chassis design, an innovation that improved tyre contact with the track, thereby greatly enhancing adhesion and handling. He later became managing director of Lotus Engineering, where he finessed the revolutionary “active suspension” system that he had pioneered in an earlier role with Colin Chapman, the founder of Lotus. Despite dwindling financial resources, Peter worked with many others to keep the Lotus racing team going until 1994, when the money finally ran out. His career then took a sideways turn when Max Mosley, the boss of the sport’s governing body, the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA), hired him to help improve driver safety. Working with the FIA’s medical delegate, Sid Watkins, he helped develop new cockpit materials, helmet designs and safety barriers, all of which dramatically reduced fatal and life-changing accidents and had a major influence on domestic car design. In recognition of this he was appointed president of the FIA safety commission in 2010, where he remained until 2021. Peter was born in Farnham, Surrey, to John Wright, a polar explorer, and Dorothy Fetherstonhaugh, who worked at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge. The family lived for a time in Sudan, where Peter was home-schooled by his mother until he was sent to be a boarder at Wellington college in Berkshire. Gifted as he was, he admitted to neglecting his later studies at Trinity College, Cambridge, leaving with a lowly third in mechanical engineering. However, in 1967, having secured a holiday job at British Racing Motors, he sufficiently impressed their technical director, Tony Rudd, to be offered a full-time post working on their complex engine projects and aerodynamics. After Rudd was fired in 1969, Peter joined Specialised Mouldings, who made fibreglass bodywork for various racing teams. While there he met Chapman, who noted his pioneering work on reducing the weight of cars. He joined Lotus in 1974. Away from racing, Peter restored and flew a vintage Tiger Moth plane, developed a new style of engine system for gliders and built and raced exotic sports cars, including a Bugatti Type 51 and a rare chain-driven GN cyclecar. Using the bones of a derelict barn, he also built a sustainable home on a Welsh Marches hillside just outside Presteigne in Powys, living off-grid with his third wife, Dorothy (nee McGuire), whom he married in 2018. In addition he found time to write a book, F1 Technology and Ferrari Formula 1, published in 2003, and contributed articles to several specialist periodicals, including Classic Motoring Review, which I edited. In 2024 he wrote a richly entertaining memoir, How Did I Get Here? Peter’s first two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by Dorothy and by three children, Meg and Alice, from his first marriage to Melody Sanger, and Harold, from his second marriage, to Hanna (nee Woolhouse)."
sport_2025_dec_01_tasmania-afl-stadium-plan-in-pieces.txt,sport,2025-12-01,Jack Snape,Division and derision: how plans for an AFL stadium left Tasmania in pieces,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/tasmania-afl-stadium-plan-in-pieces,"In a state with a rich history of activism, Sunday was a protest against a protest. Around 15,000 braved the rain to gather at Hobart’s parliament house to tell the soon-to-vote crossbenchers: “Yes stadium.” The AFL’s invitation in 2023 for Tasmania to join the mainland’s premier competition is arguably the greatest gift in Australian sport. The condition of that offer however, that the poorest state builds an expensive stadium on a precious parcel of land, has been described as “unconscionable”. Even the project’s lead proponent, premier Jeremy Rockliff, accepts for many the deal is not perfect. While the AFL is investing tens of millions of dollars each year in Tasmania, it has offered just $15m for a roofed venue now quoted at $1.13bn. Take out the $240m committed by the federal government, and Tasmania – already $5bn in debt and having had its credit rating downgraded just last week – will have to find the remainder. So eye-watering are the numbers, so strong is the opposition, and so tight is this week’s decisive parliamentary vote, that thousands were motivated to assemble on Sunday, fearing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was slipping away. The Liberal leader took to the stage just after 2pm, as the drizzle over Hobart began to intensify. “I think we’re going to need an even bigger stadium,” Rockliff said. Organisers had hoped the gathering might become Tasmania’s largest ever political rally. History’s numbers are rubbery, but approximately 10,000 protested against damming the state’s wild rivers in 1983, and around 5,000 marched against the conflict in Vietnam in 1970. Thousands expressed opposition to the Iraq war in 2003, rallied against public service strikes in 2018, and turn out each year demanding the date of Australia Day be changed. In that context, the turnout on Sunday was impressive, particularly given the weather. Police described it as “a significant crowd, with potentially up to 15,000 people”. By comparison, the previous week’s anti-stadium rally attracted 7,000 according to organisers, while police provided an estimate of 1,500. Bob Brown, who coordinated opposition to the dams, once wrote protest was “to fight that the world might avoid the worst and survive for a future worth living”. Sunday was unlikely to be what he had in mind. Rockliff, as the man who cut the deal with then-AFL chief executive Gil McLachlan in 2023, is regarded by Sunday’s crowd as a hero. He praised the dripping attendees for giving Tasmania “hope”, and singled out those who were at a rally for the first time. “The big difference between this rally and so many other rallies around Tasmania, you’re actually standing here for our future, and for something, not against something.” What made Sunday unusual for a protest was the power of those on stage. Rockliff might have worn a custom-made jumper with “Rocky” on its back, but his is no underdog cause. He was standing alongside the Labor leader Josh Willie, former Labor leader David O’Byrne, a local construction union leader, and famous football, basketball and business names. Behind the mic came a procession of Devils proponents and even one Demon, in Melbourne president and Tassie product Brad Green. One speaker, local real estate adviser Jacob Field, described his audience as “makers”, while the anti-stadium brigade were “takers”. Division and derision were a consistent theme. Despite the influential support and the polarising political language, the event was held in the guise of a grassroots movement. Pro-stadium Facebook page administrator and Sunday’s organiser Mark Brown described himself as “just a regular bloke from the suburbs” and thanked his family, as one of his children hugged him. “We have spoken with our feet today,” he said. “And I urge the MLC upper house members to approve the stadium when it comes before them this week.” Those who have argued against the stadium have called for the money to instead be spent on health, education and housing. This group within Parliament include the Greens and a handful of independents. There are also many within the community who feel – even if they do want an AFL team representing the state – the stadium is too expensive, it’s in the wrong place, or that planning has failed the local Palawa people and former diggers who both share a connection to the Macquarie Point site designated for the arena. An independent planning assessment found the project should not proceed due to its high cost and a myriad of problems in its final report released in September. Treasurer Eric Abetz labelled the commission’s conclusions as “subjective assessments”. Last week, urban planner Shelley Penn – one of the assessors and a Melbourne-based architect and urban planner – offered her response: “There’s a difference between taste and quality.” VFL great Brent Crosswell, a member of the Tasmanian team of the century, spoke against the building the previous week, saying the AFL’s requirement of a stadium for the team was “condescending” and “despicable”. “Once we’ve got this stadium here, which we are revolted by, what is charming will cease to be charming,” he said, describing the building as “a great moon ball” that “will move across the cityscape and deface things”. The Devils – the team that has quickly attracted more than 200,000 members – are almost universally welcomed, but there is a sense within the community that the mainlanders at AFL House have pushed a hard bargain on Tasmania. Brendon Gale, the former Richmond player and chief executive who returned to his home state to lead the Devils, defended the deal. “The AFL has given the state an opportunity to be part of this incredible national platform and put the state on the map, and also tap into all their economic benefits and the revenue stream,” he said, adding “you’ve got to invest for that”. Independent MP Kristie Johnston was part of a group that travelled to Melbourne at the end of October requesting a meeting with the AFL, to try to find some kind of alternative. “Tasmanians are passionate about their football, they love their football, they want a team, but what they [AFL officials] have put before us is an unconscionable deal,” she said. New AFL chief operating officer Tom Harley met the group in the meeting room looking out over Docklands, a precinct that is still waiting to be enlivened by its own stadium some three decades on. He heard their concerns then, after the allotted 30 minutes, stood and wound the meeting up. The AFL issued a brief statement afterwards, saying Harley “listened to a range of views and appreciated the group travelling to AFL House and putting those views forward”. Ultimately though, the AFL’s “position has not changed”. Roland Browne, a Tasmanian lawyer who helped organised the anti-stadium rally, said whatever the result this week, the debate has been a stain on the state. “The healing that will be needed, whichever way this decision goes this week, is very significant,” he said. “It’s been acrimonious, and there’s no end point if a decision is made that the stadium is to be built.” Brian Clark, a retired mechanic, wore his myrtle green on Sunday. The 66-year-old was attending just his second public rally, after an experience during his parents’ final years motivated him to support the voluntary assisted dying movement in 2020. “There’s going to be a lot of angst if this doesn’t go through,” he said. “It’s part of Tasmania, it’s part of me. I’m nearly 70 and I want this. I’ve wanted it for 30, 40 years.” He said he wouldn’t usually be out on a Sunday, and he is currently managing prostate cancer. But he was adamant this was a cause he will keep supporting, even if parliament votes against the stadium this week. “Just hope that it’s not all finished yet, which I would imagine is the case, keep trying,” he said, before turning towards Mount Wellington. “It’s like our cable car up here.” • This article was amended on 1 December 2025 to remove an image of a stadium design proposed for Regatta Point before the final location of Macquarie Point was confirmed."

In the final stages of the race Norris, who had been chasing Antonelli for fourth place, managed to get past the Italian when he made an error at turn nine and went wide through turn 10, ensuring the British driver’s advantage over Verstappen was 12 rather than 10 points going into the last race of the season. That gap means Norris can finish third rather than second at the title-deciding finale in Abu Dhabi this weekend and still claim the championship from Verstappen, who is in second place. At the end of the race the Dutch driver’s engineer Gianpiero Lambiase told him over the radio that it looked like Antonelli had “just pulled over and let Norris through”. Those comments were then exacerbated by the Red Bull motorsport adviser, Helmut Marko, who said Antonelli had “waved” Norris past. The 19-year-old, who is very friendly with Verstappen, received a swathe of online abuse. He turned his profile picture on Instagram black, while Mercedes identified what they describe as “more than 1,100 severe or suspect” comments, “several of which were death threats” on Antonelli’s social media. The team identified another 330 “severe or suspect” comments on their own social media. The team have reported the incidents to the FIA’s United Against Online Abuse campaign. After the race the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, called the comments “brainless” and “total utter nonsense”. He said he had confronted Lambiase, who had apologised, and on Monday Red Bull issued a statement offering their apologies for provoking the abuse. “Comments made before the end of and immediately after the Qatar GP suggesting that Mercedes driver Kimi Antonelli had deliberately allowed Lando Norris to overtake him are clearly incorrect,” Red Bull said. “Replay footage shows Antonelli momentarily losing control of his car, thus allowing Norris to pass him. We sincerely regret that this has led to Kimi receiving online abuse.”"
sport_2025_dec_01_will-jacks-day-night-ashes-test-england-team-options-cricket.txt,sport,2025-12-01,Ali Martin in Brisbane,Will Jacks in contention for day-night Ashes Test as England ponder options,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/will-jacks-day-night-ashes-test-england-team-options-cricket,"Will Jacks has entered England’s thoughts for the day-night second Test against Australia as they look to level an Ashes series that, after arriving with confidence, is already in danger of slipping away. Jacks was viewed as something of a left-field pick when England named their 16-man squad in September, with the Surrey all-rounder having won the last of his two Test caps during the 3-0 win in Pakistan three years ago and focused chiefly on white-ball cricket since. But the knee injury to Mark Wood has opened up a spot in the XI, with the final call being whether to stick with a five-man pace attack – Josh Tongue next in line, having returned from the Lions match in Canberra – or turn to either Jacks or Shoaib Bashir to provide a spin-bowling option. As England netted under lights on Monday evening, their main twilight session before the series resumes on Thursday, a crowd of about 25 spectators watched as Bashir and Jacks bowled in tandem to Ben Stokes – in what looked like an audition should the latter scenario play out. Jacks in particular bowled for longer than during previous training sessions on this tour, as well as putting in a decent stint working on the batting that could be stationed at No 8 and bolster England’s lineup. If so, then Stokes would be required to bowl more overs as the fourth seamer. Much will hinge on England’s reading of conditions in Brisbane and whether talk of the latest pink Kookaburra ball going softer than its red equivalent means potential periods of attritional cricket. Given the first Test in Perth lasted only two days, with millions of dollars in revenue lost, the Gabba groundstaff may be well wary of setting things up for a repeat. Australia’s record of played 14, won 13 in day-night Test cricket is imperious – a considerable challenge given the current scoreline. But that one defeat in the format took place in Brisbane in January 2024 when West Indies pulled off a shock for the ages. The pace of Shamar Joseph famously stole the show but their off-spinning all-rounder, Kevin Sinclair, also played a role. He scored 64 runs from No 8 across his two innings – vital in an eight-run win – and broke a stand worth 81 during Australia’s first innings by removing Usman Khawaja. With this in mind, the more all-round Jacks could well be the way to go. Though not as quick as Wood, a return for Tongue after his detour to Canberra would maintain the all-out pace approach seen in Perth. Either way, seam is still likely to be the main wicket-taking threat, with Brydon Carse confident he and Jofra Archer can repeat the first‑innings assault that led to Australia being rolled for 132 all out and left nursing some bruises. Speaking before training, Carse said: “I’d like to think there will certainly be moments in this game, and throughout the series, where we can have that sort of impact on the Australian batting lineup. “We have got to take massive amounts of confidence from that first day in Perth. As a group of seamers we all offer different skills and attributes so hopefully we can continue to trouble some of the Australian batters.”"
sport_2025_dec_02_athletics-joining-sports-goliaths-long-way-to-go.txt,sport,2025-12-02,Sean Ingle,‘Your column was very unfair’: what happened when I met World Athletics CEO,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/02/athletics-joining-sports-goliaths-long-way-to-go,"It really is quite the scene. Midnight in Tokyo, Usain Bolt is DJing and the launch party for the World Athletics Ultimate Championships is in full swing. And then the World Athletics chief executive, Jon Ridgeon, walks up to me and says: “I read your recent Guardian column, and I thought it was very unfair.” Imagine Gary Lineker going in two-footed, having never picked up a yellow card in his career. This is the track and field equivalent. Ridgeon, a former world silver medallist over the 110m hurdles, is one of the smartest and most reasonable people in sport. He is saying, in a polite way, that he is really rather annoyed. It’s not that Ridgeon wildly disagrees with my premise that athletics needs to do more to attract gen Z and stay relevant. But he maintains my column is overly negative, skewed towards one side, and doesn’t reflect how much World Athletics has transformed the sport. I enjoy a good debate. So we begin to tease out the arguments and find common ground. At one point Ridgeon graciously admits that some of his friends agree with me more than him. I respond by saying I should have acknowledged World Athletics’ achievements, including the Athletics Integrity Unit to tackle doping. But there is still plenty of meat on the bone when Usain pushes the bass to tinnitus-inducing levels and we have to push our discussion down the road. Last weekend, though, we finally got the chance to thrash things out. Think of it as Ridgeon v Ingle II: this time we can actually hear each other. If I was writing for a 1980s tabloid, a snapper would probably have photographed him planting a boxing glove on my jaw. Instead, after some initial sparring, we get on to why the future is brighter than I suggested a couple of months ago. First, though, Ridgeon wants to get something off his chest. “In your column you quoted a US-based coach and he implied that the sport was slightly asleep and in decline. But on any metric – global television audience, media audience, social media audience, income – it is growing.” Warming to his theme, he says: “Our income’s grown by 25% in the last three or four years. Global cities ring me up to say we want your world championships. And the biggest sporting event in the world in 2025 was our event in Tokyo. I don’t say this complacently, but it says growth, right?” He’s not finished. “And we’re not just sitting passively back going: ‘Gen Z is tough – let’s rely on our middle-aged audience!’” But there is a glint in his eye when Ridgeon talks and explains that World Athletics had 700 million video views on its social media channels at the world championships in September – double that of Budapest two years ago. It is impressive stuff. But my central argument is that, while athletics is certainly incredible at the Olympics and world championships, it needs to do more to attract casual fans the rest of the time. Mondo Duplantis, for instance, can vault over a double‑decker bus with nearly 2 metres to spare. Sabastian Sawe, the London marathon winner, can run 26.2 miles at an average pace of about 4min 40sec a mile. Unless you are up close, it is impossible to envisage how impressive such feats are. Ridgeon agrees and he promises World Athletics will do more to capture the extraordinary. “Television often sanitises those incredible superhuman performances and we need to do more to bring that to life,” he says. “Drone footage, particularly, can unlock new ways of filming things.” Ridgeon, though, insists that World Athletics’ data and research unit, which examines behaviour inside stadiums and when people watch the sport on television, has already led to subtle improvements. They have even wired spectators up to sensors to track their emotional responses when they watch sport. “So do people get sweaty palms when the 100m or when the shot put starts?” Ridgeon asks. “You can probably guess the answer, but it shows we are doing all sorts of stuff. But sometimes it’s a challenging sport to reform. We are a 150-year-old sport.” But the changes are continuing. There will soon be a World Treadmill Championships, designed to make the elite level appeal to more gym-goers. While at next year’s Ultimate Championships, athletes will be allowed to bring their own social media teams to create for their platforms. The idea is to allow athletes to further amplify their personalities to a younger audience – and hopefully also create the rivalries that every sport needs. Ridgeon, however, also acknowledges that more athletes need to realise their competition isn’t just who they line up against. It is also every sport, TV show and activity that competes for eyeballs. Jake Paul v Anthony Joshua is nonsense on multiple levels. But it will sell. Ridgeon remains optimistic, however, despite Grand Slam Track crashing in its first season in the US. And he also cites Nielsen data that suggests one in seven people across the globe like athletics, to suggest its potential is limitless. “But one thing we haven’t been able to do is take that billion people that run round the block to keep fit and to move them across to becoming athletics fans.” So could athletics one day make the quantum leap like Formula One? “We have two groups of sports out there in the world,” he replies. “Football, F1 and those Goliaths that are sucking up more and more of the dollars and the eyeballs. Then you have a lot of traditional, often Olympic sports, that are finding it tough. Athletics is in the middle.” Ridgeon pauses, then decides on a more optimistic tone. “Our foundations are incredible and so we should be able to break into the bottom of that group of Goliaths. We’ve just got to keep the pressure and energy up, and continue that trajectory.” And on that, at least, we firmly agree."

The terrestrial broadcaster is understood to have beaten off rivals to secure a deal that will ensure that all of the home nations matches will be available free-to-air for at least the next three years, in a major boost for the exposure of the sport. ITV already has a joint £63m deal with the BBC for the Six Nations Championship, with the commercial channel having the rights to every England game and 10 of the 15 matches overall as it is paying a greater share of the bill, and once the contracts are signed it will also have exclusive rights for the first two editions of the Nations Championship. The 2027 World Cup in Australia will also be broadcast live on ITV, as it has been since 1991. The Nations Championship deal gives ITV the right to show every game in the new 12-team competition, which features all the Six Nations and their major southern hemisphere rivals – South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Fiji and Japan. Under a new tournament structure announced last month, the Six Nations will tour the southern hemisphere for three Tests in July, with England beginning their campaign against South Africa in Johannesburg, before hosting Australia, Japan and New Zealand in November followed by a final series. As revealed by the Guardian, the first final will be at Twickenham next year before being staged in Qatar in 2028. TNT had been expected to win the Nations Championship rights, as it has broadcast the autumn Tests for the past three years. The Guardian has learned that as incumbent TNT was given first refusal to make a bid but declined, allowing ITV to swoop in. While the asking price was a consideration, sources involved in the discussions have disclosed that the new competition’s format was also a factor. Although the number of games on offer was similar, the autumn internationals take place every year, while the Nations Championship is biennial. It has been a torrid few weeks for TNT, which as revealed by the Guardian lost its UK rights to the Champions League to Paramount+ last month and was outbid by Sky Sports for the Europa League and Uefa Conference League. TNT is broadcasting the Ashes this winter but its coverage from Australia has been widely criticised. ITV’s winning bid will be regarded as a boost for rugby given the finances involved and the exposure provided by free-to-air. Its live coverage of England v France in the Six Nations last February was watched by a peak of 6 million viewers, compared to about 1 million who watched England’s win against New Zealand on TNT last month, which was ITV’s biggest audience since the 2024 European Championship. TNT, which has Gallagher Premexclusive live rights for the Gallagher Prem, is now expected to attempt to rebrand itself as the home for England club rugby in England by reclaiming the Investec Champions Cup from Premier Sports in 2027."

Kicking off on 1 October 2027, the men’s event will feature 24 teams instead of 20, and will be the first to include a round of 16. Each tournament since 2003 has included 20 competing nations, and the previous format moved straight from the pool stage to the quarter-finals. There will be a total of 52 matches in 2027, up from 48. How will 24 teams change the format? Instead of four pools of five there are six pools of four. The eventual winners will still be obliged to play seven matches to claim the trophy, but will play one pool match fewer, before the last-16 game for a place in the last eight. The top two in the six pools qualify for the knockouts, plus the four best third-placed teams. What decides who ends up in which pool? Teams are split into four bands dependent on their world ranking in the draw that takes place at 9am UK time on Wednesday. As hosts, Australia are automatically assigned to Pool A, and will play in the opening game at Perth Stadium, but everything else is up for grabs. What can hosts Australia expect? The Wallabies had a final chance to climb the rankings last month in the autumn internationals: but a winless trip to Europe for Joe Schmidt’s side confirmed their Band 2 status with Scotland, Fiji, Italy, Wales and Japan. The hosts, therefore, are destined to face a powerful Band 1 nation in their pool: one of South Africa, New Zealand, England, Ireland, France or Argentina. Andy Farrell’s Ireland have fallen from second to fourth this year, while England’s 11-match winning streak has seen them climb from seventh to third. What about Scotland and Wales? Scotland’s dramatic recent defeat by the Pumas ended any hope they had of reaching Band 1, while Wales clung on in Band 2 despite losing three out of four autumn internationals, including a 73-0 thrashing by the Springboks last Saturday. A late 24-23 win against Japan in Cardiff on 15 November crucially removed any danger of Wales dropping into Band 3 for the draw and the prospect of a far harder pool. Any dark horses in Bands 3 and 4? Band 3 consists of Georgia, Uruguay, Spain, USA, Chile and Tonga, with Samoa, Portugal, Romania, debutants Hong Kong China, Zimbabwe and Canada in Band 4. Georgia will be the team to avoid in Band 3, ranked 13th, and 14th-ranked Uruguay are traditionally tough opponents, while their South American rivals Chile return after their debut in 2023. One of the most compelling subplots is the potential for Samoa, in Band 4 having squeaked through qualifying – being drawn against Steve Borthwick’s England, which would open the possibility of Manu Tuilagi lining up against his former team. Tuilagi, now playing for Bayonne, will qualify for Samoa early in 2027. Also in Band 4, Portugal’s reappearance will be eagerly anticipated after they lit up the 2023 tournament in France, beating Fiji in dramatic style and drawing with Georgia. Is the draw potentially unfair to some pool winners in the last 16? There are a few wider intricacies to consider. The winners of pools A, B, C and D will meet a third-place team in the round of 16, while the winners of pools E and F will play a side that finished second in their pool. “While on the surface that may seem slightly unfair, that imbalance is addressed in the next round,” World Rugby states. “The team that wins Pool A will face a third-place team in the Round of 16, but in the quarter-finals could potentially meet the winner of Pool B if that team wins their round of 16 match.” The winners of Pool E and Pool F will, in theory, have a harder task in the last 16, but cannot face a pool winner until the semi-finals. Will the draw change the favourites to win the World Cup? The dominant form of South Africa, winners of the past two men’s tournaments, makes them strongly fancied to win a third straight title although Borthwick’s England, if they continue on an upward curve, will be confident of a deep run. Much will change between now and 2027 but the favourites can start planning in earnest once the draw is made."
sport_2025_dec_02_mike-tomlin-says-pittsburgh-steelers-fans-are-right-to-boo-his-team.txt,sport,2025-12-02,Guardian sport,Mike Tomlin says Pittsburgh Steelers fans are right to boo his team,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/02/mike-tomlin-says-pittsburgh-steelers-fans-are-right-to-boo-his-team,"Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin says fans who booed the team during their 26-7 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday are in the right. “In general, I agree with them, from this perspective: Football is our game, we’re in a sport entertainment business,” Tomlin said Tuesday. “And so if you root for the Steelers, entertaining them is winning. And so when you’re not winning, it’s not entertaining.” The Steelers are tied at the top of the AFC North and have never endured a losing campaign in Tomlin’s 18 full seasons in charge. However, they gave up 249 rushing yards in their loss to the Bills and some fans could be heard calling for Tomlin to be fired. There are problems on the other side of the ball too, with quarterback Aaron Rodgers saying that he was “disappointed in the offensive performance” against the Bills. “If you’ve been in this business, you understand that, and so I respect it,” Tomlin said. “I share frustrations, I understand what makes this thing go, and winning is what makes this thing go.” The Steelers also gave up sloppy penalties and defensive captain Cam Heyward was involved in a confrontation with Bills quarterback Josh Allen. “I own the responsibility of making sure that these guys understand a component of being a tough team to beat is not beating ourselves,” Tomlin said. “We had some penalties and certainly you’re going to have penalties when you play. But penalties of the 15-yard variety, loss of composure and things of that nature hadn’t been us. And so that needs to be corrected immediately.” While the Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens both have 6-6 records at the top of the AFC North, the Ravens edge the tiebreaker on points differential and have a significantly easier run-in. The teams play each other twice before the end of the season – the first meeting is this coming Sunday – and most prediction models have the Ravens as favorites to take the division. The Steelers are also 6-11 over their last 17 games going back to last season. “Certainly our last performance wasn’t up to snuff [on Sunday], but I don’t know that it lessens our belief in self or our ability to deliver individually and collectively moving forward,” Tomlin said. While Tomlin has consistently led the Steelers to the playoffs – and won the Super Bowl in the 2008 season – their last postseason victory came in January 2017."
sport_2025_dec_02_oscar-piastri-mclaren-f1-world-title-abu-dhabi-chances.txt,sport,2025-12-02,Jack Snape,Win in Abu Dhabi and hope for chaos: how Oscar Piastri can still win the F1 world title,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/02/oscar-piastri-mclaren-f1-world-title-abu-dhabi-chances,"If Oscar Piastri is going to break through for Australia’s first Formula One driver title in 45 years, it’s going to be the hard way. The McLaren driver enters this weekend’s final round in Abu Dhabi trailing teammate Lando Norris and Red Bull’s four-time reigning champion Max Verstappen in the standings. The 24-year-old has had to overcome a curse from a fast food chain and dubious enforcement of the so-called papaya rules just to stay in the mix for the title, and his team were to blame for a strategy error that cost him victory last weekend in Qatar. But a window for Piastri remains open, however narrow, for what would be one of the most unlikely final-round championship comebacks in Formula One history. Already 2025 is the first season to have three or more drivers still in the title race heading into the final round since 2010, when Sebastian Vettel secured his first of four titles. That year Mark Webber – now coincidentally Piastri’s manager – and Fernando Alonso were the top-ranked drivers entering the final round, but finished well behind Vettel, who made up a 15-point deficit to clinch a memorable championship. Piastri is currently 16 points behind Norris, and four behind Verstappen, and needs to finish first or second simply to earn enough points to eclipse Norris’s total heading into the race. Then he needs to rely on his McLaren colleague and Verstappen underperforming or failing to finish. A Piastri victory would be enough for him to claim the driver’s title as long as Norris finishes no better than sixth. Second place for the Australian would have his title aspirations relying on an even more improbable set of results. Norris has placed below sixth only four times this season. He failed to finish in Canada after a collision with Piastri, and in the Netherlands due to a late oil leak. The Bristol-born driver was also disqualified alongside his teammate in Las Vegas due to excessive wear on the underside of the car. Verstappen looms as an even more imposing challenger, given he has won five of the past eight rounds to surge into championship contention. He also has form in Abu Dhabi, having won four successive races there from 2020. That run of dominance in the UAE only ended last year during a race marred by a first corner incident. Verstappen clipped Piastri, sending him into a spin that pushed him to the back of the pack in a miserable day that ended in 10th position. The contact also saw the Dutch driver tumble down the order, before he finished sixth behind runaway leader Norris. A similar degree of carnage, or some Sonny Hayes-like help, appears to be the only path left for a Piastri championship."
sport_2025_dec_02_robin-smith-england-hampshire-cricket-tribute.txt,sport,2025-12-02,Tanya Aldred,Fearless Robin Smith and his square cuts gave hope to England in grim era,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/02/robin-smith-england-hampshire-cricket-tribute,"A Robin Smith square cut was more than a whip‑crack snap of the bat. For English cricket fans of the late 80s and early 90s, it was a nudge in the ribs that, underneath the pastings, the dismal collapses and Rentaghost selections, the national team would fight another day. Smith’s cut, alongside a David Gower cover drive, gave hope where there was little left in the bucket. Those famous forearms – half oak, half baobab – the white shirt unbuttoned past the clavicle, the chain glinting through his chest hair, smelt enticingly like bravery, and old spice and one last throw of the dice. The sight of Smith marching out to bat – as an opener (in four Tests), No 3 (six), No 4 (30), No 5 (19), No 6 (14) or No 7 (twice) – those charmingly indecisive selectors never could quite place him – was a high point in a largely post-Botham era, a clear-the-bars alarm for those in the ground and a stay‑your‑ground sign to those on the sofa. Like fellow South Africans Tony Greig and Allan Lamb before him and Kevin Pietersen after him, Smith was bigger and better and more sexy than his Test average – which, incidentally, was a healthy 43.67 – second only to Graham Gooch among English batters during the period of his Test career. He was utterly fearless in the face of extreme pace, beyond any expectation, as fast bowlers reared up at meeting their match and came harder. Watch the highlights of him batting against Ian Bishop at Edgbaston in 1995, just six months before he played his final Test. Bishop is relentless, skilful, brutal – and Smith, with barely a flinch, takes blows on the elbow, the shoulder, the rump, but he evades even more. Dainty back bends, swaying leather-sniffing, dinky knee drops, all were part of his back catalogue long before yoga and pilates were the staple of a sportsman’s daily routine. Smith hit 41 in England’s second innings of 89 all out in that match – opening because Alec Stewart couldn’t bat after injuring a finger behind the stumps on a pitch that the captain Mike Atherton said later was the worst he had encountered in any Test. Atherton also told everyone that Smith’s 41 would have been worth a hundred had it been made anywhere else. Smith made his England debut in 1988, dropped into an England team in disarray during the famous summer of the four captains. Chris Cowdrey was his captain for that match – and would never play for England again. But Smith took it all in his stride and the next year scorched two hundreds and a 96 during the 4-0 thrashing by Australia in England. Of all his nine Test centuries, two stick most memorably in the mind. His 101 in the fifth Ashes Test at Trent Bridge that dismal 1989 summer, after Australia had racked up 602 for six declared, and Smith had stormed in with the score one for two – Martyn Moxon and Atherton back in the pavilion for ducks. He ravaged the Australians, those square cuts screaming across the Nottingham grass and you can sense the joy in the crowd that someone, at last, is giving them something to cheer at, a stick of some sort to wave at the gimlet-eyed baggy greens. I don’t think that, even in this Indian Premier League era, anyone has cut the ball harder. And his 175 against the West Indies at St Johns in April 1994 – an almost forgotten innings as it came in the same match as Brian Lara grabbed the headlines with 375. But against Curtly Ambrose, and Courtney Walsh, it was an innings of pure-gold defiance. Maybe England players seemed more human to us then because we could see their faces when they undertook the cruel business of batting. We could smell their fear and see the frustration in their eyes. Smith would wear a cap when he could, otherwise his helmet was without bars or visor, balanced on that famous hair, which panned behind him in a series of shampoo‑and-set waves. In the end, it turned out that the larger-than-life cricketer and the cavalier cape didn’t match the vulnerable human underneath. His autobiography The Judge, written with Rob Smyth, revealed the loneliness and sadness behind those big-man strokes, and the bereft figure left once cricket had decided he was no longer needed. “The Judge was a fearless warrior,” he wrote. “Robin Arnold Smith was a frantic worrier.” I hope he knew how much we all loved him."
sport_2025_dec_02_robin-smith-former-england-cricketer-dies-aged-62.txt,sport,2025-12-02,Sean Ingle,"‘He was a batter ahead of his time’: Robin Smith, former England cricketer, dies aged 62",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/02/robin-smith-former-england-cricketer-dies-aged-62,"Tributes have been paid to Robin Smith, whose swashbuckling batting and fearlessness at the crease lit up English cricket in an era when it often languished in the doldrums, following his death at the age of 62. Smith played 62 Tests for England between 1988 and 1996, averaging 43.67. But it was the sight of him taking the fight to the fastest pace bowlers of his generation that will live longest in the memory. His highest Test score of 175, against West Indies in Antigua in 1994, came against a bowling attack led by Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, who took 924 Test wickets between them. Yet, in the same game that Brian Lara hit a Test record score of 375, the majestic Smith smashed 26 fours and three sixes. His best year came in 1991, when he scored 675 runs at an average of 67.5 and hit a brilliant 148 against West Indies. One of his England teammates, Mark Ramprakash, told the Guardian that while Smith was a phenomenal batter, he was an even better person and teammate. “There’s his cricket, the way he played as a batsman, which was to be hugely admired in an era of great fast bowlers,” Ramprakash said. “And then there’s the person, who was more admirable still. “On my England debut in 1991 I was 21, and I’ll never forget how kind he was in welcoming me into the dressing room, the warmth of his personality. He was someone who enjoyed life. “Life was not a rehearsal for him, he went out and lived it. He mixed freely with anybody and was very popular, very well liked. “Then we come to his batting. His skill and bravery in facing fast bowling was second to none and elevated him to No 1 in the world in my eyes. That year, 1991, he played some fantastic innings against West Indies, who had at the time the best fast‑bowling attack in the world. He got a big century at Lord’s and another at the Oval, and the way he stood up to that attack was fabulous. “I remember at Lord’s he came off having scored an unbeaten 148 on a tricky wicket, covered with bruises all over his body. But he just brushed it off, and accepted it was just part of playing fast bowling.” Smith retired from first-class cricket with more than 26,000 first‑class runs to his name, including 61 hundreds, and moved to Perth in Australia. But he increasingly struggled with alcoholism and his mental health, and last year spent seven months in hospital with cirrhosis of the liver after more than a decade drinking a bottle of vodka a day. Only two weeks ago, Smith met the England Lions squad during their tour match at Lilac Hill in Perth following an invitation from Andrew Flintoff, offering advice on international cricket and telling players stories of his own career for more than an hour. He also spoke to the media about his struggles since retiring from cricket. However, his family urged people not to second‑guess his cause of death. In a statement, the family said: “It is with the deepest and most profound sense of sadness and loss that we must announce the passing of Robin Arnold Smith, beloved father of Harrison and Margaux and cherished brother of Christopher. Robin died unexpectedly at his South Perth apartment on Monday 1 December. The cause of his death is at present unknown. “Since his retirement from the game in 2004 his battles with alcohol and mental health have been well documented but these should not form the basis of speculation about the cause of death which will be determined at postmortem investigation.” Smith, who was known as “the Judge” because his thick wiry hairy resembled a judge’s wig, was also a stalwart in England’s one-day team, playing in 71 internationals including the 1992 World Cup final. Richard Thompson, the England &amp; Wales Cricket Board chair, said in a tribute that Smith was a “batter ahead of his time”. Thompson said: “Robin Smith was a player who stood toe to toe with some of the quickest bowlers around, meeting spells of hostile fast bowling with a defiant smile and a ferocious shot. He did so in a way that gave England fans enormous pride, and no shortage of entertainment. “He was a batter ahead of his time which was typified in that unforgettable unbeaten 167 from 163 balls in an ODI against Australia at Edgbaston in 1993.” There were also tributes from Hampshire, the county he helped to secure Benson &amp; Hedges Cup victories in 1988 and 1992 and the NatWest Trophy in 1991. “Robin embodied the spirit of Hampshire,” the club’s chief executive, Rod Bransgrove, said. “He loved playing for his county. The Judge connected with everyone he came into contact with. He was one of the most popular players ever to play the game we all love.” That sentiment was echoed by a former teammate, Kevan James. “He was a super player, particularly of fast bowling in an era where the West Indies had all these fast bowlers,” James said. “He was one of the few England batters who stood up to them and basically gave as good as he got.”"
sport_2025_dec_02_robin-smith-obituary.txt,sport,2025-12-02,Derek Pringle,Robin Smith obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/02/robin-smith-obituary,"In the eras before the Twenty20 format nobody hit a cricket ball harder than Robin Smith. Muscled like a prizefighter but with quick feet inherited from his ballet dancer mother, he produced strokes, the square cut especially, with a force that left dents in boundary boards and opponents’ ambitions. His wicket was highly sought after, for teams knew they were in for a hand-wringing experience, in all senses, should he spend any time at the crease. But Smith, who has died aged 62 after a long period of ill-health, was a mass of contradictions. On the face of it he was a courageous, attacking batter famed for thrilling encounters with fast bowlers, yet behind the bravado was a highly insecure person who constantly questioned his worth. Having kept this well hidden during his playing days, he later suffered from alcoholism and depression. Smith’s bravery against the quicks could not be faked. How much was guts, though, and how much thrill-seeking necessity was questionable, for he was a self-confessed adrenaline junkie. His courage led many close to him to wonder whether he was wired differently from most, craving as he did the masochistic experience of facing express pace with its twin demands for lightning reflexes and a high pain threshold – qualities encapsulated perfectly in the unbeaten 148 he made against West Indies at Lord’s in 1991, a Test innings many consider his finest for England despite the game sputtering to a draw. Curtly Ambrose and Malcolm Marshall, two of cricket’s greatest fast bowlers, were rampant during that innings, and in tricky conditions. While others wilted, Smith rose to the challenge, his eyes sparkling with glee as he and the bowlers traded body blows and boundaries. He later admitted the experience left him “tingling”, a feeling that had intensified to agony four years later at Old Trafford, when a similar onslaught from much the same bowling attack left him with a badly smashed cheekbone. Batting mostly in the middle order, Smith played 62 Tests and 71 one-day internationals for England during an international career that ran from 1988 to 1996. In that time he scored 4,236 Test runs with nine hundreds, with an average of 43.67, and 2,419 one-day runs at an average of just under 40. In 1993, at Edgbaston, 167 of those one-day runs came against Australia in one of the most brutal innings ever seen, one that saw him personally congratulated by the prime minister, John Major. Yet, in a pattern that was to dog many of his personal highs for England, he failed to finish on the winning side. Nicknamed the Judge after an early hairstyle resembling a judge’s wig, his Test batting average, in an era when England lost twice as many matches as they won, was impressive. Many felt he was passed over too quickly by selectors when he has dropped following a fractious tour of South Africa in 1995-96. Critics, though, pointed to the fact that his game never evolved, his vulnerability to spin a constant throughout his career. Unfailingly loyal to team and friends, he took any form of rejection hard – to the point where he often saw it as betrayal. In his ghosted autobiography, The Judge (2020), he admitted to being two people at the same time: the Judge was a tough, arrogant competitor set on humiliating bowlers and who thrived on conflict, while Robin Smith was a gentle, emotional character. Each suppressed the other to certain degrees. Smith managed to fall out with important figures, including the England coach Keith Fletcher, who did not take kindly to Smith asking him to employ the services of a sports psychologist. During an era when the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist was perhaps not as clear in cricket circles as it was on the couches of California, Fletcher’s take was that “if you need a psychiatrist you shouldn’t be playing for England”. On one occasion his unwavering loyalty cost him game time after he stood up for Marshall, a teammate at Hampshire who hailed from Barbados. The pair had been sitting at the bar in the team’s hotel in Leicester when three men began to level racist abuse at Marshall. Smith asked them to stop, but when they persisted he knocked down the ring leader with a single punch. The blow broke his hand, leading to a six-week absence from cricket, though he escaped any formal punishment. Smith played before central contracts protected leading players from burnout, a situation that persuaded many England stars to shift their priorities from county to country, but not him. He played for Hampshire from 1982 to 2003, with five seasons as captain from 1998, and scored 18,984 first-class runs for the county at an average of 42.02, with 49 hundreds. His desire for a challenge meant he often saved his best for big games or dire situations. Mark Nicholas, the county’s captain for the first half of Smith’s career, reckoned him to be Hampshire’s greatest ever player. Born in Durban, South Africa, Robin was the second son of John Smith, a leather merchant, and Joy (nee Shearer), a ballerina and dance teacher. He attended Northlands boys high school, which he left just before his 17th birthday. The family lived in the Durban suburb of La Lucia, where a cricket net was installed for Robin and his elder brother, Chris, to hone their game. Most days the boys would be roused by their father at 5am when the bowling machine, along with David the gardener, would be cranked into action for the next two hours. A hearty breakfast cooked by the family’s African maid, Florence, would follow, then school. It was undeniably a life of white privilege, even in apartheid South Africa. Both he and Chris played first-class cricket for Natal in the Currie Cup, Robin as a teenager. When Chris joined Hampshire in 1980, Robin followed soon after. Initially the pair joined as overseas players before becoming English-qualified due to their parents being British born. Chris was picked for England first, playing eight Tests and four one-day internationals in 1983-84. There was no cricketing rivalry between the two of them, though they did bicker about who had the best Porsche. For those who knew both of them, Chris had the steel and Robin the talent, something they also knew. In a team game such as cricket there is another hurdle to be negotiated even after you have made it; a second life in civvy street away from the team that enveloped you and treated you as family. For Robin that big shift occurred in 2003 when, a month shy of his 40th birthday, Hampshire told him they would not renew his contract. A realist would have seen it coming but Smith had never been one of them, and it hit hard. He had already set up several businesses during his playing days; Judge Tours, a travel company; Chase Sports, a bat manufacturer; Masuri helmets; and now with the help of outside investors he added another, a wine bar bearing his name in Romsey. Profit and loss did not stir the adrenaline like cricket, and he lost control of each. A man who had always partied as hard as he played, he turned to drink. Eventually a failed property deal, which left him with serious debts, spurred him to emigrate to Australia. His 1988 marriage to Kath James also came under strain, not least from his affairs. The move to Perth in 2007 with their two children, Harrison and Margaux, did not fix their problems, and divorce followed in 2010. By then his parents, along with Chris and his family, had already settled in Perth. They all tried to help, Chris by giving him a job at his embroidery factory. But a year later Smith contemplated taking his own his life. He was talked out of his “black hole”, as he described his depression, by his son and by Karin Lwin, a neighbour. Her empathy slowly persuaded him that he was a “good man with a bad problem”. A return to coaching proved to be better rehab than the clinic he had attended, while his ghosted autobiography proved cathartic. But his problems persisted. He is survived by Karin, his two children and his brother, Chris. • Robin Arnold Smith, cricketer and businessman, born 13 September 1963; died 2 December 2025"
sport_2025_dec_02_rugb-union-breakdown-thirty-years-of-the-champions-cup.txt,sport,2025-12-02,Robert Kitson,"Thirty years of Champions Cup has given us the beastly, beautiful and bizarre",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/02/rugb-union-breakdown-thirty-years-of-the-champions-cup,"On the eve of a new Champions Cup season it is worth remembering when and where it all began. The answer is 30 years ago on the shores of the Black Sea where Farul Constanta of Romania hosted France’s mighty Toulouse in the opening pool game of the old Heineken Cup on 31 October 1995. Let’s just say they were different times. The match was played on a Tuesday and, while the crowd was recorded as 3,000, eyewitnesses were focused on the large number of security personnel with barking Alsatian dogs straining at the leash. Toulouse, boasting an array of internationals including Émile Ntamack and Thomas Castaignède, duly registered eight tries and won 54-10. Only one British media representative – the late, great Terry Godwin – was in attendance while the Welsh referee, Robert Davies, recalled passing numerous donkey-drawn carts on the five-hour minibus journey back to Bucharest. “Every now and then the curtain would pull back on a cart and a child would shine a torch our way,” Davies subsequently told the Western Mail. The evening function also proved to be an eye-opener. With Toulouse having to rush off to catch a charter flight home, the remaining five-strong group of match officials and tournament reps were taken out and entertained by dancers, magicians and singers in an otherwise thinly populated nightclub. “At one point several ‘ladies of the night’ appeared but, as they used to say in the newspapers, we made our excuses and left,” recounted Davies. From small acorns and all that. It was certainly the start of a tantalising new era for the European club game. In that first season – Toulouse were duly crowned champions – England and Scotland were not represented, having declined to compete for varying reasons. Both, however, were involved the following year when Brive, fizzing with power and pace and captained by Alain Penaud, Damian’s dad, shredded Leicester in the final in Cardiff. It is just one of a kaleidoscope of searing memories from a tournament that, at its best, had everything. Some of the cross-border battles in the early years were scarily intense, notably when Pontypridd went over to play the aforementioned Brive in an ill-tempered contest in 1997 during which a player from each side was sent off after a mass brawl. The niggle then erupted again that evening in Bar Le Toulzac amid wild west scenes of flying chairs and fists. But amid the beastly stuff there has been much beauty, too. Four of the most compelling sporting events your correspondent has ever attended all involved Munster at various stages in their pursuit of their European holy grail. Stitch together the breathless 31-25 semi-final win over Toulouse on a roasting hot day in Bordeaux’s Stade Chaban-Delmas in 2000, the “Miracle Match” against Gloucester in Limerick in 2003, the barely believable 37-32 semi-final win for Wasps in Dublin the following season and the 30-6 semi-final drubbing of Leinster in 2006 and Munster’s contribution to European history is impossible to overlook. The best side ever to lift the trophy? Probably a split decision between the brilliant Toulon side who won successive titles in 2013 and 2014 and the modern Toulouse juggernaut with Antoine Dupont at the wheel. For sheer showpiece excitement you also have to credit Leicester, Leinster and Exeter Chiefs for winning quite extraordinarily vivid final games in, respectively, 2001, 2011 and 2020. But maybe what truly elevated the tournament were the dramatic eccentricities – some of them beyond bizarre – that have entered rugby folklore. Remember, for example, the deflected drop goal off a Llanelli player by Elton Moncrieff that earned Gloucester a 28-27 pool win in 2001. “When a drop goal hits someone on the arse and bounces over how do you blame yourself for that?” sighed Llanelli’s frustrated coach, Gareth Jenkins, afterwards. The Breakdown was also present earlier the same season when Wasps’ Richard Birkett, leaping up to try to intercept a long-range penalty attempt by Diego Domínguez at Loftus Road, inadvertently knocked the ball over the bar to help Stade Français win by three points. Then – move over Scott McTominay – there was Geordan Murphy’s overhead kick for Leicester against Swansea that narrowly failed to yield the ultimate crowd-pleasing try at Welford Road, again in 2001. Not to mention Tim Stimpson’s kick from another postcode that bounced off bar and post from fully 60 metres out to win the Tigers a semi-final at Nottingham’s City Ground in 2002, again at Llanelli’s expense. From Bloodgate to the “Hand of Back” to the gripping 2009 semi-final penalty shootout in Cardiff there was, for years, no other tournament like it. What a pity, then, that its allure is in some danger of diminishing as it enters its fourth decade. Whether it is the amended format – six pools of four teams with two second-place “fastest losers” meant every single point truly mattered and connected every fixture – or familiarity or the seeding minutiae that gave certain teams crucial home knockout advantage, the pool stages have not had the same frisson. It would also be nice if a wider spread of European nations were involved. Beyond the South African sides plus Black Lion from Georgia in the Challenge Cup, it is otherwise the same old Six Nations suspects.

sport_2025_dec_02_second-ashes-test-brisbane-england-team-cricket-will-jacks.txt,sport,2025-12-02,Simon Burnton in Brisbane,England abandon all-out pace attack with recall of Will Jacks for second Ashes Test in Brisbane,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/02/second-ashes-test-brisbane-england-team-cricket-will-jacks,"Will Jacks will make his third Test appearance, his first in nearly three years, as England attempt to level the Ashes at the Gabba from Thursday . He replaces the injured Mark Wood in the only change to the team that lost the series opener in Perth. With this selection the tourists are abandoning the all-out pace attack that bundled Australia out for 132 in their first innings of the opening Test – and was then pummelled by Travis Head in their second – in favour of deepening their batting lineup and adding a spin-bowling option. The decision followed analysis of recent day-night games, including the role Nathan Lyon has played in his pink-ball outings as well as Kevin Sinclair’s success for West Indies when they became the first and only team to beat Australia in a floodlit match, in Brisbane at the start of last year. Shoaib Bashir is established as England’s preferred spinner, and has played 19 Tests since Jacks was last picked, but he is a lesser batter and less reliable in the field. The 27-year-old Jacks’s selection means Jofra Archer is the only member of the England team not to have scored a first-class hundred. England made their selection having trained under floodlights with the pink ball for the first time on Monday night, noting how early it gets dark in Brisbane – a 6.30pm sunset on Tuesday was an hour and a quarter earlier than that in Adelaide, the more regular venue for Australia’s day-night games. “You sort of feel like there’s more time under ‘false light’ than maybe other places where you play day-night cricket,” Stokes said. Having admitted there were periods in the first Test when he “could have been a lot better as captain”, Stokes is expecting an even more searching test of his leadership at the Gabba. “There’s so many more tactical decisions that go into day-night cricket than a normal Test match,” he said. “It’s commonly known that the ball is at its peak of difficulty when those lights do come on, so you have to think a lot more tactically when you make decisions. And the night period when the lights are on, there’s a lot more to think about. It’s just a completely different thing to think about as a captain.” The Queensland climate has also fed into England’s thinking, though the forecast for the first few days of the Test – with temperatures hovering around 28C (82F) – is less extreme than what they have trained in. “The humidity is very high here – you step out in the sunlight and just start sweating,” Stokes said. “Something we’ve spoken about is being very conscious of keeping that ball as dry as we can, because as soon as the pink Kookaburra goes soft it’s going to be a lot harder to feel like you can make a breakthrough. All those tiny little things we’ve had to consider. I think our liaison officers got tasked with going out and buying about 60 sweatbands for all of us.” England have again found themselves on the news pages of Australian papers, after several players were photographed riding motorised scooters without wearing the helmets mandated in Queensland, but are refusing to be cowed by overwhelming media attention into hunkering down in their hotel. “It’s not unexpected,” Stokes said. “It’s one of those things. We felt it when we got here – there were cameras in front of the hotel from 8am, following us on the golf course, and even when we went out for some lunch. They’re just there. I don’t know what the reason is for that. “If they think it is going to stop us enjoying this country when we have time off, it is not going to do that. Australia is the best country to tour, there are so many things to do. One of the important things on tour when under pressure is to go out, free your mind, enjoy yourself, and whatever is going on in that kind of world, let it be. We are human. We need to enjoy countries when we get the opportunity because we live in England where it is miserable, freezing cold and dark at 4pm.” Ollie Pope said he had been aware of it in the days after England lost the first Test. “[It was] everywhere you went, when the guys were trying to unwind,” he said. “For us as cricketers and as people it’s important to be able to switch off and be yourself. If we lose a game like we did and everyone’s gutted, locking your doors and not coming out of your room is the unhealthy thing to do, as we saw in Covid times. “It’s different, but whatever you’re doing in your off time, just taking your mind away from cricket, that’s really important. If they want to catch us doing that then so be it.”"
sport_2025_dec_02_serena-williams-comeback-itia-testing-pool-whereabouts.txt,sport,2025-12-02,Bryan Armen Graham,Serena Williams quietly re-enters drug-testing pool in step toward possible 2026 return,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/02/serena-williams-comeback-itia-testing-pool-whereabouts,"Serena Williams has taken the procedural move required of any player contemplating a competitive comeback, after the 23-time grand slam singles champion re-entered the International Tennis Integrity Agency’s (ITIA) registered testing pool for the first time since 2022. Williams, 44, has not played an official match since her run to the third round of the US Open more than three years ago. Although she described her departure at the time as “evolving away” from the sport rather than a hard retirement, she filed the paperwork with the ITIA that September that exempted her from the sport’s stringent whereabouts requirements. To return to competition, however, players must make themselves available for out-of-competition testing for six months before they are allowed to enter an event. Williams’s name appeared on the agency’s updated testing-pool list dated 6 October. An ITIA spokesperson confirmed to the Guardian on Tuesday that Williams had requested reinstatement, while emphasizing that a place on the list was not itself evidence of a comeback. “Serena Williams is back on the Registered Testing Pool list,” an ITIA spokesperson said, noting that athletes returning from retirement “need to make themselves available for testing for six months before they can compete again”, in line with World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) regulations. Later on Tuesday, Williams publicly disputed that her inclusion in the pool signaled any plans to return. “Omg yall I’m NOT coming back,” she wrote on X. “This wildfire is crazy.” A representative for Williams did not immediately respond to questions from the Guardian about her intentions. The ITIA’s registered pool does not include every active player; it is largely reserved for top-ranked singles competitors, high-level doubles and wheelchair athletes, and pros coming back after extended absences. Rumors about a possible cameo appearance at the US Open circulated quietly during this year’s tournament, particularly around the mixed doubles event, which has evolved into a two-day showcase packed with star wildcards. But because Williams remained classified as retired at the time, she was not eligible to enter. People familiar with the process have told the Guardian that Williams explored a return earlier than this autumn. One attempt to rejoin the testing pool was made in August, just before the US Open, most likely with the hope of playing doubles alongside her sister Venus. Those plans dissipated once it became clear that the six-month testing window could not be waived, a restriction that blocked Andy Roddick from a similar last-minute doubles cameo in 2014. Venus Williams, 45, never formally retired and therefore avoided the same procedural hurdles. She returned this summer after a 16-month break, earning a singles win in Washington, pushing No 11 seed Karolína Muchová to a deciding set in New York and reaching the US Open doubles quarter-finals with Leylah Fernandez. She is expected to resume her schedule in Auckland early next season. Serena’s reappearance on the ITIA documents does not guarantee a comeback, but it does restore her eligibility timeline. If she remains in the pool without interruption, she could enter tournaments as early as mid-2026. Whether she intends to contest singles again, reunite with Venus in doubles, or simply preserve the option to do so remains uncertain."
sport_2025_dec_02_strengthened-australia-welcome-england-to-gabbatoir-in-pivotal-ashes-week-cricket.txt,sport,2025-12-02,Ali Martin in Brisbane,Strengthened Australia welcome England to Gabbatoir in pivotal Ashes week,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/02/strengthened-australia-welcome-england-to-gabbatoir-in-pivotal-ashes-week-cricket,"My first day at the Gabba was 23 years ago, half a lifetime having passed since I slept on my brother’s sofa across the river and followed the Ashes tour as a backpacker. The coin went up, Nasser Hussain decided to have a bowl, and Steve Waugh’s Australians cashed in on generosity. Having not returned until 2017‑18, and then covered the Covid tour four years later, the Sydney finale in 2003 remains the only time I have seen England win a Test on Australian soil. Even then I missed the last day: flat broke and forced to head back to Queensland to find work, I eventually found myself on a farm upstate, shovelling melons like a scrum-half for eight hot hours a day while dodging venomous snakes underfoot. It was three dollars to the pound back then, but the main difference before the tour started was expectation. There was precious little, other than of a good time ahead, a chance to watch that great Australia team first hand, and the hope that one or two Englishmen might stand up in the heat. Michael Vaughan’s glowing bat answered that call, at least, peeling off 633 princely runs in an otherwise one‑sided 4–1 defeat. Australians could be forgiven for wondering why expectations were higher this time around given England’s record since. The 3–1 win under Andrew Strauss in 2010-11 remains the one island of bliss in an ocean of otherwise thwarted trips, with two whitewashes and a couple of 4–0 scorelines underlining how hard it can be to swim against the tide. Optimism came chiefly from England’s fast-bowling stocks and a positive outlook, plus an Australia side deemed to be approaching its end. But a two‑day bunfight in Perth – one that hinged ultimately on an hour of ruinous batting – paused all that talk, triggering a wave of derision towards England and sending them into must‑win territory at the Gabba this week. Mathematically this is not true, of course, but those who cover Ashes tours are hard-wired with one particular statistic above all: no team have overcome a 2–0 deficit to win a series bar Australia in 1936-37. And they had a certain Don Bradman leading the fightback with scores of 270, 212 and 169 across the final three Tests. Ben Stokes tends to reject the relevance of history which, at a ground such as the Gabba – an unconquerable citadel for England for nearly 40 years – is probably for the best. Although tactical tidbits from previous “Gabbatoir” ordeals go slightly out of the window anyway, with the second Test that starts on Thursday a first Ashes day‑nighter on Vulture Street. A sport already built on myriad variables gets a whole heap more when the pink Kookaburra ball comes out to play. It can zip around in the day – India were rolled for 36 in bright Adelaide sunshine five years ago – and it can also go soft, forcing fielding sides to sit in. But even when tired, it can still suddenly burst into life before bedtime – the so-called “witching hour” that readers with young children will doubtless recognise. All this led to the floodlit format recently being dubbed “a lottery” by Stuart Broad but Australia’s record of played 14, won 13 suggests otherwise. Notwithstanding Mitchell Starc’s pink-ball pre‑eminence and greater exposure for their batters, it still comes down to deft in‑game management, an appreciation of conditions, and superior split‑second decision making. Given events on the second and, ahem, final day in Perth, these challenges will likely be of greater concern for England’s supporters than the Gabba factor itself. On Tuesday, before training, Stokes doubled down on a belief that his players have the wherewithal to get it right in the moment. This may induce eyes being rolled but the one day-night Test Stokes has overseen is the 267‑run victory against New Zealand in Mount Maunganui in 2023. There was a smart declaration on day one and, for all the talk of one‑dimensional batting, an even smarter slowdown on day three that allowed Broad to wreak havoc with a new ball under lights. The seamers are likely to dominate here – Jofra Archer has looked a nightmare to face under lights – but Stokes has one fewer in his quiver than last week, bringing Will Jacks in for the injured Mark Wood. With the humidity high, passages of attrition possible, and the quick men likely to need breathers, the option of a spinner does seem reasonable enough. The question in the short term is whether Jacks, a serviceable part‑timer who also bolsters the batting, can give Stokes the desired control. The broader one is what this all means for Shoaib Bashir, who after two years of investment with this very tour in mind has been leapfrogged by a wildcard pick. Australia’s one enforced change is Usman Khawaja making way with the back issue that blighted him in Perth. While Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood are still out – Cummins has been in Brisbane, amid whispers of a possible late surprise – the hosts appear stronger for the loss of Khawaja, not least if the dangerous Josh Inglis comes into the middle order. It all adds up to a pivotal week for the tour and this England team. The melon fields of north Queensland are unlikely to follow but, given what 2–0 down would mean, their only option is to go for broke."
sport_2025_dec_02_we-make-a-great-living-emma-raducanu-on-why-she-wont-moan-about-the-tennis-calendar.txt,sport,2025-12-02,Tumaini Carayol,‘We make a great living’: Emma Raducanu on why she won’t moan about the tennis calendar,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/02/we-make-a-great-living-emma-raducanu-on-why-she-wont-moan-about-the-tennis-calendar,"Emma Raducanu has garnered many endorsement deals in her nascent career, but there is perhaps one elusive sponsorship that would be most pleasing to the British No 1 women’s tennis player: ambassador of the London borough of Bromley. During a roundtable discussion with tennis journalists at the end of a gruelling yet satisfying season, Raducanu is merely attempting to describe a quiet off-season spent in her family home when she finds herself delivering a sales pitch about the benefits of living in Bromley. “I’m just so settled,” she says. “I’ve barely been in the UK this year because I’ve been competing so much, but I think just spending really good quality time with my parents has been so nice. I have loved just being in Bromley. It just reminds me of when I was a younger kid and it’s the same bedroom, same everything. “Bromley has some amazing speciality coffee shops now that didn’t exist a few years ago. And I’ve been trying every new spot. It’s been really nice, and obviously so much greenery, and it’s been fun actually. I’ve been commuting on the train. So I’ve been part of rush hour every day, which has also been an experience. But it’s like my switch off. As soon as I get on the South Western to Waterloo, I’m just like: ‘My day is done now.’” The inner peace and contentment that Raducanu speaks of has been hard‑earned at the end of a positive if unspectacular season when she took several steps forward. The 23‑year‑old rose from outside the top 60 to No 29 in 2025, her highest ranking since 2022. She played more frequently than ever this year with largely consistent results. She has also taken steps to find stability within her team, a glaring issue since the start of her career. Raducanu appears to have found a fruitful coaching partnership with the Spaniard Francisco Roig, previously a longtime member of Rafael Nadal’s coaching team, and she will start the 2026 season with a new combined physiotherapist and strength and conditioning coach in Emma Stewart, an experienced professional who has worked in tennis and was most recently part of British Rowing’s Olympic medal‑winning setup. In recent weeks, however, the goal has been to not think about tennis. After prematurely ending her season in Asia due to illness, Raducanu devoted significant time to improving her Chinese language skills during her time visiting family in her mother’s country of birth, her Spanish at the urging of Roig, and her French. “I was just like: ‘I’m trying to do everything,’” she says, smiling. “I really need rest days from my rest days. It’s actually quite consuming.” As the 2021 US Open champion describes her language learning odyssey, a member of her team interjects to note that he now receives texts from her in French, even though he does not speak the language. “It’s funny, because then I’ll just start mixing languages,” Raducanu says. “I’m saying a sentence with three different languages, and I just don’t even know what I’m saying. But I think it’s been great for me to put my mind to something else and to be occupied and feed my brain. It’s the best thing I can do for myself. And I feel like I’m just in a pretty content place, just trying to become a better version off the court.” Alongside some positive results, there have been ample difficult moments in 2025. Most notably, Raducanu’s encounters with a fixated individual in February drew global headlines. Those incidents naturally hurt her confidence, with the Briton previously stating that her neck would hurt from looking down in public to avoid people recognising her. “Now I don’t. My neck doesn’t hurt as much. I’m not looking down as much. Better posture,” she says, laughing. “But I’m like: ‘OK, what? Are they going to see me on the tube?’ It’s not a bad thing.” The comfort with which Raducanu navigated the city during the off-season has also shown her that she has put the incident behind her. “Honestly, I have gotten over it,” she says. “What did creep me out was I saw a photo of myself in London, and I didn’t see the paps [paparazzi]. I was with my two best friends. This happened last week, and it was some tabloid article saying I had a new boyfriend or whatever. But it’s literally my best friend’s brother. I was like: ‘Come on, guys. Come on. Be better. This is not [true].’ I was with my best friend’s brother, and we were going to the rugby. And of course, they cropped my best friend out. It was just me and this guy, and I just didn’t see the paps. So that’s obviously creepy. You know, when you’re like: ‘I didn’t see them. How did they take this photo?’ But other than that, I feel good because someone’s always watching my back.” Off the court, 2025 has been a contentious and controversial year in tennis. The most recent discourse has focused on the length of the season, with various players being critical of the demanding season. Raducanu, however, offers a different perspective to the likes of Iga Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and her fellow British No 1, Jack Draper. “I think that’s a challenge,” she says. “I don’t necessarily think it’s something to complain about because it’s what we are given. And we are making a great living as well. I mean it’s not all glamorous. There are definitely times when it’s very difficult and we are flagging mentally, physically, everything hurts. But at the same time what are we going to do about it? I am sure there are certain people who go to work and their bosses make them do something, but they have to do it, it’s their job. If we put up a front that isn’t complaining, I think that is a better example to the people watching, trying to get into tennis, the younger people. If they see all the top players moaning about the calendar, I don’t think that’s necessarily inspiring to look up to.” The next time Raducanu competes, she will be playing alongside her old friend Draper in the United Cup, the mixed-gender international team event that kicks off the season in Australia. Before then, an intense pre‑season block begins this week with Roig in Barcelona with the goal to build on the solid foundations established in 2025, to improve the quality of her shotmaking and begin to close the considerable gap between herself and the very best players in the world. “I think I went through some very difficult times on and off the court at the start of the year,” she says. “But I think it really taught me, like the strength that I have to pull myself out of it. Also what I need to do to avoid falling back in again. A lot of it is spending time studying, spending time learning, spending time nurturing my brain and just constantly that’s something I need. Learning about myself has been a great thing. So I feel very content.”"
sport_2025_dec_03_australia-conundrum-pat-cummins-ashes-second-test-preview.txt,sport,2025-12-03,Geoff Lemon in Brisbane,Cummins conundrum is key as Australia try not to overthink tactics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/australia-conundrum-pat-cummins-ashes-second-test-preview,"At last, at long last, an Ashes series is about to start. It feels that way, anyway, after so many months of lead-up, such an eternal blur of preview and prediction and preamble, were supposed to reach their end – only to find that the end was instead a momentary interruption, a hiccup, an indigestion-dream of a Test from Perth, a contest done in the span of 31 hours, leaving everyone to return to punditry and prognostication for a further 11 blasted and benighted days. We are, for pity’s sake, in a discussion cycle about Ben Stokes correctly applying a bike helmet while not on a bike, or Steve Smith correctly applying eye-black stickers in his Tim Tebow tribute act, or the archaeologically uncovered fact that Australian teams have a good record at the Gabba. Like farmers waiting for the rains, we are praying for play to start to let us talk about something that has happened, rather than something that might. Even the day-night format means another wait, four more hours than would usually be the case before the balm of the first ball. England confirmed their team well in advance with an interesting call, deciding that the best way to improve a side whose reckless batting imploded is by including a top-order T20 smasher at No 8 because he might bowl a few overs of spin that they do not think they need. But just at the moment when anyone observing this series felt that there was literally nothing left to talk about, Australia will now wait until the toss to decide on a gamble in their XI that they may be willing to take. The call is whether to include the regular captain Pat Cummins as part of a dizzying game of three-card monte that selectors have been playing with the squad in recent days. Usman Khawaja was included in that squad despite recent injury, then ruled out because of the same injury. Cummins was ruled out because of recent injury, and may come into the XI despite not being in the squad. The possible knock-on effects of both are convoluted. Cummins, it seems, is now feeling good enough in training that waiting for the third Test in Adelaide seems excessive. But overnight nerves might get the better of anyone in the decision-making chain, pondering the fallout that would await them if that comeback turned out to be too soon. That leaves a nation of Australians in the highly unusual position of going to sleep the night before a Test match without knowing who will captain the team the next day. The stand-in, Steve Smith, took the press conference as though he would do the job, but declined to confirm that this would be the case. If Cummins returns, the cards in the dealer’s hands could be whisked in various ways around the table. Perhaps in order to mitigate the number of overs required of him, he could be part of a four-man pace attack and replace Nathan Lyon. That might also mean bringing Beau Webster into the middle order, given he could offer spin. If Cummins plays alongside Lyon, instead replacing Brendan Doggett as one of three quicks, Webster could still be included to bowl backup seam alongside Cameron Green. If Webster does not bat in the middle, Josh Inglis will, because Travis Head will open the batting. Unless, that is, they decide to send Inglis up to open in the first innings, but perhaps send Head up to do the job second time around if they need to chase as they did in Perth, or to add fast third-innings runs before bowling in an evening session. Lyon, meanwhile, has no cause to be dropped simply because he is a spinner and the ball is pink. Much has been made of him being left out in Jamaica earlier this year, and two pink-ball Tests in Adelaide 2024 and Hobart 2022, where he was not required. This reasoning absurdly omits the other 11 day-night tests that he has played, all of which have seen him bowl more than 20 overs in the match, five of which have topped 40 overs, and the highest of which was 67 overs. Don’t get carried away, is the subtext. Pink-ball games can move in fast forward. So can red-ball games, as we saw at the start of this series 1 million years ago. Plenty of the time, though, pink-ball cricket can be long and slow and require graft, just like the other stuff. There will be tactical considerations about batting time in an effort to bowl in the evenings, but the evenings can be got through or turned to the batting team’s advantage, like any other session. Even in this series, even in this format, even if surprise inclusions do come to pass, there is still a chance that over five days, some of the cricket might feel normal. If it is another fast one, at least we will have 11 days to chat until Adelaide."
sport_2025_dec_03_australia-second-ashes-test-brisbane-gabba-cricket-team-starting-xi.txt,sport,2025-12-03,Ali Martin in Brisbane,Pat Cummins poised to return for Australia in second Ashes Test at Gabba,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/australia-second-ashes-test-brisbane-gabba-cricket-team-starting-xi,"The challenge for England could be set to increase amid a growing belief that Pat Cummins will be given the green light to return for Australia this week in the second Ashes Test at the Gabba. Cummins, 32, was absent from the series opener in Perth as he underwent the final stages of rehabilitation from a lower back stress injury that was first detected back in July. Steve Smith stepped up to captain as the hosts secured a 1-0 lead with an eight-wicket victory inside two days. But despite being left out of Australia’s initial squad for the day-night second Test in Brisbane, Cummins still travelled with the team and appears to have ticked every box in training since. Australia, however, have since said they will not name an XI until the toss at 1.30pm local time on Thursday. The question now is whether a hug between Cummins and head coach Andrew McDonald during a leadership meeting after training was confirmation of a return or simply done to throw on-looking reporters. Smith and chief selector George Bailey were also part of this pitch-side chat, before a fire alarm saw the ground briefly evacuated. Speaking earlier in the day, Smith said: “He’s looked pretty good to me, the way he’s bowled in the nets. Obviously games are different intensity but he’s tracking really nicely, he knows his body well. We’ll wait and see but like I said he’s close.” If Cummins is cleared to play then Australia will likely face a choice between dropping spinner Nathan Lyon and playing an all-seam attack – as occurred during their most recent pink ball Test in Jamaica back in July – or asking Brendan Doggett to step aside after a five-wicket debut in Perth. Smith added: “We’ll look at the surface and sum things up from there. [The Gabba] is a place where Nathan has done really well in the past, he’s a quality bowler. We’ll weigh up the options and see how we go.” Asked about the possibility of Cummins returning, England captain Ben Stokes replied: “Pat is awesome. Has been for a very, very, very long time. Whatever XI they go with, we’ll still be going in there to try and get the win this week.” At least one change to Australia’s XI is guaranteed, with Usman Khawaja having already been ruled out of the match after failing to overcome a back injury. Josh Inglis, who usually bats in the middle order, is seen as the favourite to come in, meaning Travis Head may continue up top. England know all about Inglis and not just from his early years in the Yorkshire academy. Having been born in Leeds, but moved to Perth with his family at 15, the right-hander struck an unbeaten 120 from 86 balls in Lahore back in February to terminate their Champions Trophy hopes. Inglis also put on a show against the England Lions a fortnight ago, crashing 125 not out at Lilac Hill to guide a Cricket Australia XI to an eight-wicket win in a four-day tour match. In form, and having scored a century on his Test debut in Sri Lanka this year, he is a dangerous customer. Smith added: “[Inglis] is obviously a pretty attacking batsman and did really well on his debut in Sri Lanka. He plays fast bowling really nicely. So if he gets his opportunity I’m sure he’ll do really well for us”."
sport_2025_dec_03_challenges-lie-ahead-in-day-night-test-but-england-have-what-it-takes-to-shock-australia.txt,sport,2025-12-03,Mark Ramprakash,Challenges lie ahead in day-night Test but England have what it takes to shock Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/challenges-lie-ahead-in-day-night-test-but-england-have-what-it-takes-to-shock-australia,"There has been a lot of discussion over the past week about day-night Tests, how to approach them and whether they produce quality cricket. Stuart Broad described them as a lottery but Australia’s outstanding record would suggest that actually the best team normally prevails, and skill should win the day. The question for England is whether they have it in them to dominate in relatively unfamiliar conditions, to win key battles at key moments and to take control. I remember the day-night Test in Adelaide in 2017, when I was with the England team as batting coach. I personally enjoyed the spectacle and felt it was a good challenge for the players. We lost that match despite going into it having played four first-class games and the first Test in Brisbane, so we had a volume of cricket under our belt. A pink-ball Test was something new, but the players all felt they were up to speed in terms of match cricket. This England side are nowhere near, and that is a concern. You need what I call your match-head on, and that only comes from playing matches. I’m firmly of the view that you can have all the nets sessions you want, but it’s not the same – when you play a loose drive in the nets there is no consequence, a lack of precision goes unpunished. In a match you have to walk off. Having said that, I still absolutely believe they are capable of coming back and shocking Australia. That confidence is based on the first half of the Perth match, and in the amount of continuity and experience that runs through the side. But for all that experience, this week will bring new challenges. Steve Smith has been experimenting with “eye blacks” in training, trying to reduce the glare of the floodlights. His record in pink-ball Tests is massively worse than in standard games: in red-ball matches in Australia he averages 65.72 with a century every 4.7 innings, but in day-night games at home his average is 38.10, with one century in 22 innings, and he clearly still feels uncomfortable and is working on ways to counter that. I suppose it’s a good thing for England to know that Australia’s best and most prolific batter has not been able to dominate these matches – he says it’s “just a completely different game” and that he finds it “tricky just picking the ball up at certain times of the day” – but it also demonstrates how much of a challenge they are facing. Hopefully the players will find that exciting. There are different phases in day-night games, and those who can recognise and play well when conditions change, those who adapt, are the ones who will succeed. They will understand that twilight can be particularly tricky – batting in the heat of the day is a distinct phase, and so is batting under the lights at night. The real trouble is between those two phases, when the light and conditions are constantly shifting. The temperature drops and that can help the ball to zip through, and a pitch that has looked placid suddenly has that bit more pace. We definitely saw that in Adelaide. Then there is the pink ball itself. As the bowler is running in, generally a batter will get some sort of sighting of the ball in his hand, be able to decipher which side is the shiny side, and get some sort of clue about what the bowler is trying to do and the kind of delivery he is looking to bowl. Alastair Cook has described how much harder it is to glean that information from the pink ball. England’s battle is not just against the Australia team, with Mitchell Starc historically so successful in these matches, but against the combination of unfamiliar light and an unfamiliar ball. What we learned from their collapse in the second innings in Perth was that England’s batters still struggle to identify the moments in an innings where they should change approach and absorb pressure for a while. I hope they are able to change. Ben Stokes spoke to the media this week and made it very clear that he has reflected in depth on how the first Test went and his part in it, his captaincy and his performance. I found his words hugely encouraging – people feel this group of Bazballers are not in the reflection game, but clearly that is not the case and they should all have done their share. Stokes also said he likes to keep things simple. Whenever elite sportspeople say that I find it hard to swallow. When a player has a wealth of experience, as Stokes does, things can seem straightforward, simply because they have so much information and can funnel down to what is important in any given moment. But there is nothing simple about some of the situations his team will face this week. They have already got one big decision right. Bringing in Will Jacks, someone who can bowl a bit of spin, play an aggressive form of batting at No 8 and can field well, is the right call. It gives them another option, a change of pace – and perhaps when Travis Head was carving the fast bowlers around Perth Stadium they could have benefited from slowing things down and making him think a bit. I like the look of Josh Tongue but another pace bowler might not actually have bowled that much or contributed in the field or with the bat. I just hope that England’s batters have recognised that driving at balls on the up is a massive no-no in Australian conditions. When the ball is full and straight, absolutely hit it back where it’s come from. But there is a line around fourth or fifth stump, whether it’s on the front or back foot, where if you are playing with a slightly angled bat you’re asking for trouble. You have to be prepared to leave more balls in that channel and wait for the straight one, or one that’s a bit wider and you can look to cut or pull. That is the method that brought Michael Vaughan such success in 2002-03 and I hope in particular that Joe Root grasps this opportunity to get in and bat some time. The first Test ended in just two days and the second is being played in conditions that can mean games change very quickly. Perhaps this will be an occasion for a team that always seems in a hurry to occasionally press pause. Thanks to that early finish in Perth they have certainly had plenty of time to prepare and England should be aware of this game’s unique challenges, so they won’t be caught out, they won’t be shocked; they’ll be prepared and ready to adapt. As, of course, all elite teams should be."

Anyone have the square marked “owner and star player accused of skirting the salary cap through improper means”? Go ahead and stamp that one. How about “losing 14 of 16 after a hopeful 3-2 start”? Mark it. And yes, you can fill in “other star averaging nearly 27 a night at age 36 – including a 50-piece against the Detroit Pistons, one of the league’s best teams”. The box reading “Clippers fans tearing out their hair at alarming rates and contemplating shameful, fairweather defections” is probably safe to cross off, pending review. And after the wee-hours media cycle on Wednesday morning, everyone gets to tick the most dispiriting square of all: “beloved, decorated veteran unceremoniously kicked to the curb in his final season”. The Clippers had posted a winning record every year since 2010-11, building a reputation as one of the NBA’s most reliable playoff fixtures. Twenty-one games into this young season, that identity has dissolved into something hazy around the edges – and unmistakably sinister. The decorated vet in question is 40-year-old Chris Paul, who posted via an Instagram story that the Clippers were sending him home from their ongoing road trip. Lawrence Frank, the Clippers’ president of basketball operations, confirmed the news in a statement to ESPN: “We are parting ways with Chris, and he will no longer be a part of the team.” Frank added of Paul, amidst bland platitudes of his status as a Clippers icon, “I want to make one thing very clear. No one is blaming Chris for our underperformance.” Clearly. Paul joined the Clippers in 2011 and helped launch their long run of winning seasons before departing in 2017. (His eventual trade to Houston brought back seven players, a protected 2018 first-round pick and the better part of a million dollars.) In LA he averaged 18.8 points and 9.8 assists, made three All-NBA first teams and turned the franchise into Lob City with those feathered lobs to Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan – finally giving a long-moribund club both identity and excitement. He stole the ball so relentlessly he mangled his own fingers, his gnarled digits earning a feature in the New York Times. People called him the “Point God”. He’ll be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, all while standing just six feet tall. He never won a championship, making only the one NBA Finals appearance with the Phoenix Suns in 2021, but his Clippers years earned him enormous acclaim. Which is why returning in 2025 clearly meant so much – Paul accepted a reserve role for one last season, and the fans embraced the homecoming just as deeply. The honeymoon didn’t last very long. Time dulls even the sharpest skills, however intact the instincts remain. Paul averaged just over 14 minutes and three points a game in his return. And, according to ESPN’s style-challenged scoop machine Shams Charania, he had been “vocal in holding management, coaches and players accountable, which the team felt became disruptive”, even going weeks without speaking to Tyronn Lue. Was Paul truly so irritating that exile was the only option, or is management flailing for answers amid a grisly run of results? For anyone who thought injury was the only potential snag in this feelgood reunion, consider this a reminder: losing opens every old wound. What began as a heartwarming final-season subplot has now ended abruptly and awkwardly. It only makes the Clippers – tied with the tragic Sacramento Kings for second-last in the West (thank god for the Pelicans, somehow worse than both) – look even more dysfunctional. Tell a new NBA fan, or an alien, that this team went life and death with Nikola Jokić’s imperious Denver Nuggets in last season’s playoffs and they’d stare back in confusion. Only the 4-17 Indiana Pacers, a game away from the NBA Finals trophy six months ago, have fallen harder. At least they can blame a brutal run of injuries. As for Paul? His career will remain broadly respected and fondly remembered, this unfortunate final chapter aside. The one lingering regret is the obvious one: the missing championship. Sentiment surely played a role in his decision to return, but so did the chance – however slim – to chase that elusive Larry O’Brien trophy with a team that looked strong last spring. He won’t be winning with the Clippers now. And unless their early-season collapse is some grand basketball mirage, they won’t be winning without him either."

Lloyd is eight years old and living with a rare genetic condition that renders him non-mobile, non-verbal, with a severe intellectual disability and reliant on a feeding tube for sustenance. Around 30% of children with such a condition don’t live past the age of five. Lloyd’s mother Maya Pinn, who designed his skate gear and is also the founder of RareWear Australia, which designs adaptive clothing for children with a disability, says Lloyd has taken to skateboarding as he is a real thrill-seeker who loves hard rock music. She recently took him to see AC/DC at a concert in Melbourne – Hells Bells is his favourite song of all time. “He lives for risky play – including pretend wrestling with his friends, and now he is learning to love skating,” Pinn says. When she saw the email from the Victorian group Advocating for Children with Disability offering supported skating for children with disabilities, she jumped at the opportunity, not realising they had advertised for kids over 12. “I called straight away and when I explained Lloyd’s disabilities and that he’s a real daredevil boy who loves risk and fun they were open to Lloyd taking part.” Pinn says that as a mum she thinks a lot about fairness, but when people use terms like “accessible” or “inclusive” she often just sighs because so many activities still don’t include kids such as Lloyd who have complex needs. “Lloyd wants to have fun just like any other kid. But for him, fun needs to look a little different. And that’s OK ... when people are willing to try.” The Disability Sport &amp; Recreation festival in Melbourne on Friday, now in its 15th year, is designed to offer people of all abilities the chance to explore and experience a range of accessible and inclusive sport and recreation activities – including a wheelchair rugby match and music from DJ Cooper, a successful DJ and producer with cerebral palsy. Among those attending this year will be Nigeria-born Peter Ogunyemi, who credits sport with saving his life. After being born with polio and crawling to school, he has become a wheelchair basketballer and AFL player. According to Matthew Brett, Skate Action Sports manager for the YMCA, the all-ability skate frame came to his attention when it was presented at a Moomba event by Albury-based skateboard designer and coach Al Taylor. The structure allows skaters to safely stand and move on a skateboard with the assistance of trained instructors. “I immediately knew that this was something big with the potential to provide a whole new type of experience for people who can’t skateboard independently. Delivering the all abilities session at Riverslide Skate Park with Maya and Lloyd has honestly been one of the most heartwarming experiences of my career,” he says. Brett says skateboarding should be an activity for everyone and that if you have the guts to give it a shot you will find the culture incredibly welcoming. “Having a tool to help people who can’t physically skateboard by themselves get out on to the skate park is an incredible step forward.“ Dave Wells, CEO of festival sponsor Reclink Australia, says the festival aligns closely with Reclink’s aims of helping people with disability find and access local, welcoming sport and active recreation opportunities. “Ultimately, inclusivity is about removing barriers, not lowering expectations,” says Wells. “It’s making sure people with disabilities can enjoy the same opportunities to move, play and belong as anyone else. “We see sport and recreation participation as an essential service for our community to connect people to community and to other opportunities.” Maya says the skate frame has given Lloyd his very first taste of skateboarding – and he is hooked – but he couldn’t have done it without support. “With the right people, the right attitude and a bit of creative thinking, he got to do something we weren’t even sure was possible. “When we make space for kids like Lloyd to belong, we don’t just include them, we elevate everyone. Skateboarding becomes not just a sport, but a bridge between worlds. Thank you for this magical moment. Let’s keep creating spaces where every child gets to do ‘kid things’, especially the ones who’ve been told they can’t. This is what real inclusion looks like.” And how does Lloyd feel about skating? “Pure joy,” she says."
sport_2025_dec_03_england-australia-pink-ball-wizard-mitchell-starc-cricket-the-spin.txt,sport,2025-12-03,James Wallace,Pink-ball wizard: batters on facing ‘devastating weapon’ Mitchell Starc,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/england-australia-pink-ball-wizard-mitchell-starc-cricket-the-spin,"That tall, fast and slim kid, sure bowls a mean pink ball. Leading into Thursday’s crucial second Test match, a day-night affair at Brisbane’s Gabba, much has been made of Mitchell Starc’s pink-ball wizardry. With 81 wickets at an average of 17.08, the lissom-limbed southpaw seamer has more wickets than any other with the pink’un in hand. Just what English supporters want to read as their side pitches up at a ground where they haven’t won a Test match in 39 years. Starc is riding particularly high at the moment. He needs just three more Test wickets to go past Wasim Akram’s 414, when he surely does this series (ahem, this match) he will be top of the tree as the left-arm seamer with the most Test scalps. In the first Test at Perth Starc picked up the first Ashes 10-wicket haul for an Australian bowler since Shane Warne in 2005, he pocketed Zak Crawley for a pair and bagged Ben Stokes twice. Worryingly for England, Starc has Stokes’s number in Test cricket – 11 dismissals in total with five of them and counting in Australia where there’s a possible eight remaining chances to make it Stokesmite on toast. Smashed Stokeso on rye with feta. What makes Starc so dangerous with the pink ball? Well, a lot of the same things that make him so dangerous with the red and white balls too. He slings it down at speeds touching 90mph, bowls a full length zoning in on stumps, pads and toes and has a rapid bouncer that can fly past the nose. Eight years ago today the former England opener Mark Stoneman was batting against Starc under lights with the pink ball in Adelaide during the second Ashes Test of the 2017-18 Ashes. It’s fair to say the experience is still sharp in his memory. “The lights beaming down, the pink ball shining, the crowd roaring and Starc hooping it about at searing pace. Good luck basically. He is a devastating weapon in those conditions.” Stoneman was pinned lbw in the first innings at Adelaide for 18, a scudding yorker from Starc ending a half-hour examination under lights. “It’s that twilight period that is trickiest,” says Stoneman. “If it is pure daylight or pure floodlight then that is fine, you tend to be able to pick up the ball without any issues, even if it is coming down really fast, but when it is that inbetween light, that’s when it gets really hard.” Some batters struggle with the glare of the pink ball under lights. Steve Smith, so often England’s Ashes tormentor in chief over the past decade isn’t really a fan. Smith’s nosebleed inducing statistics take something of a nosedive against the pink ball – one hundred in 24 innings at an average of 37.04 compared with his record in regular daytime Test matches of 35 hundreds in 190 innings at an average of 58.31. Smith has been spotted this week in practice under the Gabba floodlights using the under eye anti-glare strips favoured by the West Indian batter Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the past. It’s this glare that former England captain Alastair Cook lamented in his column for the Sunday Times this week. “When the floodlights shine off the pink leather, it distracts from focusing on the black seam – and if you can’t see the seam as a batsman, you’re in big trouble.” Starc has of late added a wobble seam delivery to his armoury, a ball that jags in at the left-handed batter like a cross cobra, it’s the one that did for Ben Stokes so emphatically in England’s first innings at Perth. All told, it’s hard to stop an English mind wandering helplessly to imagined scenes in the Gabba gloaming a few hours from now, England’s batters collectively squinting like Mr Magoo as Starc conjures up glimmering pink, indecipherable hexes. The former South Africa captain Dean Elgar found himself in something of a similar position in a day-night Test at Adelaide in 2016, as Starc sent Elgar on his way for scores of five and nought as Australia beat South Africa by seven wickets. “Starcy is a serious threat to an opening batter no matter what the colour of the ball,” Elgar says. “In Australia the crowd really respond to seeing him doing his thing and they pump up his tyres, he really rises to the occasion. “But that black seam on the pink ball is tricky to see against the black sightscreens, put that with the fact that that Adelaide pitch was greener than my lawn … he’s a phenomenal threat in any conditions but even more so in those.” One man who had some success against the pink-hued Starc under lights was Dawid Malan. In the 2021-22 Ashes the left-handed batter scored 80 in the first innings of the day-night match at Adelaide. England went on to lose by 275 runs but you can’t have it all. “I’m actually smiling at the memory,” says Malan of his duel against Starc. “It was so intense and just thrilling to be out there facing this guy. He never said a word but would occasionally smirk at you if he beat you, sometimes that was worse than a sledge, the sheer disdain!” Even if Starc got him in the end, Malan found a way to score runs against him. “You know Starc is going to come at you, he is after your stumps and pads, he’s the ultimate pole hunter. I was always looking for width to pull or cut away and set up to hit him through midwicket if he gets it slightly wrong and drifts on to the pads, which he can do. “I wish I could do it all over again.” England may yet emerge from Brisbane with a smile and some visceral memories of their own to savour. The alternative? They’re left dazzled by the pink-ball wizard once again. This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

sport_2025_dec_03_favourable-world-cup-rugby-world-cup-draw-england.txt,sport,2025-12-03,Robert Kitson,Favourable 2027 Rugby World Cup draw provides few potholes for England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/favourable-world-cup-rugby-world-cup-draw-england,"As the Ashes have reminded us, it never pays to get too excited in advance about winning in Australia. But once the draw for the 2027 men’s Rugby World Cup had concluded and the various knockout permutations had been crunched there was a strong whiff of deja vu in the Sydney air. A World Cup in Australia and a decent draw for England? What could possibly go wrong? The organisers had already stoked the narrative nicely by wheeling out Jonny Wilkinson in the promotional tournament video, essentially a mashup of Mad Max and Wacky Races roaring across a dusty outback. When every Australian wakes up on Thursday to discover it is 666 days until the 2027 edition kicks off, the nagging fear of nightmarish history repeating itself will further intensify. The cards have certainly fallen more kindly for England than for several of their rivals. While they are lurking in one of the shallower of the six pools – Wales, Tonga and Zimbabwe – the opening game of the tournament, in Perth on 1 October, may well thrust together the Wallabies and the All Blacks from minute one. The reward for the winners? A possible place in the same side of the knockout draw as the defending champions, South Africa, and France. It could well mean that once again only one of the Springboks, the All Blacks and Les Bleus will be able to feature in the final, assuming all of them top their pools. Even the pack leaders, South Africa will not be entirely relaxed about having to beat New Zealand and France on successive weekends simply to reach the final in Sydney on 13 November. There will be little in the way of gentle foreplay either for Ireland and Scotland, who collided in the pool stages in France in 2023. Should they finish second, Scotland can expect to bump into France in the last 16 – with 24 countries now involved, the format has had a makeover – while Ireland could easily end up meeting their old nemesis Argentina in the last eight. That is not to say England’s route to the final is devoid of potholes, but their opponents will mostly be familiar ones. Hopefully, Welsh rugby will have rebounded from its lowly position by then, but even the proprietor of Cardiff’s biggest inflatable leek shop would not put much money on a repeat of Wales’s pool win against England at Twickenham in 2015. Tonga and Zimbabwe, ranked 18th and 24th in the world respectively, are also less threatening than, say, Georgia and a revitalised Samoa might have been. A potential last-16 clash with Italy, who have never beaten England, is the perfect sort of mind‑concentrating knockout game the Red Rose management would like at that stage of the tournament. And then? If Australia cannot beat New Zealand it opens up the very real spectre of them being dumped out of their own tournament – again – by England. Then again, if anything is going to galvanise this Australia side, that surely will. Two years is also a long time and it could yet be that another National Rugby League recruit or two will materialise to bolster the host nation’s prospects. Whoever emerges, however, would not mind a semi-final against an ageing Ireland or Argentina, particularly if the Boks have already been sensationally ejected from the running. While Argentina continue to improve and Ireland will never be less than awkward, it definitely feels more possible than it did at the start of the week that England could go all the way. A bold conclusion, maybe. But if they can build on their run of 11 Test victories, they should certainly arrive with more squad depth than at any stage since 2003. With several fast-maturing youngsters and a talismanic captain, there is obvious scope for further improvement over the next couple of seasons. The Rugby Football Union could even do worse than recruit Sir Clive Woodward as a part-time strategic consultant, if only to wind up the Australians even more than Henry Pollock is poised to do. Woodward’s side, crucially, was accustomed to winning and the old TCUP mindset – Thinking Correctly Under Pressure – made a massive difference when they were under the pump against Wales in the quarter-finals and locked in an extra-time arm wrestle in the final. “Watching this was the worst experience of my life,” the Wallaby lock Justin Harrison said, wearily, as footage of Wilkinson’s 2003 coup de grace was replayed yet again after the draw. So all aboard for the 2027 sequel: “Beware The Great White – They’re Back!” The blessed Jonny will not be available to put the boot in again this time, but his compatriots have a fresh glint in their eyes. When the first batch of tickets go on sale in February, expect plenty of applications from English postcodes."

Cricket bosses and players still not seeing benefit of day-night Tests,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/in-the-pink-cricket-bosses-and-players-still-not-seeing-benefit-of-day-night-tests,"In October 2012, the International Cricket Council formally green-lit the idea of day-night Tests, offering a new, potentially lucrative spin on the oldest format. “This is all about new audiences and doing all we could to make the game more accessible at every level,” said the England and Wales Cricket Board’s then chief executive, Tom Harrison, when he announced his side’s first pink-ball game a few years later. James Sutherland, Cricket Australia’s chief executive, welcomed the change from a status quo in which “Test cricket is played at times when most people are at work or school. We limit ourselves by staging cricket’s premium format at times when fans often can not watch.” Since that decision 24 of 554 Tests have been day-night games. Outside Australia, their most enthusiastic adopters, there have been 11, out of a possible 486. Instead of turning on a new demographic to the joys of Test cricket, the idea has been a turn-off: England have only staged one, in 2017; South Africa’s only attempt came a few months later; West Indies, Pakistan and New Zealand have held two each and India three. This week’s second Test at the Gabba will be Australia’s 14th. For Cricket Australia the benefit of these matches can be measured in two metrics: TV viewing figures and cash. It gives them a second Test – after the one in Perth, where the time difference is helpful – with play during peak viewing hours on the east coast, home to about 80% of the population. From the first day of the first pink-ball Test, against New Zealand in 2015, viewers have tuned in in large numbers: that game was watched by an average of 1.46m in the five major cities, 27% up on that year’s Perth Test. Their day-night game against South Africa in 2016 again saw a 27% bump. In 2017, 42% of the country’s metropolitan population watched at least some of the first Ashes day-nighter and so on to last year’s match against India, when every session but one brought in more than a million viewers. More viewers means more money: CA’s A$45m-a-year broadcast deal became A$100m in 2013, A$197m in 2018 and A$216m in 2023. Fans also enjoy an improved, or at least a different, experience with Adelaide – which has hosted eight of their day-nighters – getting it down to a fine art. “What they’ve done with the pink ball Test is pretty awesome, how they’ve made it an event, how it all kind of fits together,” says Marnus Labuschagne. The numbers have not added up everywhere and when the West Indies hosted, inevitably, Australia in a day-night game in July it was the third outside Australia this decade. They were bowled out for 27 in their second innings and are unlikely to be wildly keen on a repeat. Indeed, every country but one, and for a variety of reasons, has more or less dropped the idea. India held three, but they all ended inside three days (the one involving England didn’t make it past day two) so any commercial benefit from the timing was outweighed by the losses caused by the early finishes. “Spectators lose money, broadcasters lose money,” said Jay Shah, former secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India and now chair of the ICC. This was not the idea. Pakistan were initially keen, inviting Sri Lanka to take part in what would have been the first day-night Test in 2013 (they said no). Eventually, a couple of touring teams agreed to games, West Indies in 2016 and a now-willing Sri Lanka the following year, both held in Dubai. “In principle, the PCB is supportive of and inclined towards accepting and trying out innovative ideas and new technologies,” said the Pakistan Cricket Board’s chief executive, Subhan Ahmed. Sadly, their Emirates-based fanbase was not so supportive of innovative ideas and a combination of miserable attendances and heavy dewfall curtailed the experiment. New Zealand hosted their first day-night game in 2018, but two days were rained off, attendances were disappointing, and it took them five years to have a second, and to date final, go. There is a small, but important difference here between most associations and many players: most associations can’t see the benefit of pink-ball games, many players can’t see the pink ball. Before they were first used, manufacturers tested a variety of colours, including yellow and orange. The PCB held a T20 tournament in 2016 with an orange ball, but it did not go down well – unless you were trying to catch it, in which case it went down very easily indeed. “It was a horrible experience for the fielders,” said Misbah-ul-Haq. “Some catches even fell on their heads, they just couldn’t see it.” Yellow balls appeared blurry on television, so that was them out. Kookaburra tested 16 different shades of pink and three colours of stitching before settling on their favourite combination though after player feedback the seam was quickly changed from white and green to black. “It’s easier than the white seam,” Joe Root said this week. “That was a nightmare.” But there is an inherent problem with a pink ball: around sunset the higher-frequency wavelengths of light become scattered and for a short time red light becomes dominant. This is why the sun, having appeared yellow all day, often looks orange or red as it sets. A number of academic studies have identified a change in the pink ball’s contrast polarity – the relationship between an object and its background – during this period. With all the red light around it becomes harder to see. The pink Kookaburra also swings more than their red version while new, so put a fresh one in the hands of a skilled seamer at the right time of day and havoc can ensue – particularly at the Gabba, where Brisbane’s humidity already helps swing bowlers. Worried about the risk of injury, players were so reluctant to take part in that first day-night Test in 2015 that Cricket Australia had to increase the prize money for the series by A$1m before they signed up. If those fears have eased over the past decade England were still being warned about “wickets falling in clumps” at twilight. Players could improve the situation by wearing glasses with coloured lenses during the most troublesome period, but this has not caught on. Once the sun sets completely, and floodlights take over, that troublesome contrast polarity resets. But this week Travis Head, who has played 15% of his Test innings in day-night games and scored 30% of his centuries in them, played down the impact of the blush ball. “If you win you think it’s great and if you lose maybe not.” (Australia have won 14 of their 15 day-nighters and Head nine of his 10.) “I think it’s great. It still works the same way, still five days, it’s just with a slightly different colour ball. Pink ball, white ball, red ball, who really cares?”"
sport_2025_dec_03_maro-itoje-eyes-rugby-world-cup-glory-after-england-dodge-big-guns-in-2027-draw.txt,sport,2025-12-03,Luke McLaughlin,Maro Itoje eyes World Cup glory after England dodge big guns in 2027 draw,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/maro-itoje-eyes-rugby-world-cup-glory-after-england-dodge-big-guns-in-2027-draw,"Maro Itoje has set his sights on Rugby World Cup glory in Australia in 2027 after England were handed a potentially favourable path through the tournament when the draw was made in Sydney on Wednesday. England, who have risen to third in the world rankings after an 11-match winning streak, emerged on the other side of the draw from the reigning world champions, South Africa, the three-times winners New Zealand and France. England are in Pool F with Wales, Tonga and Zimbabwe at the expanded 24-team event with Italy, Australia, Ireland and Argentina possible opponents in the last 16 and beyond. “Our ambition is to do very well and win this tournament,” Itoje, the England captain, said. “But to do that we know we have to make sure we get our preparation right and the next two years leading to the World Cup is massive. We need to build throughout time and make sure we’re tracking in the right direction.” England’s head coach, Steve Borthwick, said excitement around the draw was “wonderful” and echoed Itoje on the objective for 2027, 24 years after England dramatically defeated the Wallabies in Sydney to become world champions for the first and only time. “We’ve been very clear in saying our aim is to win the World Cup and a number of other nations will be saying the same,” Borthwick said. “We are working towards it. “The team is progressing, it’s transitioned a lot since the last World Cup over the last 18 months … I want to make sure that our supporters in Australia in two years’ time have loads to cheer about.” Asked for his memories of the Wales victory against the hosts England at the 2015 tournament, Borthwick said: “As ever with every England v Wales game, it was very hard-fought and I am sure the game in Australia will be exactly the same: full of passion and full of spirit.” Itoje said he will relish the expectation that seems bound to grow as a buoyant England build towards the tournament. “The converse would not be ideal, if this England team had no expectation or you played for a team that had no hopes,” he said. “That’s a situation I don’t want to be in. If we want to go out and do what we want to do, we have to walk that line and welcome whatever comes. If that’s part of it we have to welcome that.” A Wales repeat of 2015 seems a remote prospect – they have slipped to 11th in the world and were humbled in a record 73-0 home defeat by South Africa last Saturday – and pool-stage jeopardy is lessened with four third-placed teams qualifying. “It’s just exciting,” said Steve Tandy, the Wales head coach. “Going to the World Cup, seeing the draw, different format with smaller groups – we just can’t wait to get started. I know it’s two years away but the excitement builds straight away. “Those big games against England are always massive and being in the World Cup they seem bigger. But Tonga and Zimbabwe pose different challenges. Overall it is just unbelievably exciting and obviously most people will focus on the England game.” Scotland will again meet Ireland in the pool stage having been defeated by them at the 2019 tournament in Japan and again in France four years later. “It would help massively if we got on the right side of the result for a change,” said Gregor Townsend, the Scotland head coach. “We know how tough it will be and we’ll be doing everything we can to win that game.” Asked if he would have preferred to avoid Ireland, whom Scotland last defeated in 2017 with 11 consecutive losses coming since then, Townsend said: “When you see the teams in the top six they’re all quality sides. Some have done really well at World Cups, some have done really well in Six Nations. You know it’s going to be a very difficult game. It’s one we want to win and top our pool because things get easier if you go through first.”"
sport_2025_dec_03_nicola-pietrangeli-obituary.txt,sport,2025-12-03,Richard Evans,Nicola Pietrangeli obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/nicola-pietrangeli-obituary,"The Italian tennis player Nicola Pietrangeli, who has died aged 92, played more Davis Cup matches than anyone in the history of a competition that stretches back to 1900. In the days when the leading tennis nations played more Davis Cup ties each year than they do under the current system, Pietrangeli played 66 ties in 18 years, emerging with a proud record of having won 120 rubbers and lost only 44. Seventy-eight of those victories came in singles and he was assisted in his 42 doubles wins by his regular partner, Orlando Sirola. Even in the current era of exceptional Italian success in tennis, led by the reigning Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner, Pietrangeli will be remembered as one of his country’s most elegant and admired sportsmen. His game was based on court craft and one of the most beautiful and effective backhands the game has ever seen. Most of his success came on European clay courts, but he was good enough on grass to reach the Wimbledon semi-final in 1960 when, having beaten the No 2 seed, Barry MacKay of the US, in the quarter-final, he lost to Rod Laver 6-4 in the fifth set after leading by two sets to one. Three weeks before, Pietrangeli had established himself as the master of clay, having retained the French title he won the previous year with a five-set win over one of the best South Americans of that era, Luis Ayala of Chile. It was, however, the manner in which he lost his French crown in 1961 that lingers in the memory. Pietrangeli found himself facing a young Spaniard called Manuel Santana, whose father had been a groundskeeper at a club in Madrid. It turned out to be the perfect match-up – the classic Italian backhand vying for supremacy over Santana’s explosive forehand, augmented by the Spaniard’s feathery touch on the drop shot. The duel held the centre court crowd at Roland Garros in rapt attention, punctuated by bursts of wild applause as the audience reacted to the feast of great clay court tennis being laid before them. Pietrangeli led by two sets to one, but could not prevent the younger man seizing control of the match in the latter stages with a great show of aggression and when Santana wrapped it up 4-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-0, 6-2, the one-time ball boy fell on the shoulders of the vanquished champion in floods of tears. Suddenly Pietrangeli found himself consoling the player who had just divested him of his title. Pietrangeli, known as Nikki to his friends, was born in Tunis, the son of Anna (nee von Yourgens) and Giulio Pietrangeli. When his family moved to Rome, Pietrangeli started to play much of his tennis at one of the city’s leading clubs, the Circolo Canottieri. Quickly establishing himself as a top junior, Pietrangeli soon became an integral part of Italy’s Davis Cup team in the mid-1950s and, as players such as Fausto Gardini and Beppe Merlo began to wind down their careers, this languid, almost stately performer became Italy’s new sporting heartthrob. Pietrangeli’s partnership with the 6ft 6in Sirola meant that Italy were frequently able to claim the all-important doubles point, and the potency of this combination enabled Pietrangeli to lead his country to its first ever Davis Cup final in 1960. They repeated the feat a year later but, unfortunately for all nations whose natural surface was clay, the Davis Cup challenge round, as it was then called, was almost always played on grass, for the simple reason that the defending nation did not have to play through. So Australia, with Laver and Roy Emerson in their ranks, had a huge advantage at White City stadium, Sydney, in 1960 and at Kooyong in Melbourne 12 months later. The Italians failed to win a live rubber in either final. The challenge round system had allowed Australia and the US to pass the Cup between them ever since 1937. Incredibly, these two nations enjoyed a lock-out from that date until the challenge round was abolished in 1972 and, even then, the US clung on to the Cup for two more years until the stranglehold was broken when India refused to play South Africa in the 1974 final because of apartheid. But Pietrangeli was not finished with his favourite competition. Appointed Italy’s team captain in the mid-70s, he finally achieved his goal when he ushered Adriano Panatta, Corrado Barazzutti and Paolo Bertolucci through to the final in 1976. Once again, Italy found themselves having to play the final on the other side of the world, but this time it did not matter because their opponents were Chile, the surface was clay and they won 4-1. Panatta was the new hero but the reflected glory shone rightfully on Pietrangeli, too. Never a man to shy away from controversy, Pietrangeli was a central figure in the late 60s when the battle for control of the game was raging between the growing professional ranks and the old amateur establishment. Britain was leading the fight to throw tennis open to professionals – which eventually happened in 1968 – but, just prior to that, the reactionary Italian federation president, Giorgio de Stefani, himself a former Italian No 1, had threatened to have Britain thrown out of the international federation for fostering “illegal” plans to admit professionals to the mainstream game. Pietrangeli had been telling me things in private conversations, and when I phoned him up in 1967 to ask him to put the salient facts on record, he did, admitting that De Stefani, in the name of the Italian federation, had paid him to stay amateur. “Yes, they paid me money,” Pietrangeli admitted, thus exposing the level of hypocrisy and “shamateurism” that was rife in the amateur game at the time. Pietrangeli’s revelation only helped to hasten the collapse of the old order. Pietrangeli, multilingual, witty and charming, continued to be a major figure in European tennis, and was involved in the running of the Italian Open at various times. In 2006, one of the stadium courts at the Foro Italico sports complex in Rome, marble-tiered and surrounded by giant statues, was renamed the Stadio Nicola Pietrangeli in his honour. In 1960 he married Susanna Artero, a model, with whom he had three sons, and after their divorce in the mid-70s subsequently had a seven-year relationship with the TV presenter Licia Colò. He is survived by two sons, Marco and Filippo; the third, Giorgio, died earlier this year. • Nicola Pietrangeli, tennis player, born 11 September 1933; died 1 December 2025"

The change of name brings the men’s and women’s teams, who between them have won Hundred titles in each of the past five years, in line with the rest of the Ambani family’s Mumbai Indians holdings which, in addition to its Indian Premier League team, includes MI Cape Town in the SA20, MI Emirates in the ILT20 and MI New York in Major League Cricket. The Ambanis, through their Reliance company, bought 49% of Oval Invincibles in an auction which valued the franchise at £123m. Surrey will retain a 51% share in the franchise and marks the completion of the final deal from the England and Wales Cricket Board’s sale of equity stakes in the Hundred this year. Surrey said on Wednesday in a statement: “Surrey county cricket club and Reliance today announced their partnership in the Oval Invincibles franchise in the Hundred. As part of this new partnership, from 2026 both the men’s and the women’s teams will be known as MI London.” Oli Slipper, the Surrey chairman said: “We’re pleased to have reached an agreement with the Reliance team over our partnership in the Hundred franchise team. Reliance bring a significant depth of cricket and business expertise and have had great success with their franchise teams in India and around the world. “We have worked very closely with Reliance over the name of the new team and believe that MI London will give us the best opportunity to build the fanbase at home and across the world.”"

The Wallabies, hosting a second men’s tournament, were guaranteed to face a top-ranked nation in Pool A due to their world ranking of seventh and the renewal of their fierce rivalry with the All Blacks is perhaps the most appetising possible outcome from the draw made in Sydney on Wednesday. The potential for a “Bledisloe Cup” opening match to kick off the global showpiece, on 1 October 2027 in Perth, will be a hugely attractive prospect. Chile, playing at their second Rugby World Cup after their debut in France in 2023, and debutants Hong Kong are also in Pool A. England, who won the tournament in Australia 22 years ago, have been pitted against Wales, with Tonga and Zimbabwe the other sides in Pool F. Wales defeated England at their home tournament a decade ago before a second loss, to Australia, consigned the hosts to an early exit. South Africa, ranked No 1 in the world and champions at the past two editions, have been drawn in Pool B against Italy, Georgia and Romania. Rassie Erasmus’s powerful team are widely backed to win a third straight title. Ireland and Scotland have been thrown together again. They met in Paris at the 2023 edition and at the 2019 tournament in Japan. Ireland’s 36-14 victory two years ago sent Gregor Townsend’s side home at the pool stage. Portugal, one of the star turns in 2023, and Uruguay complete the Pool D lineup. Argentina, Fiji, Spain and Canada are in Pool C and France, Japan, USA and Samoa are in Pool E. There will be 52 matches, up from 48 in 2023, with the final on 13 November in Sydney. The match schedule will be revealed on 3 February 2026."

On the eve of the game Ben Stokes said the decision had been made because of the unique challenges of a day-night match at the Gabba and Jacks’s greater quality with the bat. “We tried to look at how we thought spin was going to be used, and there was a bit of a tactical element to it,” Stokes said. “Jacksy’s ability with the bat, to have that down the order for us is useful as well. But if it ever comes down to picking our best, No 1 spinner, selection will go the other way. “We thought this was the best XI for the conditions and the circumstances of the game, but he knows that if it comes down to picking our best spinner he’s the man.” Bashir will play for the Lions in their unofficial Test against Australia A that starts in Brisbane on Friday. Jacob Bethell will also be getting match practice in the game. Jacks has been selected in place of Mark Wood in the only change to the team that lost the first Test in Perth inside two days. Wood has been ruled out because of soreness in the left knee that required surgery this year, but he remains with the squad. He hopes to play some part in the series, with the third Test in Adelaide a fortnight away. “It’s a little bit of a setback, but we’re doing everything we can and the medical group are doing everything they can to try and get him to potentially be available for selection in the last three,” Stokes said. “We’ve got a lot more time to go on this tour and we’ll just see how things play out with that.” Stokes also paid tribute to the former England batter Robin Smith, who died on Tuesday. “I didn’t know him overly well,” he said, “but I knew quite a lot of people who did know him very well, who played a lot of cricket with him, and the same thing kept on coming up, which was just that he was an absolute belter of a bloke. “He was around in Perth and he spoke to the Lions. News like that hits you a bit harder when you know that just last week he was there chatting with the Lions, that he was at the game, talking to people and going into quite a lot of detail about his life and opening up quite a lot. It hits a bit harder when you realise it was only a week ago he was doing those kinds of things.”"

Bec Thomas, an independent member of the Tasmanian legislative council, revealed in a statement on Wednesday morning additional conditions provided by the government means she will vote in favour of the Macquarie Point proposal. Fellow independents Casey Hiscutt and Tanya Rattray also backed the project during Wednesday’s debate in the upper house, clearing a path for the project which has been pursued since 2019. Their support now means, barring an 11th-hour backflip from a member of Tasmania’s upper house, the project will go ahead, enabling the Devils to enter the AFL in 2028. “This has been the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make,” Thomas said. “For me, the question has been under what conditions could it possibly earn support. That’s why my support for the project is strictly conditional on economic, governance, design and community safeguards that seek to protect the welfare of Tasmanians.” Thomas claimed to have secured a fixed cap on the state’s contribution to the project, additional independent oversight, more funding for grassroots sport and targets for local jobs as part of the project. The crossbenchers’ support tipped the balance of the 15-member upper house towards the project, which is a condition of the AFL’s agreement with the Tasmanian government to give the state a licence to play in the national competition. It also devastated the huge group who oppose the stadium proposal, which was widely criticised by an independent planning assessment in September. Greens’ MLC Cassy O’Connor said on Wednesday afternoon she had to change her speech to the upper house at the last minute. “We know now how the vote will almost certainly go,” she said. “So laying out all the evidence, the irrefutable, independent, expert evidence, for why this order [for the stadium] should be resoundingly rejected seems moot now.” The stadium needs the votes of eight MLCs in Tasmania’s upper house, after already winning support of the lower house last month. The independent-dominated 15-member upper house chamber has three representatives from each of the Labor and Liberal parties which support the stadium, but the president – Labor’s Craig Farrell – will not ordinarily vote. A final vote on the stadium is expected on Thursday."
sport_2025_dec_03_terence-crawford-stripped-wbc-title-hamzah-sheeraz.txt,sport,2025-12-03,Bryan Armen Graham,"Terence Crawford dethroned over $300k fee, handing Britain’s Sheeraz title shot",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/terence-crawford-stripped-wbc-title-hamzah-sheeraz,"Terence Crawford has been stripped of his World Boxing Council super-middleweight world title after a dispute over unpaid sanctioning fees, a decision that puts Britain’s Hamzah Sheeraz in line to fight for the vacant belt. The WBC announced on Wednesday that it had removed the American star as its champion, three months after he shocked Canelo Álvarez in Las Vegas to become undisputed at 168lb. The organization said Crawford had not paid its required fees from that victory or from his previous bout in 2024, despite “multiple” attempts to contact him and his team. With the title now vacant, the WBC has ordered its interim champion Christian Mbilli to face Sheeraz for the belt. The 26-year-old from Ilford made an explosive arrival to the division in July when he demolished local favorite Edgar Berlanga at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens. A win over Mbilli would make Sheeraz Britain’s newest world champion in one of boxing’s glamour divisions. Crawford’s situation reflects a familiar tension in the sport. Sanctioning bodies such as the WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO all charge fighters a percentage of their purse – typically around 3% – to compete for their belts. The fees have long been controversial, with critics arguing that the organizations wield significant power while operating with minimal oversight. In Crawford’s case, the WBC says it lowered the fee for his fight against Álvarez from 3% to 0.6% because of his reported $50m (£37.6m) purse – an amount believed to be roughly $300,000 – and planned to send most of that money to a charity fund that supports retired fighters. Still, the 38-year-old Nebraskan reportedly did not respond to any communication regarding the payments. “It’s very unfortunate,” WBC president Mauricio Sulaimán said as he announced the ruling at the governing body’s annual convention in Bangkok. He described the lack of reply as “a slap in the face”, though Crawford has not commented publicly and it remains unclear whether the missed payments were a deliberate choice or simply a case of a superstar with other priorities. What is clear is that his reign as undisputed champion has ended almost as quickly as it began. Crawford still holds the WBO, IBF and WBA belts, but has hinted he may drop back down to middleweight for future fights. For Sheeraz, the backroom politics matter far less than the opportunity that has materialized before him. Mbilli, a French-Cameroonian based in Montreal who is unbeaten in 30 bouts, is a high-pressure, high-volume fighter, while the 6ft 3in Sheeraz brings physical advantages of 6½in in height and 3in in reach. Their meeting, yet to be formally scheduled, promises to be one of the most significant British fights of the first half of next year. Already the first man of the four-belt era to fully unify the titles in two different divisions, Crawford did it in a third when scaled two weight classes and won a dominant 12-round unanimous decision over Álvarez before a record crowd of 70,482 at Las Vegas’s Allegiant Stadium, an achievement without precedent in modern boxing. The 168lb title made him a five-weight champion, having previously captured belts from 135lb through 154lb. Two weeks after the career-defining win, Crawford was involved in a contentious police stop in his hometown. Hours after Omaha held a parade in his honor, officers ordered him out of his car at gunpoint during a late-night traffic stop for alleged reckless driving. Video of the incident circulated widely and prompted the police chief to open an internal investigation. Crawford’s security chief said he feared for their safety, while the mayor called for a full review and stressed the importance of maintaining trust between police and the community. No arrests were made."

The showdown between the traditional TransTasman rivals was set in stone at the tournament’s draw in Sydney on Wednesday night and will likely launch the six-week campaign of the 11th Rugby World Cup at Optus Stadium in Perth on 1 October 2027. The Wallabies will enter their home Cup outside the top seedings, ranked No 7 in the world and coming off a winless European tour for the first time since 1958. “We didn’t have a good November, it’s impossible to hide from that,” coach Joe Schmidt admitted last night of Australian rugby’s first 10-loss season. “It was an emotional rollercoaster of a year. But there were glimpses … and we can build on those glimpses.” Australia’s other Pool A rivals are Hong Kong China, playing in their first ever World Cup, and Chile, the world No 17. But the men in gold must still finish at least second in their pool, then win in the Round of 16 knockout stages, possibly against a Japan side coached by Eddie Jones, architect of their disastrous 2023 Cup campaign. The Kiwi-born Schmidt welcomed Australia and New Zealand being cast in the same pool for the first time in World Cup history and duelling at the tournament for the first time since 2015. “It’s exciting,” the 60-year-old said with a grin. “New Zealand will be looking at Australia thinking, ‘We know what we’re up against and it’ll be personal’. It’s a Trans-Tasman battle at a World Cup and I think both teams are going to love it.” The winner of the match will likely top Pool A, and set up a quarter-final with South Africa, should the reigning World Cup champions top Pool B as expected, pitted as they are against underdogs Romania, Georgia, and world No 10 Italy. Aside from Australia v New Zealand, the draw throws together other ancient rivals early too, with Scotland and Ireland meeting in Pool D and England clashing with Wales in Pool F. Mapping the paths and permutations to the finals is something retired Wallabies skipper James Slipper won’t miss. “The mental battle of a home World Cup is a beast in itself,” the veteran said after drawing the pools alongside All Blacks great Dan Carter. “With friends and family in the stands comes expectation. The Wallabies will feel that pressure but if they can deal with it, a home crowd can be really powerful.” And as Japan proved with their shock defeat of South Africa in the first pool game of the 2015 World Cup, rankings count for nothing in a World Cup furnace. With 250,000 international visitors expected to attend RWC 2027 and A$1.3bn projected to be splashed by travelling rugby fans across the seven host cities, Australian rugby and its fans will come out a winner, regardless of how the Wallabies perform. Although Schmidt will hand over Australia’s World Cup campaign to incumbent coach Les Kiss from mid-2026, he denied there were plans to stay on in any official role. “I’ll be in the stadium watching,” he smiled. “Rugby World Cups are special. Atmosphere builds into a crescendo on match days. I’m excited it’s only two years away now … but in other ways I can’t wait to not be involved because it’s pretty nerve-racking!” Wallabies fans know how Schmidt feels. After winning World Cups in 1991 and 1999, the code has slipped way behind Australian Rules and rugby league in the affections of fans, sponsors and broadcasters. But winning regularly in 2026 and playing the hard-running, crash-tackling blitzkrieg style Kiss favours could turn fortunes fast. “The challenge is to win seven games straight,” says Slipper. “That takes discipline.” Schmidt pointed out Australia may have four Tests against New Zealand in 2026 and 2027 before they meet at the Cup, plenty of time to size up and maybe sucker punch their old foes. And there’s a warm-up starting next year too. “In 2026 the Nations Championship will see these 24 teams go head-to-head in preparation for the World Cup,” said the body’s chairman, Brett Robinson. “That’s fabulous for our sport.” Pool A: New Zealand, Australia, Chile, Hong Kong China Pool B: South Africa, Italy, Georgia, Romania Pool C: Argentina, Fiji, Spain, Canada Pool D: Ireland, Scotland, Uruguay, Portugal Pool E: France, Japan, USA, Samoa Pool F: England, Wales, Tonga, Zimbabwe"

Jon Ridgeon, the governing body’s chief executive, said that while the proposals had gone well in trials, “you ultimately do not want to go to war with your most important group of people”. The idea of introducing a wide takeoff zone was to reduce the number of foul jumps with athletes no longer required to try to hit a narrow board before jumping into the sand pit. However the Olympic long‑jump champion, Miltiadis Tentoglou, described the proposal as “dog shit” because it took much of the skill out of the event, while the former track and field athlete Carl Lewis, who won four Olympic long‑jump medals, called it an “April fool’s joke”. “The athletes do not want to embrace it,” Ridgeon said. “So we’re not going to do it. Even though I would argue we identified a problem, and found a viable solution, if the athletes don’t want it, fine, we drop it. But I don’t regret looking at that. It’s our job as the governing body.” World Athletics trialled the idea this year after research found that around a third of long jumps at championships were no-jumps and that reduced the interest of fans. “From the emotional reaction of the crowd, they lose energy with no‑jumps,” Ridgeon said. “We said: ‘Can we solve that exam question?’ And we created the concept of a wider takeoff zone. We trialled that solution and it trialled well.” When it was tested at two events, World Athletics found the number of no‑jumps dropped to 13% and spectators enjoyed the new format. Most of the athletes, however, remained implacably opposed – but Ridgeon said World Athletics did not lament attempting to improve the event. “We would be accused of being asleep at the wheel if we didn’t look for weaknesses,” he said. “The long jump’s a really exciting and vibrant part of our sport. But it’s our job to push the boundaries and say: ‘Can we make something that’s good even better?’ “That’s what we try to do. Where I was slightly frustrated is that everyone just jumped on that one thing when we were looking at four or five things to improve and speed up the long jump. “They include simple things like getting the officials to rake the pit quicker. We’re also working with [the watch manufacturer] Seiko to create a concept called instant results. When you land in a sandpit at the moment it might take up to 20 seconds to get the result. We’re working on less than five seconds.”"

Brisbane 2032. “This is our time,” the Paralympic swimming and wheelchair basketball champion Ellie Cole says in the two-and-a-half-minute hype reel. “Our moment to believe.” “Belong,” the sprinter Patrick Johnson adds. “Become,” the Paralympian Madison de Rozario concludes. Sign up: AU Breaking News email For this is the “Games vision” of the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, revealed on Wednesday afternoon, after what organisers described as “the largest consultation process Brisbane 2032 has undertaken to date”. Led by communication consultancy Rowland, this three-word vision was formed after “more than 6,000 Australians had their say”, according to the press release. For the Brisbane 2032 president, Andrew Liveris – as it was for West Florida Baptist church’s Mike Brown – they were more than just words. “Our Games Vision has significant symbolism behind it, with the genesis of each word acting as our north star towards the delivery of our Games in 2032 and an exciting era beyond,” Liveris said. The advertising director Dee Madigan, however, reckons those words may have had a different origin story. A regular panellist on Gruen Planet – the ABC show that unpicks the world of advertising – Madigan says the Olympic slogan feels “strange and Christian schooley”. “I think they’ve stolen the school motto from pretty much every Christian school in the country!” she tells the Guardian. “Become? Become what?!? Become someone stuck in a traffic queue? Become someone who is paying an inordinate amount of money for a bottle of water?” After an involvement in Labor campaigns, including leading its advertising for the successful 2022 and 2025 federal efforts, Madigan says she understands that coming up with a slogan “where you have got a plethora of stakeholders” is a difficult task. In 2008 the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee announced the motto of the Beijing 2008 Games as the slightly ominous One World, One Dream. Organisers of Paris 2024 seemed to be riffing of a Stanley Kubrick erotic thriller when they created the motto Games Wide Open, while those of South Korea’s 2018 Winter Olympics might have commissioned a wifi provider to dream up theirs: Passion. Connected. “By the time everyone puts their two bobs in, you’ve usually ended with 27,000 words – I understand how difficult that can be,” Madigan says. “But they have done a terrible job. It feels lazy and weirdly evangelistic.” Madigan says the slogan is a missed opportunity that could have been a promotional tool for visitors, or stoked a sense of pride. It could have been a play on Australian vernacular. It might have been humorous, spoken to the Aussie spirit of Queensland idiosyncrasy. “People are gonna come here and think we’re all holy baby Jesus people,” she says."
sport_2025_dec_04_england-australia-ashes-second-test-day-one-match-report-joe-root-century.txt,sport,2025-12-04,Ali Martin at the Gabba,Root finally makes century in Australia and late burst gives England edge after Starc salvo,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/04/england-australia-ashes-second-test-day-one-match-report-joe-root-century,"It was one of the most intense opening days to a Test match in recent memory. The Gabba was like a cauldron, the air as thick as soup, and with the pink ball zipping around for Mitchell Starc as he continued his bulldozing start to the series, the pressure on England felt relentless. And yet at 8.38pm local time all this melted away as Joe Root tickled Scott Boland fine for four to seal his 40th Test century and – far more notably – his first on Australian soil at the 30th time of asking. Root insisted this tour was never about addressing the gap in his otherwise stellar CV but, even with a cheeky shrug upon doing so, the sense of relief was palpable. How England needed Root, with Starc’s latest sublime figures of six for 71, plus some more self-inflicted wounds, threatening to derail their Ashes moonshot inside three days. By stumps they had reached 325 for nine from 74 overs with Root 135 not out – a foothold in the match and a pushback more broadly after 11 days of being tarred and feathered since Perth. That foothold owed plenty to an unbroken 10th-wicket stand worth 61 runs in which Jofra Archer crashed two sixes and a four to reach 32 not out. The tension lifted from Root’s shoulders and fed into this late salvo, as a day that began with the latest new-ball rampage from Starc – and a familiar sense of English dread – ended with a very different complexion overall. Root was in on the fun here, capping off three sessions and 202 balls of focus by bringing out his famous – occasionally infamous – reverse scoop. Boland was his mark, Root flipping the bat to send a flash of pink soaring over third man. For the first time all day, a number of Australians in the stands were audibly angry with their side letting things slip. And to think Root had gambolled out to the middle only 15 minutes into proceedings, England five for two after Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope had been wiped out for the first of four English ducks on the day. Had Steve Smith held on to his edge on two – diving to his left when it was dropping short of first slip – this much-hyped Ashes series would probably have been done. Zak Crawley deserves credit for his role here, compiling 76 from 93 balls in a stand worth 117 runs for the third wicket alongside Root. After starting the series with a pair, Crawley proved a fair bit, leaving well and slotting 11 crisp fours when opportunities arose. The dismissal was soft – an under-edged pull off a long hop – but it was an encouraging upturn overall. Australia held back Pat Cummins, despite all the pre-match hints of a return. And they also benched Nathan Lyon for the first time at home in nearly 14 years. With Josh Hazlewood still on the sidelines, and the support cast of Michael Neser and Brendan Doggett a level below, this was a day to cash in on winning the toss, not fritter wickets away. Most maddening of all was the sight of Harry Brook falling to a wild drive off Starc two balls into his long-awaited twilight spell. This was a notable scalp for Starc, his 415th wicket to overtake Wasim Akram as the most prolific left-arm seamer in Test cricket. But with England 176 for four at this stage, the floodlights starting to take over, it was such a poor choice from the vice-captain. And then there was Ben Stokes, who rode out his reunion with Starc and helped steer his side to 196 for four by the second interval. He and Root had spent more than an hour chiselling out 34 runs in the toughest visibility conditions of the day, only for a misjudged single – and a superb pick-up and throw from Josh Inglis at point – to get the Gabba rocking once more. When Jamie Smith was bowled by Boland for a second-ball duck – a hint of movement exposing a yawning gate – England were teetering on 211 for six. Their insurance policy kicked in here, at least, Will Jacks walking out at number eight and putting on 40 with Root. That said, a reckless drive to slip on 19 when his partner was on 98 was yet another head-scratcher. As superb as Starc was en route to a second five-wicket haul of the series, likewise Alex Carey with a wicketkeeping clinic capped off by a swirling catch off Gus Atkinson running back, this was Root’s day – a day when the clouds of three unsuccessful tours in the past finally parted. Parking the late dabs until well into his groove, and riding out long periods without scoring a boundary, he climbed a personal mountain. Steve Smith was the first to shake Root’s hand, his earlier chance at slip the only true sliding doors moment in the innings (despite a couple of reviews burned trying to atone). It was a lovely gesture: one all-time great showing respect to another, about which there can now surely be no doubt."

The injury occurred less than three minutes into Wednesday night’s win over the Detroit Pistons. Antetokounmpo collapsed without contact as he tried to get back on defense and immediately reached for his lower right leg. Teammates helped him to his feet, and he walked gingerly to the bench before heading to the locker room. Bucks coach Doc Rivers said after the game that preliminary imaging ruled out an achilles injury, easing initial concerns. Antetokounmpo, who turns 31 on Saturday, recently missed four games with a left groin strain but had played Milwaukee’s previous three contests. The setback came hours after ESPN reported that Antetokounmpo is weighing his future with the Bucks. Charania reported that he and his agent, Alex Saratsis, have been in dialogue with the team about whether Milwaukee remains the ideal long-term fit for the two-time NBA Most Valuable Player. Rivers, speaking before tipoff, dismissed that characterization, saying there had been “no conversations” of that nature and insisting that Antetokounmpo “loves Milwaukee and he loves the Bucks”."

The Giants need him to start acting like a quarterback,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/04/jaxson-dart-says-the-nfl-isnt-soccer-the-giants-need-him-to-start-acting-like-a-quarterback,"Jaxson Dart wants you to know something: this is real football. It’s not soccer or flag. It’s tackle football, the kind where quarterbacks go airborne. After taking the latest in a growing compilation of bone-crushing hits, Dart brushed himself off and delivered a post-game sermon on toughness. “We’re not playing soccer,” he said. “You’re going to get hit. Things happen.” Yet these “things” continue to happen to Dart at an alarming rate. In his eight NFL starts, he has absorbed as many unnecessary hits as any rookie quarterback in recent memory. On Monday night, Dart took another heavy hit near the sideline in the first quarter of the Giants’ 33-15 loss to the Patriots. Dart scrambled out of the pocket on second-and-13 and ran for a first down. As he approached the sideline, Dart could have stepped out and gained fewer yards while still moving the chains. Instead, he braced, lowered his shoulder and was sent soaring through the air by Patriots linebacker Christian Elliss. The hit left Peyton Manning, covering the game alongside his brother Eli, speechless. “Obviously, he told me he would run out of bounds if he was near the sideline,” Eli Manning said. “He lied to me.” Dart’s recklessness has become the defining tension of his young career. He plays like a linebacker in a quarterback’s body. There is an old-school charm to his style, a kind of throwback bravado that a fanbase quickly falls in love with. Coaches love it, too, until they remember their job security depends on the quarterback remaining conscious. In another hapless Giants season, Dart has been one of the few sources of promise. His dynamism has brought a jolt to an otherwise moribund offense. And that’s what a team expects when they trade up to draft a quarterback in the first round. But the physical cost has been too steep. It’s not just the rah-rah coaches or macho fans who love his yards-at-all-costs attitude, either. There is a segment of former players who see Dart’s recklessness as laudable, as a young quarterback on a struggling team fighting for everything. “I don’t know when it became OK for us to tell a player to be less competitive,” ESPN’s Dan Orlovsky said in the aftermath of Dart’s latest hit. But Orlovsky is wrong. A quarterback refusing to embrace contact is not weakness. It’s about understanding the stakes, acknowledging that for his team to have a chance, he needs to stay upright. Dart’s style is dangerous. It’s a danger to himself, his long-term health and the future of the Giants. There’s a sense that if a quarterback plays with the mindset of the other 21 players on the field, the guys in his huddle will rally around him. But, more than anything, the rest of the locker room want him on the field. They have mortgages to pay, and contracts to earn. Their own careers – the hits they take and the sacrifices they make – rest on the starting quarterback being fit. Toughness in a quarterback is admirable, but availability is priceless. Too often this season, Dart has missed snaps and games due to taking unnecessary punishment. He hasn’t just absorbed hits, he’s dished them out. We know more than ever about the consequences of blows to the head. The league has made significant strides in reducing the overall volume of concussions during games. Repetitive head impacts are baked into the sport, with long-term consequences like Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) an endemic part of the game. In the past year alone, nine former and current NFL players under the age of 48 have died, according to The Nation. Of those nine, seven were the result of suicide or undisclosed reasons. We can never say for sure that CTE led to all seven of those deaths, but they hint at the long-term damage repetitive head impacts can cause, let alone the immediate and long-lasting effects of sustaining a single concussion or multiple concussive blows within weeks. But Dart has continually scoffed at the idea that he should change his style. “I watch quarterbacks who play kinda like me around the league,” Dart said after the Patriots game. “I watch how Josh Allen plays, I watch how Patrick Mahomes plays. They take hits, too. I’m not an anomaly here.” Every quarterback takes hits. But there’s a difference between taking them and chasing them. The Elliss hit did not trigger the concussion protocol. But it’s a place Dart has found himself too frequently in his young career. Allen has sustained one documented head injury during his career. In college and the pros, Mahomes has had three documented concussions in 12 years. Dart has already been in the league’s concussion protocol four times in his rookie season, including preseason. A hit in Chicago ruled him out for two weeks with a concussion, his first documented case in the NFL. For Dart, this is nothing new. It’s how he’s always played. During the pre-draft cycle, the quarterback sat down with Jon Gruden for his show The QB Class. Gruden, infatuated with Dart’s potential, treated him like a parent scolding a toddler. “You’re a reckless son of a bitch,” Gruden said. “You’re kind of like Evel Knievel.” Dart grinned, because of course he did. He thought it was a compliment. But Gruden kept hammering the point. You won’t go out of bounds, he said. You won’t slide. Prophetically, Gruden told Dart: “You’re going to be in that concussion protocol tent, and I’m gonna be holding the gameplan like, ‘Where the hell is Dart at?’” Dart was finally pushed to admit the truth: It’s not smart. Then came the tell: “Any time I get hit, I want to fall two yards forward,” he said. That’s great in college, where a quarterback may start for one or two years before they advance to the NFL. But in the pros, that mindset for a quarterback is selfish. Their career is supposed to be long. The future of the franchise – from ownership, to players, to coaches and everyone in the building – rests on the arm of the quarterback. The players are also bigger, faster and stronger. Gaps close quicker. Players hit harder. And defenders’ careers are staked on blasting the opposing quarterback, no matter the short or long-term consequences. It is a merciless profession. But Dart hasn’t shown any willingness to change. Even in his own teammates’ comments, there is a degree of resignation. “That’s just how he is. We’re just going to have to keep talking to him,” Giants guard Jon Runyan said. “Maybe he’ll listen to us one of these days.” It’s time for the Giants to protect Dart from himself. If that’s sitting him until he’s ready to take care of himself, then so be it. So far, they have lived with the consequences. The organization drafted Dart as a lifeline for head coach Brian Daboll, a so-called quarterback whisperer who was running out of time and quarterbacks. For a time, the bet looked shrewd. Once installed as the starter, Dart brought renewed verve to the offense. Daboll leaned into the quarterback’s reckless ways, unable or unwilling to separate what Dart could do from what he should do. Daboll’s job was on the line, and so he featured Dart’s athleticism as a runner, offering up more opportunities for him to take hits in the open field. Designed quarterback runs became the building block of the offense. In just seven starts under Daboll, Dart logged 25 designed carries, more than any quarterback in the league. Along with fellow rookie Cam Skattebo, putting their bodies on the line for an extra yard became part of the team’s lunch pail mantra. But the approach faltered. Daboll was fired after the Giants started the season 2-8. He was relieved in part because he failed to protect the young quarterback. Both because he didn’t have his best quarterback on the field in key spots, and because the Giants recognize the future of the franchise rests on the health and development of their rookie. If he’s hurt, he cannot develop. And his injury record will already raise questions about his viability as a long-term starter. Daboll was already on thin ice. Earlier in the season, he wandered into the blue tent during one of Dart’s concussion evaluations, before getting into an animated discussion with the team’s doctor on the sideline. It was coaching desperation masquerading as concern, which earned him a $100,000 fine and the franchise an additional $200,000 penalty. In Daboll’s final game in charge, the bill for the season came due: Dart hit his head against the turf and was removed from the game after his fourth concussion evaluation of the season. Sprinkle in ankle and hamstring injuries, and you have a young quarterback taking punishment at a scary rate. In his first start under interim coach Mike Kafka, Dart had zero designed rushing attempts. It’s a clear effort from the team to force Dart to try to alter his style in the final weeks of the season. Yet on a rushing attempt out of the coach’s control, Dart refused to give up on a play when the going was good. Dart may insist that this is who he’s always been. Fine. But the NFL is not high school or college football. The stakes are too high, the punishment too severe. It’s not a place where quarterbacks can out-tough linebackers or run through a safety’s face during a meaningless blowout. The best quarterbacks develop a sixth sense for when the extra yard is worth the bruise and when it’s not. But right now, Dart’s impulse is off. He plays as if pain is the point. At times, it’s thrilling. It’s also unsustainable. “We’re not playing soccer out here,” he said. No, he’s not. But this is the NFL, where the bravest thing a quarterback can sometimes do is step out of bounds and live to play another down."
sport_2025_dec_04_lando-norris-oscar-piastri-max-verstappen-mclaren-red-bull-f1-title-race.txt,sport,2025-12-04,Giles Richards in Abu Dhabi,Lando Norris rules out asking McLaren for team orders to help F1 title bid,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/04/lando-norris-oscar-piastri-max-verstappen-mclaren-red-bull-f1-title-race,"Lando Norris would not want McLaren to have to use team orders to aid him in winning his first world championship at the season finale in Abu Dhabi this weekend. Both he and his teammate, Oscar Piastri, insisted they had not yet discussed the potential use of orders for the decisive grand prix. Norris goes into the 24th and final race of the season as favourite but still in a close, high-pressure fight with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and Piastri, enjoying a 12-point lead on Verstappen and 16 on Piastri. Norris will take his first title if he finishes in front of both his rivals or claims third place or better. Verstappen would need to win and hope Norris finishes outside the podium places while Piastri would need to win and have Norris finish sixth or lower. The question of team orders and McLaren’s attempts to be scrupulously fair to both drivers by allowing them to race has been a major point of debate all season. However, when asked about the possibility of team orders being implemented for Piastri to cede to Norris should Verstappen otherwise be able to win, the British driver insisted he believed it would not be fair to ask his teammate to do so. “No, not been discussed,” he said. “Honestly, I would love it. But I don’t think I would ask it. It’s up to Oscar if he would allow it. I don’t think it’s necessarily down to me. It’s the same if it’s the other way around. “Would I be willing to or not? Personally, I think I would, just because I feel like I’m always like that and that’s just how I am. But it’s not really up to me and I’m not going to ask it. I don’t want to ask it because I don’t think it’s necessarily a fair question. If that’s how it ends and Max wins, then, well, that’s it. Congrats to him and I look forward to next year.” The team’s position has always been that they would let their driver’s race freely while both were still in the title fight. However, they have intervened in order to maintain pre-agreed arrangements. At Monza, McLaren had Piastri cede a place to Norris, which the British driver lost through a slow pit stop. After the last round in Qatar the McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, said the team would discuss relevant scenarios so all parties were clear going into the final round. There is no doubt McLaren want to secure their first world championship since 2008, when Lewis Hamilton won. The most likely scenario where Piastri might be required to give way to his teammate would be if Verstappen was leading with Piastri third and Norris fourth and the pair switching would ensure the British driver secured the title. With the three title protagonists lined up together in the press conference at the Yas Marina circuit on Thursday, sat beside the trophy one of them will win on Sunday night, Piastri added that he had yet to be apprised of the team’s expected position. “It’s not something we’ve discussed,” he said. “Until I know what’s expected, I don’t really have an answer.” Aware of the importance of the weekend, McLaren cancelled Norris’s usual session of speaking to the British media, which takes place on the Thursday before every race, with the 26-year-old doubtless happy to not have to answer more questions about his title chances. However, in the official press conference he did address what it would mean to him to win it. “This has been my whole life, it’s everything I’ve worked towards my whole life, so it would mean the world to me, it would mean the world to everyone that’s supported and pushed me for the 16 years of my life,” he said. “It would mean everything. It would mean my life until now has been a success and I’ve accomplished that dream I had when I was a kid.” Mercedes’ George Russell, meanwhile, said it would be “unacceptable” to ask Piastri to move aside and sacrifice his own title ambitions even if that meant Verstappen won the title. “I don’t think it’s acceptable or reasonable to ask a driver who’s also in a shot of a championship in the very last race to move over for your teammate,” Russell said. “They both need to be given a shot and if they lose out because of it, you just need to say the other guy did a better job and that’s racing.”"
sport_2025_dec_04_majestic-joe-root-glory-down-under-harry-brook-folly-ashes-england-australia.txt,sport,2025-12-04,Barney Ronay,Joe Root is finally a wizard in Aus after Harry Brook’s Bazball scarecrow act,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/04/majestic-joe-root-glory-down-under-harry-brook-folly-ashes-england-australia,"In the end even the celebration was perfect, out there under that strange deep-blue southern sky, in the frenzy of the game-state – manic Baz energy, England’s lower order scything away death cult-style at the other end, the way even the grass seems lacquered and glazed by the lights. So yeah. All that stuff. In the middle of this Joe Root guided the ball away through fine leg to complete his first Test hundred in Australia, then marked it with a gentle smile and a wave of the bat, no fist-punching, no monkeys off backs, no angsty and pointed messaging. But, then if you know, you know. Imagine trying to explain to someone who hasn’t followed the story why this was not just warm, uplifting and cathartic, but quietly epic, a moment caught for ever in its own square of space and light. A man who already had 39 hundreds in this starchy formal dance of a sport has now scored his 40th. But follow the story, the craft, the jags in the road, the pieces this thing takes out of you along the way. And at the end of it you have one of those great self-contained sporting moments, the sense of emotional connection through all the surrounding hoopla, the way Test cricket in particular can make you feel you know someone intimately just by watching them move and work and fail and come back. There will, of course, be plenty of banter-war stuff to be resolved on all sides now. Is Joe Root finally great? Is he Australian great? Do we have enough? Numbers. Symmetry. Completion. Men in sheds stroking their beards and sighing. At times cricket really does feel like nothing more than lists, pencil stubs, a fussicky ticking of boxes. But there is something more about wanting Root to be great in Australia. It’s not about one-upmanship, or the chance to gloat, to countermand David Warner’s latest thought-blurt. Any Australian who knows about cricket already knows Root is a great cricketer. But you want them to see it too, and to feel it, in the way you want people to love a band you love, or a book or a place. Joe Root being great in Australia. Win or lose, this ennobles everyone’s Ashes. Although, having said that, and if there’s still any slight chance, we do still want to see Matthew Hayden naked. Root’s hundred felt significant in other ways, not least as something solid in the series for this team, a handhold in the glacier, even a basic freeing up. Are England going to win at the Gabba? Don’t know. But Joe Root got a hundred. Did Harry Brook play if not the worst shot of all time, then perhaps the worst shot yet? Yes. He did. Brook was once again tediously conventional in his attempts at being wild and free, not so much punk rock, more the cricket equivalent of David Cameron listening to The Smiths. But Joe Root did also score a hundred. And not just a hundred in Australia, but a brilliant one in genuinely tough conditions, and an innings that might just have saved his team in this series. There were moments of escalation and gear change. After three hours of furious focus Root could be seen whirling himself inside out to produce an outrageous reverse swat over what was now deep fine leg, moving his score to 128 off 194 balls with all the carefree elan of a man hurling a television set out of a 19th floor hotel window, and teeing up the 50 partnership for the last wicket with Jofra Archer as the day started to melt a little and ooze England’s way. Although, naturally, it had to start with the wings already falling off, the drinks trolley floating past his ear, and England’s greatest modern player coming out at two wickets down for five runs. Root was dropped early in the slips by Steve Smith. From there he was into his most ferrety mode, counterattacking with such gentle grace you hardly noticed as he glided into the twenties alongside Zak Crawley, driving stiff legged at everything in his arc, like a guardsman playing croquet. By mid-afternoon England were 175 for three and poised at the jumping off point. Two versions of elite Yorkshire-dom at the crease. Vice-captain and ex-captain. Numbers one and two in the world. And so the question was asked again. Can they be ruthless here? The answer to which was, of course, no. At one end Root was simply being himself, easy, lithe, watchful, killing you softly, working out in real time how to play these angles and this set of lines. At the other one Brook was batting like a man who desperately needs the bathroom, batting like Lord Farquharson swishing at the dandelions with his walking stick. All the while a darkness was coming, shadows creeping across the ground, Brisbane turning a lovely soft green, and the pink ball genius, Mitchell Starc, revving up for the key spell of the day. Do you run towards this danger? Yep. You do. No sighters, no feet. Just throw the hands at it first up. Trust talent, trust vibes. The ball to Brook was full, the edge thick. There is no world where this was a good choice, no cool-guy dynamic where it makes sense. Australia had pretty much handed Brook a cue card. This is a plan. Would you like to be part of it? Oh, you would? It was at least novel in its abjectness. We have seen England bat in Australia like the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz, stiff and brittle with no heart. We’ve seen them bat like the Lion, without a spleen. Now Brook gave us the scarecrow, batting without a brain. We are the stuffed men. We are the hollow men. We are an attitude, a set of slogans. And so one half of this England team continued to collapse in stages, while at the other end Root batted not just for his life, but for everyone else’s too. There is at times something exhilarating about watching this, the lack of care, the let-the-world-burn energy. But it is also increasingly tedious in the refusal to learn, develop, find new things. Chances are being wasted here. We could have been anything that we wanted to be, with all the talent we had. But we decided, a fact we take pride in. We became the best at being bad. Root provided his own quiet rebuke, a triumph for doing your homework, working at your flaws, a hundred off 181 balls, 35 off his last 19 as the day demanded it. England are still in this series because he did the thing, scaled his own final peak, offered a lesson in what talent ultimately means. Are they going to bowl Australia out now, turn things around? Are they going to learn, to become more Bazball with brains, which is, in the end, not really Bazball at all? Not sure. But Joe Root did score a hundred."
sport_2025_dec_04_marco-odermatt-ryan-cochran-siegle-beaver-creek-downhill-world-cup.txt,sport,2025-12-04,Guardian sport and agencies,US skier Ryan Cochran-Siegle kicks off Olympic push with Beaver Creek downhill podium,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/04/marco-odermatt-ryan-cochran-siegle-beaver-creek-downhill-world-cup,"Marco Odermatt of Switzerland won the downhill season-opener Thursday, beating American Ryan Cochran-Siegle in a World Cup race on a tricky but shorter Birds of Prey course. Odermatt finished in 1min 29.84sec to surpass Cochran-Siegle by .30sec. Norway’s Adrian Smiseth Sejersted finished third. The finish line was moved up the hill – and just barely visible by fans in the stands – due to a lack of snow to properly place the safety netting. The 11th race on the course, Odermatt said he was able to attack the steeper sections and carry enough speed through the flatter part. “For me, a perfect race,” Odermatt said. These days, when isn’t it a perfect race for him? Odermatt has won the last two overall World Cup downhill titles. He’s been consistent in the event and hasn’t finished outside of the top seven in a World Cup downhill race since 2023. This was his fifth World Cup downhill win. Odermatt also started the World Cup super-G season with a Thanksgiving win at nearby Copper Mountain. “How do you catch him? I don’t know,” Cochran-Siegle said of Odermatt, who’s won the last four overall World Cup crowns. “I think the rest of the world’s still trying to figure that out.” Cochran-Siegle spent some time in the leader’s box after a smooth run. He’s the first American to be on a World Cup downhill podium in Beaver Creek since Steven Nyman finished third in 2014. The last American racer to win a World Cup downhill at Beaver Creek was Bode Miller in 2011. “It’s cool to stand among those legends,” said Cochran-Siegle, a silver medalist in the super-G at the 2022 Beijing Games. Cochran-Siegle, 32, is the newest standard-bearer of one of American skiing’s most enduring families. The son of 1972 Olympic slalom champion Barbara Cochran, he grew up on the family’s small ski area outside Burlington, Vermont, where generations of Cochrans have learned the sport. He began his career as a promising giant slalom specialist before shifting his focus to the speed events, steadily carving out a place on the World Cup circuit. His path has also been shaped by resilience. Cochran-Siegle has endured a series of serious setbacks – including a major knee injury that required multiple surgeries and a broken neck that threatened to end his career – only to return stronger each time. He claimed his first World Cup victory in 2020 in his 101st start and stunned the field in the Olympic super-G three years ago. Over recent seasons he has become one of the tour’s more consistent performers in downhill and super-G, recording 28 top-10 finishes across the two disciplines. Sejersted notched his first World Cup podium in the downhill. He has two other podium finishes in super-G. His Norwegian teammate, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, finished in 11th place as he took another big step in his return from a serious crash. This was Kilde’s first downhill race since his crash in January 2024. Kilde underwent surgery for a severe cut and nerve damage in his right calf and two torn ligaments in his shoulder. “I’m super happy with how I could control things today,” said Kilde, who also competed in the super-G on Thanksgiving. “I can’t be more satisfied with the feeling that I had in the finish.” Rok Aznoh of Slovenia had a scary crash near the end of the race. He was taken to the hospital to evaluate head and knee injuries. Earlier in the day, organizers announced the super-G race would be moved to Friday with the weather forecast not looking favorable for Saturday. There’s a giant slalom event scheduled for Sunday."

In a series supposed to be defined by Australia’s fast-bowling Big Three, he has done the work as the sole member to make the starting line. With one English wicket left to fall and his tally on six for 46, he was on the brink of the remarkable feat of recording career-best figures for the fourth time in less than 12 months. Joe Root and Jofra Archer swung a few runs away to void that statistical note, but it was still another day (and night) of heavy lifting for the man who so far in this series has carried Australia’s burden. Having passed Harbhajan Singh’s 417 Test wickets in the process Starc, who ended day one with figures of six for 71, is now in the top 15 wicket-takers on the Test all-time list, but the more significant milestone from the overtaking lane was the 414 of Wasim Akram, making Starc the most prolific left-arm quick of all. Until now Wasim has been uncontested as the greatest of his ilk, but with time yet ahead of Starc, the Australian can now make an argument of it. He may average three more runs per wicket, but has needed eight fewer deliveries to take each one, and his recent vintage years have both of those numbers moving in the right direction. Starc’s efforts stemmed the damage but didn’t entirely avoid it, with England ending the day on a score of 325 for nine that could be competitive even without addition if they get their other suit right. As in Perth, Australia’s backup quicks were largely ineffective. Scott Boland and new inclusion Michael Neser bowled some impressive spells early, but only got one wicket each to show for it. Boland got belted in his later spell, while Cameron Green and Brendan Doggett went at five an over throughout. So while Starc has been zooming past milestones, spare a thought for Nathan Lyon, who started the summer needing two wickets to pass Glenn McGrath’s 563, and still does. Barely needed in Perth in the haste of England’s collapses, he has now been left on the sidelines of this match for no discernible reason. It is difficult to understand how professional decision-makers can talk themselves into choosing five fast bowlers for nearly any situation. Going to the cricket without a spinner is like going to the cricket without a box: you might not need it, but you’ll be bloody sorry if it turns out you did. There are often assessments that a pitch or a ball or a format will suit fast bowling. That doesn’t mean that a team needs every bowler to be of one type and none to be of the other. Variety can prove an effective weapon on any surface. When playing an England team that treats six-hitting against spin as a requirement of religious faith, an opponent should welcome that on a ground where each hit needs to travel 80 metres. The first few might, but the sequence cannot hold. If a pitch will be helpful for quicks, it stands to reason that you’d need fewer of them, not more. If a pitch instead requires toil, that is a spinner’s job. In the end, this wasn’t a fast-bowling paradise. There was bounce: some lovely elevation with the new ball, where even Neser’s pace in the low 130s had Alex Carey’s gloves up at clavicle height. A little swing, particularly early. Moments of lateral movement, when Starc had the new ball wobbling like a drunk being ordered to walk a highway line. But when England players applied themselves, in contrast to the self-destruction of half of their top six, there were runs to be had. There were tough overs to be bowled. And with Starc being held back for the dusk session after his early burst of two wickets in two overs, there was no variety in the right-arm seam attack that bedded Joe Root beautifully into what became his unbeaten hundred, not to mention keeping Australia at an appalling 74 overs in the day, denying themselves the option of a new ball to end the evening session. Lyon has played all three pink-ball matches in Brisbane before this one. He started with 40 overs in a match, then 25, then 50. Safe to say he has not been found surplus to requirements. Doggett is promising but had played one Test and taken five wickets, where Lyon can add two zeroes to each of those tallies. Neser had played two Tests for seven wickets. No conditions could be extreme enough to bridge that gap. Had Lyon played, England might have been all out for less, or they might have made hundreds more. Who knows? The point is that the logic is faulty, leaving out someone who has consistently been a performer in pink-ball cricket, let alone across the rest of a vast career. In the end, the fact that Australia came through the day in reasonable shape is down to Starc once again filling in for a full attack, not to the selections that made up the rest of it."

In his absence Joe Root plundered the home side’s all-seam attack for an unbeaten 135 on the opening day at the Gabba, his 40th Test century and his first on Australian soil, an effort teammate Zak Crawley acclaimed as “one of his best”. Lyon, Australia’s all-time third-highest Test wicket-taker, described his mood as “absolutely filthy” as he came to terms with being snubbed. “I’m letting things settle down in my own head and trying to make sure that I’m doing whatever I can to make sure the guys representing Australia do the right thing and get the right result for us,” he told Channel 7. “I’m not the first player to miss a Test match and I won’t be the last. But I’m obviously pretty gutted because I know the role that I can play, and especially at a venue like this.” Australia’s chair of selectors, George Bailey, attempted to assuage Lyon’s fury by guaranteeing him a place in the XI for the third Test. Bailey described the move as a “one-Test decision”, adding: “Nath will disagree with the decision, and that’s perfectly OK. I have no qualms about players feeling like they can impact the game and the fact of the matter is he could have. Very much it’s a one-Test decision, Nath will play in Adelaide.” Crawley admitted that England had been surprised by the decision to leave Lyon out while Mitchell Starc, who added six first-innings wickets to the 10 he took in Perth, said: “It’s a tough one for Nath. Everyone wants to play every game and I’m sure he’ll be disappointed. It’s certainly not a reflection of his skills. They looked at conditions and made the choice of this attack for these conditions.” Root came to the crease in the third over with England reeling at five for two, after both Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope had been dismissed without scoring, and was unbeaten at stumps with England 325 for nine. “He played fantastically well, assessed the conditions, sucked up some pressure and got the result,” Starc said. “We’ve had a lot of good battles – he’s won a few of them and I won a few and today we both got some runs and wickets so we’ll call it even.” Crawley, who scored 76 and combined with Root in a third-wicket partnership of 117, said the Yorkshireman’s performance had been “brilliant”. “I forget some of his hundreds, that’s how many he’s got,” the England opener said. “But it’s a phenomenal knock. It was doing plenty when he first came in and he was so calm and he was so clear about how he wanted to go about it. It has to be right up there. If you put everything into consideration, it’s got to be one of his best.” After England lost three wickets for 13 runs and five for 54, Root and Jofra Archer added a quickfire, 44-ball 61 in an unbroken last-wicket stand to leave the tourists happy with their position at stumps. “We were saying go really hard and it was a win-win: if it comes off then we get quick runs, or if they get out we could have a crack at them under lights,” Crawley said. “So it was a perfect situation for us. They’re valuable runs but it would have worked out either way. We were pretty happy with 260 and having an hour at them to be honest, but I think we definitely won that last hour, so we’re positive going into tomorrow.”"

I was fearing for Crawley when I should have been worrying about Ben,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/04/oh-duckett-i-was-fearing-for-crawley-when-i-should-have-been-worrying-about-ben-ashes-cricket,"“Must be amazing to be in Australia for the Ashes, what’s the atmosphere like?” It’s an understandable, if slightly daft question. Brett Lee isn’t in my house. I don’t wake up next to a furious Jonathan Agnew. “WHY AREN’T YOU IN CANBERRA, MAX?” I’m 850 miles from Brisbane. Apart from me the atmosphere is one of wild indifference amongst the family. The good news is I’m hosting the Guardian Ashes Weekly podcast - now a professional excuse to watch another five (or two) days of agony. I’m just another terrified England fan wondering what I’m about to put myself through. So here is just the first hour of play, not quite minute-by-minute - if you got up at 4am (GMT), perhaps it felt the same for you. 2.31pm. A hipster Fitzroy North Cafe. The toss on the laptop. Ben Stokes calls tails. It is tails. Suddenly I panic for Zak Crawley. Twenty-nine minutes until he gets another duck. But he’s so tall, surely that will help. Will he leave one outside the off stump? Michael Vaughan is in a McDonalds advert, poking his head over the fence like the neighbour in Home Improvement. I pay for my eggs and cycle to the supermarket. An irate Aussie on a moped yells at a BMW. “Get in your fucking lane, you wanker” He sounds his horn. One of those pathetic moped horns. Eeeeeeeee. Good fun. I open the Channel 7 app on my phone. Stuart Broad is feeling for Zak Crawley. We’re all feeling for Zak Crawley. I buy a lottery ticket. It’s muggy in Melbourne – it hits you when you go outside. It’s a windy heat that buffets into you, the like of which you don’t get in an English summer. How will that affect things at the Gabba? 2.59pm. I’m home. Matthew Hayden is in a massive cowboy hat – he makes a jingoistic pitch for Queensland. England “talented – you betcha, tough? Not so sure. You could walk to the moon and back in the time since England’s last win here”. First ball – Mitchell Starc to Zak Crawley – a nation waits in terror as Starc begins his run up. HE LEAVES IT! A LEAVE! WE COULD WIN THIS TEST. The bounce is steep. Panic again. Don’t get out don’t get out don’t get out don’t get out. Ball two. Fishing outside off. You can leave those on height Zak. Ball three is on the money. Ball four - he drives! Four runs! Here we go. Somebody say ‘big long levers’. And then a single. My heart rate just lowers. Mrs Rushden is in the playroom with 10-month-old Willie asking for a break. Am I going to get the full morning session? It feels unlikely. OH BUGGER. Duckett out first ball. We spent all our time worrying about Zak Crawley. Why didn’t we worry about Ben Duckett? I’m to blame – I wasn’t even concentrating. Just leave it, get forward to it, something that isn’t edging it to first slip. To be fair to the left-hander, it’s not a bad ball first up. Starc is so ruggedly Australian – all sweat and limbs and hair and grit. He could be selling you a cow or making you a strong three-quarter flat-white. Enter Ollie Pope. I’m joined by Willie – he’s hitting everything with a pink felt tip pen – he doesn’t appreciate the stress i’m under - he’s half Australian, win win for him. Michael Neser is swinging it. You can relax when it’s not Starc. A second later and he beats the bat. You can never relax. Ah, Ollie Pope. It’s impossible to write this without saying the F word repeatedly. Just leave it outside the off stump. Surely there’s been some self-reflection since Perth. Surely. IT ISN’T THERE TO BE HIT. The whole Ashes is disappearing before our eyes. 3.15pm. Joe Root’s at the crease, too early again. Root plays and misses. Willie is playing a “hit the frog” game next to me. He clambers onto my legs and pulls the hair out of its roots, I wince in pain. But in a way it’s a welcome relief to focus on something else for a millisecond. Root edges an impossible chance to Steve Smith. Two for 11. Willie picks up a loose tile from the fireplace and puts some dirt in his mouth. 3.18pm. Another boundary for Crawley. He looks so good. It’ll be such a blow when he holes out for 27. Suddenly Neser cuts him in half with a good length ball. Lovely cover drive next ball. Go on Zak, get a double century. Neser beats the bat. Was that a tiny nick? Is this the turning point? An advert for wind power or pensions or something. Thirty seconds of calm, just some footage with no Mitchell Starc. There won’t be a wicket while a man is in a hi-vis looking at a wind turbine talking about superannuation. Root leaves a wide one outside the off stump. The relief of a dot ball. And another leave. Oh joy. Neser to Root. Mrs Rushden yells from the garden. Young Willie has followed through in the paddling pool. Is the ball settling down? Don’t write that. Crawley is seeing it like a football. Don’t write that either. Don’t even think that. It’s 30-2. Scott Boland’s on – three singles off the over. For six balls, it’s like watching Test cricket from a distant age. Scrap that, Crawley lofts one into the covers – a moment of terror as the camera pans back waiting for a fielder to be underneath it. There’s no one there. Another two off Starc. And then he tries to pull one that lifts over Alex Carey. Calm down, FFS Zak. Crawley’s on 27. Don’t look three paragraphs up. He slams one past Starc for four. It won’t be my fault. An advert for Bundaberg Ginger Beer. Digging soil and old trains and men in fields. Remember when adverts in between overs were the end of Test cricket. Now they’re respite. Crawley whips one off his pads for one. Soft hands from Root for another one. Rotate the strike. It’s all coming together. Boland beats Crawley all ends up. The terror remains. Crawley dances down, they think about a review. The timer goes down. 13, 12, 11. You pray for no review. Don’t do it. Don’t do it. Three, two one … they don’t. And … relax for a moment. Starc leaves the field. Don’t get complacent. Doggett can bowl. The 50 is up. Moments later the 50 partnership is up as Root drives one to the boundary. An hour in, maybe there is hope. Maybe there isn’t. You’ll know by now."
sport_2025_dec_04_report-takes-aim-at-fifa-and-ioc-over-policies-for-athletes-convicted-of-sexual-assault.txt,sport,2025-12-04,Matthew Hall,Report takes aim at Fifa and IOC over policies for athletes convicted of sexual assault,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/04/report-takes-aim-at-fifa-and-ioc-over-policies-for-athletes-convicted-of-sexual-assault,"With the draw for the 2026 Fifa World Cup set to take place on Friday, a report examining the participation of athletes convicted of sexual offences at major sporting events has highlighted significant distrust of international sports governing bodies in how they deal with these situations. The report, titled No One Wants to Talk About It, is the result of interviews with elite athletes directly affected by sexual abuse and is intended to gauge attitudes around the eligibility and accreditation criteria for athletes with prior criminal sexual convictions and their participation at mega sporting events. The athletes highlighted “institutional inaction, silence, or complicity” in a lack of regulation by Fifa and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), among other organizations. The report is a collaboration between the Sports and Rights Alliance and Thomas More University in Belgium. The Sports and Rights Alliance is a coalition that includes Amnesty International, Football Supporters Europe, Human Rights Watch, and World Players Union as well as other trade unions and human rights groups. In the report, athletes surveyed claimed a lack of clear safeguarding policies from professional clubs and federations, an absence of transparent standards for competition eligibility, and inconsistent responses from sports organizations to concerns raised by athletes about potential sexual abuse. One athlete interviewed said sport governing bodies should “start by acknowledging that this is a problem” and “it’s as serious as making sure that there is proper grass,” a reference to controversies relating to high-level soccer matches (particularly within women’s soccer) being played on artificial turf. “Distrust was something that came up in every single interview,” said Joanna Maranhão from Sports and Rights Alliance.. “This is something that we hear over and over again.” The report also found there to be no consistent global approach to the participation of athletes with prior criminal sexual offences at major sporting competitions. “There was a pattern of athletes, particularly male athletes, who commit sexual offences and while sometimes their contract is ended [by a club] their eligibility to participate is not revoked because of those offences,” Maranhão said. “There is a second chance given to people because they are good at a sport but when we experience sexual violence or disclose that we have been impacted by violence it seems like [the response is] ‘Yeah you don’t really belong here. You’re not good enough. You are not tough enough’.” The report highlighted the case of former Real Madrid, Manchester City, and Milan star Robinho, sentenced to prison by an Italian court in 2017 for participating in the rape of a woman in Milan in 2013. His conviction was upheld by Italy’s highest court in 2022 but the player initially avoided prison by remaining in his native Brazil, where laws prohibit the extradition of its citizens. Robinho was eventually jailed in Brazil when a local court upheld the Italian verdict. After his conviction, Robinho remained eligible to play. “This case not only illustrates the global challenges of holding high-profile athletes accountable but also exposes how legal, geographic and cultural barriers can allow offenders to avoid facing the consequences of their actions since [Robinho’s] eligibility to compete has never been revoked,” the report said. Also named is the Villarreal midfielder Thomas Partey. Partey plays internationally for Ghana and was charged this year by the Crown Prosecution Service of England and Wales with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault that allegedly occurred between 2021 and 2022, while he played at Premier League club Arsenal. Partey pleaded not guilty to the charges in a London court appearance in September 2025. He is due to face trial in November 2026, after the Fifa World Cup to be co-hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico. He remains eligible to play for Ghana. “If you look at the cases there is a back and forth between different organizations about who is responsible,” Maranhao said. “They say, no it is not me, it is them. If it’s not the international level it is the national level.” The study acknowledges a complex dilemma between legal rights and ethical considerations to allow individuals convicted of sexual offences to participate in the high level competition. “Legally, individuals who have served their sentences have the right to be reintegrated into society,” the report claims. Maranhão adds: “We have binding documents for doping and for match-fixing and we need to have binding documents related to safe sport. There are strict rules for doping. We need to comply with the Wada code and the Olympic charter but there is not much around safe sport.” It is as yet unclear how US immigration law might affect athletes with criminal convictions participating in the 2026 World Cup or the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Fifa did not respond to a request to confirm its own eligibility rules for its events, who has ultimate jurisdiction for eligibility criteria, or how US immigration laws may affect participants in next year’s World Cup. Earlier this year, the Australian government banned the Netherlands beach volleyball player and convicted child rapist Steven van de Velde from entering Australia for the world championship even though he had been selected to represent the Netherlands at the event. Van de Velde was a member of the Netherlands team at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. Maranhão, a former Olympic swimmer for Brazil, has had success as an advocate for victims of abuse. Her previous work led to the Brazilian government passing a law establishing a 20-year statute of limitations for sexual abuse of children and adolescents. “I participated at four Olympics and I was not screened [for any sports events],” she said regarding background checks for athletes. “Last year I went to a one-day workshop and my accreditation for the event was pending on screening.” “When we talk about harassment and abuse it actually damages the reputation of the sport and we need to shift the focus toward the people that are impacted. It is not as interesting to institutions to make that shift because it will make them look bad. [Sexual] harassment and abuse is way more complex [than doping]. There is this dome of silence and retaliation and a lack of institutional courage to challenge it.”"

Two thousand fans were waiting outside at Royal Melbourne at 6.30am, eager to get to the 10th tee for the Northern Irishman’s first swing at Australia’s premier tournament in a decade. Agitation was building. Time was ticking. Scanning all those barcodes might take half an hour or more. And so on a warm and windy workday in Australia’s biggest city, the gates were flung open. Rory mania had begun. Following the headline group of McIlroy, Adam Scott and Min Woo Lee was a crowd that was four deep around the greens. A mother and daughter, speaking Korean, snuck in front of the mass of men in polos to see the Masters champion record his second bogey – cue the gasps – in the first three holes. A mother called with some urgency to one son, “Where’s Benji?” having lost the other. The pair had been taken out of school, “just for the morning,” given it was a “special” day. As McIlroy sank his bogey putt, they were among half the crowd who vacated for the next tee, unconcerned that Scott’s par putt was still to come. Golf Australia officials look back fondly at the 2011 Australian Open at Royal Sydney featuring Tiger Woods and its crowd of 100,000. Those with longer memories recall the days when Jack Nicklaus came and won the Stonehaven Cup six times in the 1960s and 1970s, when Australia’s fairways were held in the highest regard. Those officials hope this year’s edition will return the Australian Open to its former standing. They expect the crowd record from 2011 to be exceeded at Royal Melbourne. Tickets are exhausted for the weekend at a course that was bursting with about 35,000 fans for the final day of the Presidents Cup in 2019. McIlroy spoke before his round, saying this tournament “deserves” its own place in the calendar due to its history. An appearance fee reportedly as high as $2m might have influenced his choice of words. Yet he seemed genuinely happy to be in Melbourne, even if he admitted he liked the nearby Kingston Heath course more than this one. “It’s probably not the best course in Melbourne,” he said on Wednesday. “That’s my opinion, but certainly in the top 10 in the world.” Many top international players are resting at the end of a long season. Others are playing the Nedbank Golf Challenge in South Africa or a Woods-hosted tournament in the Bahamas. But there are more in Australia thanks to the Northern Irishman. The ranking points players earn from each tournament are affected by the calibre of the field, and McIlroy’s commitment this year (and next) make it a worthwhile stop for top 100 players such as Korean Si Woo Kim, Dane Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen, and Kiwi Ryan Fox. McIlroy, of course, has played the Australian Open before, and was champion in 2013. But he returns in 2025 as perhaps the biggest name in world golf, even if Scottie Scheffler might be its most consistent performer. His commitment helped Golf Australia secure Crown as its naming rights sponsor and ensures the tournament is seen around the world. The world No 2 played one hole at five Melbourne golf courses on Monday for social media content. And tram-themed tee markers help the city’s distinctive charms reach a broader audience. McIlroy’s appeal is aided by the likes of Cameron Smith and Lee, who have helped Australian golf stay relevant to a younger audience. Golf’s ageing participation base is as close as the sport has to an existential threat. So social media-friendly talents like “let him cook” Lee, alongside increasing uptake of social and simulator-based formats, and world-beating Australian women like Minjee Lee, Hannah Green and Grace Kim will help the sport remain relevant in the long-term. Smith, who played in the group behind McIlroy and finished the day at one under, said he was surprised to see so many people at his early tee time. Lee, whose two under leaves him four behind early leader Elvis Smylie, said it was the biggest crowd he has ever played in front of. “Every fairway, every green was full and there was no blank space in between,” he said. But he acknowledged with a grin most were not there for him. Rather, it was all about McIlroy (even if he did struggle in his round, ending one over). Running along a fairway beside McIlroy, one young fan wore his school uniform on Thursday morning, tie swaying in the wind. Another young fan was hanging off a tree, trying to get a precious video, his arm hanging out with iPhone in hand. The volunteer who holds up the “quiet” sign before each shot, a middle-aged woman, snuck a photo of the Masters champ as he approached the 14th tee. A drone buzzed overhead, under attack from two magpies. Body odour, amplified by the ample nylon, was permeating the busy crowds. One gentleman was already taking a business call to help plan the Christmas party. Another jumped on his phone to shoot off an email. But when McIlroy pulled out his driver, there were no distractions."
sport_2025_dec_04_rugby-union-champions-cup-preview.txt,sport,2025-12-04,Robert Kitson,New recipe for success required to stop France’s grands chefs dominating the Champions Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/04/rugby-union-champions-cup-preview,"There was a time when the European Cup had an overwhelmingly Irish flavour. The organisers’ headquarters were in Dublin and between 2006 and 2012 either Munster or Leinster lifted the trophy five times in seven seasons. Everyone else was forced to scrabble around for the last few Tayto crisps in the bag. And now? The tournament, officially known these days as the Investec Champions Cup, has tilted so far towards France you can practically smell the garlic. Admittedly its HQ is now in Switzerland for tax reasons but, financially and on the field, the balance of power lies squarely with les grands chefs of the Top 14. Since 2021, there have been five successive French winners and on three occasions in that time, the Challenge Cup has also disappeared across the Channel. With next May’s final scheduled for Bilbao in the Basque Country, barely 75 miles across the French border, this year’s question is obvious: can anyone stop the seemingly inevitable? Even before a ball is kicked – or an eye is gouged – it feels like something special will be needed to prevent another Gallic procession. Because not only are five of the Top 14’s current top six revving up on the grid but many of their so-called rivals are short of form. Even Leinster sit only sixth in the URC table while Saracens, Sale Sharks, Harlequins and Gloucester are all in the bottom half of the Prem. Scarlets are stone cold last in the URC while the Sharks and the Bulls cannot endlessly flog all their high-class Springboks. Which, realistically, leaves four or five non-French sides in with a puncher’s chance of featuring in the last eight, let alone in the semi-final and final. The DHL Stormers from South Africa are top of the URC while Leinster, Munster, Bath and Saracens just about possess enough squad depth to compete as well. Even then much rests on their ability to thrive away from home in some seriously tough back yards. Take Bath, for example. The English champions simply must beat Munster at home on Saturday night, probably with a bonus point, to give themselves some insurance before their visits to Toulon and Castres either side of Christmas. Lose in Toulon, in particular, and their hopes of topping Pool 2 will be sunk to the Mediterranean sea bed. The opening rounds matter because the format of the competition remains weighted in favour of those who start fast. Earn yourself a top-four seeding and, as Bordeaux and Northampton showed last season, it makes the ride much more manageable. Top two and, if you keep winning, you have the luxury of home country advantage until the semi-finals. So anyone planning to stop the Bordeauxs and Toulouses of this world from booking into Bilbao need to start motoring early. Which means the Stormers cannot afford to slip up on the opening weekend in Bayonne, while the Saints, last year’s finalists, have scant margin for error away to Pau and at home to the Bulls respectively in their first two games. Pau, along with Toulon, will be instructive to watch given they have already beaten Toulouse at home and Bordeaux away in the Top 14 this season. Joe Simmonds – a European champion with Exeter five years ago – has rebooted his career in the south-west of France and his side play a sweeping brand of rugby that can be hard to contain. The same applies to the Saints, but it will require all of Henry Pollock’s joie de vivre for his side to dominate a pool also containing Bordeaux, Bristol and the Scarlets. Unless, of course, the Bulls turn up at Franklin’s Gardens with a below-strength lineup – as has happened in the past – and again undermine the thesis that South African sides would add to the competition. This feels like a significant campaign for Bristol, too, as they hope to show they have the substance at this level to match their fast-moving style. They will be hosting Pau and Bordeaux and travelling to Llanelli and Pretoria and might just make the last 16 if they can keep enough of their key starters fit. Saracens? Durban and Glasgow will pose contrastingly awkward challenges while the bookmakers’ deserved tournament favourites, Toulouse, are also due to visit north London. Antoine Dupont against Owen Farrell, and Maro Itoje, Ben Earl and company against half the French pack? That Sunday fixture in round three in January could be the 80 minutes that shows how narrow – or wide – the gap now is between England’s biggest dogs and France’s wealthier aristocrats. Here is hoping there is a twist in the tale at some stage because, otherwise, a lot of familiar faces will be swigging podium champagne and a last eight comprising of Bordeaux, Leinster, Toulouse, Toulon, Stormers, Pau, Munster and Bath will be no real surprise. Leinster, remarkably, won their most recent gold star in Bilbao more than seven and a half years ago. Repeating the trick grows steadily harder."
sport_2025_dec_04_tnt-sports-the-ashes-champions-league-football-tv-rights.txt,sport,2025-12-04,Matt Hughes,No ‘fire drill’ at TNT after painful loss of Champions League and England rugby,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/04/tnt-sports-the-ashes-champions-league-football-tv-rights,"It has been a tough couple of weeks for TNT Sports, with the loss of three days of Ashes cricket due to England’s two-day defeat in Perth following on from some bruising rights negotiations. On the eve of the first Test, the Guardian revealed TNT had lost UK rights to the Champions League to Paramount+, with Sky Sports picking up the decent consolation prize of Europa League rights, while this week it emerged that TNT has also lost the rights to international rugby union with ITV having paid £80m for the inaugural Nations Championship. Senior figures at TNT are open about being “absolutely gutted” at losing the Champions League, which has been its biggest property since its predecessor BT Sport first bought the rights in 2013, but they do not regret the level of its bid, which was gazumped by Paramount. The value of the UK rights has increased from £1.2bn to £2.2bn, albeit over four years rather than three, with Paramount paying the lion’s share in a joint deal that gives Amazon Prime the first pick of one exclusive match per round. “We have a clear business model, and in rights negotiations there is only a certain level we will go to,” a TNT source said. “BT Sport built an incredible business, but their losses were huge and we could not continue to operate in that way.” A look at TNT’s finances demonstrates why, with the company formed by the merger of Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) and the BT Group in 2022 still losing significant sums. Accounts for TNT Sports Broadcasting Limited submitted to Companies House this year show losses to July 2024 of £148m, although that figure is understood to include numerous exceptional items and start-up costs for the joint venture, which is projected to break even soon. The long-term future for TNT is also unclear, as Warner Bros. Discovery is the subject of a takeover battle that has seen it attract bids from Paramount Skydance, Netflix and Comcast, the owners of Sky Sports. Ironically the loss of the Champions League could help TNT break even in the short term, as offsetting about £1bn of rights fees will present opportunities. While TNT accepts it will inevitably lose subscribers, it is already planning to mitigate that process by buying other rights, and is even considering dropping the price, which was increased to £30.99 per month last summer after the WBD-owned Eurosport ceased operating as a standalone broadcaster with its content added to the TNT platform. TNT has also taken some consolation from the fact that BT Sport did not lose any subscribers when Amazon broke up its exclusive offering by winning the first-pick package of Champions League games for the first time in 2018, since when the breadth of the channel’s coverage has increased considerably. TNT’s strategy since the WBD/BT merger has been to acquire a broader portfolio of content, snapping up international cricket, English club rugby and the FA Cup for the first time this season to supplement Eurosport’s existing offering of the French and Australian Open tennis, World Tour cycling and the Olympics. “It’s not as if there is a fire drill happening,” another TNT source said. “We’ve got 18 months to really think about other opportunities regarding pricing, packaging and buying other rights. We’ve already got a broader portfolio of content than ever before, and the FA Cup seems like a very timely acquisition now.” While losing the Champions League was a shock, TNT walked away from the Nations Championship auction without making a bid, having broadcast the autumn internationals for the past two years. TNT is understood to have regarded that contract as a test of whether international rugby would drive sufficient subscribers to justify a long-term investment, and concluded that it did not. Too many casual rugby fans cancelled immediately after the tournament, with TNT’s year-round offering of the Prem not deemed attractive enough to retain them. As a result, TNT would have wanted a discount on its existing fees to buy the Nations Championship, and with ITV willing to pay £80m for two tournaments the free-to-air broadcaster won the auction unopposed. TNT’s difficulties are not new for companies seeking to take on Sky, who has dominated the UK sports broadcasting market since buying exclusive rights for the first Premier League season in 1992. While BT fared better than most of Sky’s rivals, the cost was stratospheric. Around £200m of annual losses in its sports business was justified on the grounds that it succeeded in driving football fans to buy BT’s broadband services, but with TNT aiming to obtain profitability, it faces an even greater challenge."
sport_2025_dec_04_zak-crawley-handsome-drives-steady-england-australia-ashes-cricket.txt,sport,2025-12-04,Simon Burnton at the Gabba,Zak Crawley’s handsome drives steady England ship and show power of perseverance,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/04/zak-crawley-handsome-drives-steady-england-australia-ashes-cricket,"Anthems over, Zak Crawley left the field and took the water handed to him by Matt Potts. If he was a little dry of mouth it would hardly be a surprise – even without the burden of the brace of ducks he took from the first Test, the situation he was about to walk into might have verged awkwardly close to terrifying. He downed half the bottle, donned his helmet and turned back around. Mitchell Starc, the bowler who dismissed him in the opening over of each innings in Perth and is even more effective in these day-night games, dried his hands on the sun-baked turf as Crawley made his way to the middle, and picked up the new pink ball. Three slips set themselves for some catching practice. Crawley left the first – pitched short, bouncing high – was non-critically bemused by a couple of wobble-seamers, and then punched his fourth through the covers for four, his first runs of the series. There are fewer English flags here than there had been in Perth, but what the travelling fans lacked in signage they made up for in guttural, relieved, desperate roars. A single off the next brought some relief, for him at least. It is hard to argue that England’s opening partnership was good exactly, for all that it was undoubtedly their best of the series so far – a low bar to clear, the challenge involving the accumulation of anything more than no runs. But there are few opportunities less inviting than starting the innings against Australia in a day-night game: of the 29 such partnerships from touring teams this was only the 10th worst and the sixth shortest, and it did not last as long as the opening over. Just seven of those 29 partnerships contributed as many as 20 runs, the same number scored fewer than three, and most didn’t make it to 10. Here Crawley had five before his partner faced a ball, but Ben Duckett didn’t get to face two. At which point many seasoned observers of English travails on Ashes tours would have been bracing themselves for a familiar and depressing few hours. But there had been a lot of talk in the extended gap between the first two Tests about England reflecting on where they had gone wrong in Perth, and it was clear here that some of them had. Ollie Pope, who as in the second innings of the first Test hung out an angled bat and lost his wicket to a ball he should have left alone, in Starc’s second over and with the score still on five, not so much. If Crawley shone here, it was only because he was one of the reflectors. Even then, he had his moments. Crawley had motored to 15 off 16 balls before Michael Neser sent down a delivery that whistled past his bat and nestled in the gloves of the wicketkeeper. The bowler thought there had been contact and may have been right, but this was one of the vanishingly rare occasions when the vague aroma of a wicket fills the air and Steve Smith, Australia’s bloodhound captain, fails to detect the scent. There was also a near re-enactment of his second dismissal in Perth, but if then Starc had dived to his left to take an outstanding return catch, this time his follow-through sent him stumbling to his right, the ball was more cleanly struck, and after a fraction of a second of potential panic Crawley was able to admire its passage to the boundary. There were seven more across the opening session, most handsome drives straight or through cover – and Crawley’s handsome drives are very handsome indeed. Perhaps as the interval approached Crawley’s reflection took him back a little further than Perth a fortnight ago, to the start of the first Test of the last Ashes series. Then he made an excellent start but fell just before lunch, and while in both innings he walked off after a couple of hours’ sterling work having scored precisely 61, this time he was unbeaten. He started the second session explosively, with two more of those impeccable drives, off Brendan Doggett. In the next over Alex Carey came up to the stumps, trying to curtail the comfort with which Crawley was advancing to Doggett and Michael Neser. The immediate reward was another straight drive for four but Carey stayed up, breathing down the batters’ necks, cramping their style. The breakthrough came when he dropped back: the next ball was short, Crawley, off the leash, went for the pull and got a slight bottom edge. For the newly distanced Carey it was an easy catch. Crawley had scored 76. He left the field, eyes on the ground and head shaking. He certainly did not see, and may not even have heard, those standing to applaud. Here was the player England have been willing to persevere with and wait for. Now he has more reflecting to do."
sport_2025_dec_05_england-australia-ashes-second-test-day-two-match-report-cricket.txt,sport,2025-12-05,Ali Martin at the Gabba,England rue five dropped catches as Australia build lead in second Ashes Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/05/england-australia-ashes-second-test-day-two-match-report-cricket,"The ball may be pink and the meal breaks off-kilter, but for so much of the second day in this pivotal day-night Test match, the atmosphere inside the Gabba was an all-too-familiar one for England’s supporters. Gone was the triumphalism that met Joe Root’s first Test century on these shores 24 hours earlier and in its place a creeping sense of dread. The bottom line is: England’s bowlers spent most of the day sending down so many long hops and half-volleys as to make Jackson Pollock look positively precise. Then there was the catching. Five chances went to grass over the course of three sessions, with Ben Duckett and Jamie Smith guilty for a couple apiece to follow their ducks on day one. It is hard enough to take 20 Australian wickets in their backyard at the best of times, doubly so when hands turn into feet under pressure. Yet by stumps, even with two of the reprieved in Alex Carey and Michael Neser having delivered a late flurry of runs, Ben Stokes and his men were, somehow, still in the contest. Australia had been ominously positioned at 291 for three earlier in the evening session, only to close on 378 for six. Their lead of 44 is healthy, no question, just not yet fully decisive. Stokes will have been telling his men as such overnight, even if his radar was as haywire as the rest of them. Not that he can ever be discounted, evidenced by seeing Josh Inglis handed a life by Duckett on 23 and then detonating out the right-hander’s middle stump two balls later. This was day-night cricket at its wildest, with the pink Kookaburra ball coming out to play after dark and events taking on a life of their own. Summing up the chaos was Brydon Carse. He shipped 113 runs from 17 overs, removed two set men in Cameron Green (45) and Steve Smith (61), and yet still bungled a simple chance off Neser before the close. Overall, England also got a dose of the medicine they thought was theirs to dispense before this tour, with Australia rattling along at a tick over five runs per over. The difference was that every time a wicket fell, the incoming batter picked up where their predecessor left off. Green aside, bowled by Carse trying to carve a yorker off his stumps, wickets had to be earned. Another contrast has been the fortunes of the two wicketkeepers. Alex Carey put on a clinic behind the stumps on day one. And though dropped by Duckett at gully first ball in between Carse’s late strikes, the left-hander then delivered a busy unbeaten 46 with the bat that stemmed the bleeding. Overnight, Australia could not have been more grateful for his experience. Jamie Smith is a rookie in comparison, of course, this his first Ashes series and one England will pray sees an upturn sharpish. The 25-year-old dropped a simple chance off Travis Head (33) on three as Australia, driven by Jake Weatherald’s sprightly 72, raced to 130 for one by the end of the first session. He didn’t even move on when Carey offered a chance on 25 later on, the ball flying past Root’s hopeful effort to his right at first slip. Yet despite all the howlers, two of the catches actually held on the day were truly extraordinary. Marnus Labuschagne made 65 to confirm his resurgent form but teammates will probably hear more about his diving effort in the deep first thing. It removed Jofra Archer for 38, shut down England for 334 all out, and left Root marooned on an unbeaten 138. Will Jacks probably topped it for the bottle of Moët, however, with the all-rounder swooping round from backward square during Carse’s two-wicket surge, clinging on at full stretch to remove Steve Smith. Having sent down one exploratory and wayward over of off-breaks before the first interval, Jacks at least had something to show for his day in the field. Jofra Archer will doubtless wish that hands had been so adhesive off his bowling, with the drops off Head and Neser meaning figures of one for 74 from 20 overs of work barely told the story of his day. Perhaps the most mystifying aspect of it was a seven-over spell to start the second session, meaning he was gassed out when the tricky twilight period came along. Still, Archer had claimed the wicket of Weatherald lbw and an important one it was too. The opener had been the catalyst for Australia’s initial surge up top, ramping uppercuts and driving the inevitable over-corrections that followed. Comparisons with Eoin Morgan stop at the crouching stance, however, Weatherald having recently called franchise cricket “shit”. Held up against this second day at the Gabba – one that saw huge momentum swings, agony and ecstasy in abundance, and closed with the match still very much in the balance – Weatherald makes a fair point."
sport_2025_dec_05_england-pace-attack-fumble-new-ball-ashes-australia-cricket.txt,sport,2025-12-05,Simon Burnton at the Gabba,Wayward England pace attack fumble their golden chance to strike with new ball,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/05/england-pace-attack-fumble-new-ball-ashes-australia-cricket,"Jofra Archer’s first ball zinged towards Jake Weatherald and screamed just past the bat. His second arrowed into his pads, knocking him off his feet, and after a review the umpire raised his finger. Forty-five overs later, Australia were all out for not many. But that was Perth, a bowling performance that started with a statement of intent from England’s premier fast bowler and a lead followed by his teammates. Archer’s first ball of this Test pitched outside leg stump and flew harmlessly behind Travis Head. His second was more wayward still, again going down leg. His third a wild overcorrection, well wide of off stump. His fourth went back the other way, down the leg side. Again the tone was set, much more discordant this time, and the lead was followed. By the end of the first session of day two here, the main topic of conversation was whether the bowling unit could possibly have fumbled an obviously key period any more clumsily. That kind of behaviour, after all, is normally their batters’ preserve. The pink Kookaburra is not known for being helpful for long, but it is known for being very helpful indeed for the short period when it is fresh and hard and the bowlers fresh and fast. Mitchell Starc had offered a blueprint on day one and in the 13 day-night games he had played in Australia over the past decade. England did not appear to have so much as glanced at it. The plan was right there for them, but instead they went in with none: they peppered the pitch in all the wrong places, bowling too wide and then too straight, too short and then too full. It was miserable to watch and easy to face: much of the time the only thing that could possibly have been feeling less threatened than the two batters was the top of off stump. Australia’s innings, it is true, started with three maidens, but then Gus Atkinson bowled short and wide to Weatherald, who leaned back to nudge the ball down to the third man boundary – the first of an infuriating number of similar gifts, a flood of easy runs off the back foot – and they were away. Another boundary followed later in the over; in the next Archer got his line wrong again, the ball flicking Head’s buttock and running away for four leg byes. From no runs after three overs they went at 7.1 an over until drinks, which gave England a sorely needed few minutes to regroup, an opportunity to huddle and chat, for someone to say a few telling, motivating words. The players’ body language here was fascinating: Ben Stokes spoke quietly to Brydon Carse, whose first over had just bled 14 runs, and everyone else just stood around. They had by then been toiling for an hour in the Brisbane heat, mounting misery interrupted only by the moment when Archer – by a distance the least bad of England’s bowlers – happened upon the right line, found the edge of Head’s bat and Jamie Smith flubbed a straightforward catch behind the stumps. It was as close as they had come to encouragement and its effect was instead demoralising. The only thing the bowlers successfully achieved thereafter was identifying a method of guaranteeing it was not repeated. Head was struggling a little at the time of the drop and scored four off his first 29 balls. And then 29 off his next 14. Between drinks and tea the run rate dropped only marginally, to 6.8, even though Head miscued another of Carse’s invitations to score and Atkinson backpedalled to take the catch at mid-on. As this was happening, the words of Zak Crawley the previous night floated irrepressibly to mind. “I think it’s a good score,” he had said of England’s overnight total of 325, to which they would add another nine, “and the fact that we might score a bit quicker and get more runs in the day than Australia might play in our favour.” Well, yes, about that. It turned out it wasn’t just dinner Crawley was eating at the end of Friday’s first session, at which point Australia had ransacked 125 off their previous 18 overs and the tone for the day had been set. There was one period when they scored 91, with 16 boundaries, in the space of 11 overs, most of those bowled by Carse, whose inconsistency of line and length was at times bewildering, and Stokes – the pair who would briefly hint at rescuing the situation towards the end of the day. Crawley’s comment, and indeed the England total, may have felt reasonable at the time, but it seemed a bit less impressive a couple of playing hours later when only going off for tea halted Australia’s teeing off."

Travis Head, Alex Carey – twice – Josh Inglis and Michael Neser all got lifelines as Australia ended day two of the second Test on 378 for six, a lead of 44. “We worked as hard as we could in the lead-up to this, we had five days of prep and we did a huge amount of catching,” Root said. “We made sure we utilised those two [training] sessions under lights well. You can’t replicate that surface, the bounce, the way the nicks come. It’s never going to be exactly the same, it’s never going to be perfect. All you can do is give yourself the best possible chance and I think we’ve done that. “In the lead-up to this game we’ve got used to conditions, we’ve got used to the heat, we’ve got used to the surfaces. We’ve caught under lights, we’ve caught in daylight and tried to catch in twilight as well. Sometimes they don’t stick. We’re not perfect, we’re all human and we’re going to make mistakes. It’s how we respond. It’s about making sure we turn up tomorrow with the right frame of mind, the right attitude, and knowing our best game of cricket is good enough to do very special things here.” Jake Weatherald, whose 72 was his first Test half-century for Australia, sympathised with England’s fielders, describing seeing the pink ball at the Gabba as “another level hard”. “We were lucky we didn’t get as many catches square of the wicket as them,” he said. “It is really difficult. It was hard [in Perth] last week with the red ball against the crowds. This week has been another level hard, especially square of the wicket. I feel for them, I understand how hard it is out there, especially when the ball is being hit hard and there is a bit of dew on the wicket as well. It comes flying at you and it’s not great visuals.” Root described England’s position as “not massively out of the game at all … actually not too far behind as long as we get things right early tomorrow”. That this is the case has a lot to do with Root ending England’s innings unbeaten on 138, finally securing his first Test century in Australia. “I’ve said a few times, this tour is not about me, it’s not about me scoring a hundred in Australia,” he said. “My job is to score as many runs as I can. As a senior batter I expect that of myself and I’ll go out there with the same attitude every single time.”"

The paddock positively hums with a febrile, pulsing excitement and sense of expectation that is impossible to ignore. Amid all of which the title favourite, Lando Norris, finds himself at the moment he has dedicated his life toward, destiny lying in his own hands. After a gruelling 23-race trek around the world, the conclusion of all the work, sacrifice and effort will be decided in just an hour and a half on Sunday afternoon in Abu Dhabi. Norris has been fascinating to observe across a season during which he opened on top, was then eclipsed by his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri before mounting a comeback in the final third to retake the lead. Entering the final rubber at the Yas Marina Circuit, he holds a 12-point advantage over Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and 16 over Piastri. Back in April at Suzuka, Norris was as forthright and honest as ever when we discussed his title hopes. At the time a potential championship decider was a world away but he was already adamant about how he would like to win it. “I feel like there is a very prescribed version of how people say a world champion needs to be – overly aggressive,” he said. “I’ll do whatever I can to win a championship but maybe I won’t sacrifice in my life as much as some others, in terms of who I am as a person and have the ‘fuck you’ mentality people say you’ve got to have. I still believe I can be a world champion but doing it by being a nice guy. “I want to just enjoy my life. That’s kind of the attitude that’s maybe not as much of a killer instinct. I just don’t think you have to have that to be a world champion. I want to prove you can be a world champion and not have it. I’ll still take risks and I’ll still do whatever I know I can do to be a world champion but without losing the liberty of who I am.” This weekend will present the acid test of how Norris copes with maintaining that sense of self. Thus far, true to his word, he has played a straight bat. The British driver has got his elbows out on occasion as he did against Piastri in Singapore but has kept a good relationship with his teammate as the title race has fluctuated between them and as Verstappen charged back into the reckoning. It was instructive that as he composed himself preparing for the decisive race, Norris still had that sense of perspective. “If it doesn’t go my way, then I try again next year,” he said. “It’ll hurt probably for a little while but then that’s life. I’ll crack on and try and do better next season. “I also feel like I have the mentality of ‘I have nothing to lose’ because it’s just a race for a championship. In 30 years’ time, I probably won’t think of it that much either way. So, I’m not too bothered.” Such nihilist analysis is surely a mechanism to allow him to focus simply on the job at hand, rather than the import which hangs so heavy over it. Of the many permutations of what might happen on Sunday, if Norris does not seal it the criticism he is most likely to receive is that he is not ruthless enough and that he may well have been beaten by Verstappen who has no such qualms. Indeed, the most ominous sign going into the weekend was how entirely relaxed the defending world champion was. Observing him laughing and joking about the task ahead and his repeated observations that he had nothing to lose, must have given Norris and the outsider Piastri pause for thought. Verstappen has closed out four consecutive drivers’ championships. His nerves are certainly not jangling, he feels no pressure. He noted in Abu Dhabi that his parents were not attending as he had no expectation to be in the title fight at the finale. “I have four of those [trophies] at home, so it’s nice to add a fifth,” he said to laughter when asked about his ambition going into the race. “I’ve already achieved everything that I wanted to achieve in F1 and everything is just a bonus. I just keep doing it because I love it and I enjoy it. That’s also how I go into this weekend, have a good time out there, try to maximise the result.” His ease will doubtless be in stark contrast to the intense pressure Norris and Piastri currently feel. The first title is always the hardest and any error in this race might make the difference. Verstappen was so nervous on the final laps of his controversial first championship win here in Abu Dhabi in 2021 that his calf muscles began cramping. The mathematics of this decider have many permutations but put simply, Norris will win if he finishes in front of both his rivals or claims third place or better. Verstappen would need to win and hope Norris finishes outside the podium places while Piastri would need to win and have the Briton finish sixth or lower. Other factors might yet also be in play but will not become clearer until after qualifying. In terms of performance the track in Abu Dhabi is finely balanced between McLaren and Red Bull, with both enjoying sectors that will suit their car. Equally, Mercedes and Ferrari will expect to be strong at least in fighting to be the third and fourth fastest cars and drivers from both teams might project themselves into the title fight. All four of whom drivers will pursue their goal of finishing as well as possible with no thought for how it affects the protagonists around them. On recent form George Russell and Charles Leclerc might expect to be in the mix, especially if there is an upset in qualifying. Neither will yield a place easily. However, one advantage McLaren does enjoy is that both their drivers will be in said mix. Verstappen’s teammate Yuki Tsunoda is highly unlikely to play any part in the Dutchman’s charge given how far off the pace he has been this season . Indeed, unless Norris or Piastri suffers a cataclysm in qualifying the three protagonists will probably be duking it out at the front for the championship on Sunday and that is what everyone wants to see. The moment of destiny in the desert."
sport_2025_dec_05_mclaren-to-use-team-orders-in-quest-for-drivers-title-in-abu-dhabi.txt,sport,2025-12-05,"Giles Richards at Yas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi",McLaren will use team orders in quest for F1 world drivers’ title in Abu Dhabi,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/05/mclaren-to-use-team-orders-in-quest-for-drivers-title-in-abu-dhabi,"Zak Brown has said McLaren will use team orders for Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri if required to ensure the team secure the Formula One drivers’ championship in the season finale at Abu Dhabi on Sunday. With Red Bull’s Max Verstappen trailing Norris by 12 points, the Dutchman still has a shot at taking the title from McLaren’s grasp. Piastri is a further four points back. Having spent all season allowing their drivers to race and attempting to be scrupulously fair to both, Brown announced at the Yas Marina circuit that if circumstances rendered it necessary, they would use orders. “Yes, of course. We’re realistic, we want to win this drivers’ championship,” the McLaren chief executive said. “If we get into the race and it’s becoming pretty clear that one has a chance and the other doesn’t, we’re going to do what we can to win. It would be crazy not to.” With Norris requiring third place or better to seal his first championship, the most likely scenario involving team orders would require Piastri to give up a place to Norris to guarantee him a podium spot in the event of Verstappen leading the race. Brown said he was confident both drivers would acquiesce to any instruction from the team, when asked if he believed Piastri would willingly move over for Norris. “Yes, our drivers have always complied with team wishes just as we comply with their wishes,” he said. “So I’ve got no doubt either of our drivers will continue to race, as they’ve done brilliantly, in the best interests of the team.” On Thursday in Abu Dhabi Norris and Piastri said they had yet to have any discussion about orders with the team but the team principal, Andrea Stella, had been clear after the last round in Qatar that they would address the issue and come to clear, agreed plans with their drivers. McLaren’s approach to being fair to both drivers has come under considerable scrutiny this season but Brown denied the team were going back on their principles. “I don’t think it’s a U-turn,” he said. “We’re going to start the weekend like we have the other 23, which is going in giving both drivers equal opportunity. We’ll use common sense. We’re not going to throw away a drivers’ championship over a sixth and a seventh place, a third and a fourth place, a fifth and a sixth place, if one of our drivers doesn’t have the opportunity. We’re just going to stay true to our racing principles. So we’ll see how the race plays out.” Norris remains favourite but Verstappen goes into the finale with four consecutive drivers’ championship titles under his belt and has recovered from a 104‑point deficit at the Dutch GP in late August. His team principal, Laurent Mekies, paid tribute to him and the team’s achievements. “Max just never does a mistake,” he said. “He keeps surprising us every day. You throw him out there. Sometimes, the car is great. Sometimes it’s a touch less great than what we would hope and he doesn’t miss a start. He doesn’t miss tyre management, he doesn’t miss an overtake. “He’s just the way he is. It is true that it gives a lot of confidence to the whole team. It is true that it fits so well with, in general, the approach that this team has on how you go racing, taking maximum risk, accepting the pain when the risk went over the edge.” Norris topped the time sheets in first practice in Abu Dhabi but by only eight-thousandths of a second. Piastri did not run in the first session, as he had to take his mandatory second time sitting out practice to allow a young driver a chance in the car. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was third, only a hundredth of a second off Verstappen. Norris was once more on top in the second session, appearing confident and dialled in at the Yas Marina circuit. He was three-tenths up on Verstappen in second with Mercedes’ George Russell third and Piastri only in 11th, apparently suffering from balance issues"

The English players suffered for most of the event, but hit back in style on Thursday when all four won their eighth-round games. Scores after eight of the nine rounds were Nodirbek Abdusattorov (Uzbekistan) 7, Alireza Firouzja (France) 5, Nikita Vitiugov (England) 4.5, Luke McShane and Michael Adams (both England) 4, Nikolas Theodorou (Greece) and Pavel Eljanov (Ukraine) 3.5, Abhimanyu Mishra (USA) and Gawain Maroroa Jones (England) 3, Sam Shankland (USA) 2.5. The four English victories in Thursday night’s eighth round transformed what had been a difficult event into a demonstration of sustained national strength at the board. Round nine can be watched free and live on Friday (4pm GMT start) with computer commentary on lichess.org or with grandmaster commentary on chess.com. Abdusattorov, 21, demonstrated his skills with a dominant 3000+ tournament rating performance and a feat of memory in a key game. Paired as White in round two with Mishra, the 16-year-old who at 12 set a world record as the youngest ever grandmaster, Abdusattorov faced the rare Arkhangelsk Ruy Lopez, where Black meets 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 by a6, b5, Bb7 and Bc5. The Uzbek GM was fully prepared for it, and for the first 34(!) moves needed only to double-check his analysis while his opponent used his full time allowance. After the game, Abdusattorov showed that Black could have equalised by 20….Re6! instead of 20…h4?, that his 30 Ke3! improved on a previous 2025 game won by Russia’s Alexander Grischuk, and that 34 Ke3! the final move of his deep preparation, was the only way to get a winning position. White’s g and h pawns are decisive, although it still took another 15 moves to get the pair united on the seventh rank and to force Black’s resignation. Abdusattorov summed up: “It’s very easy to misjudge this endgame from a human perspective. That’s how we tend to think as humans, but the engine is merciless.” By round five, when the former tennis star Andy Murray made a ceremonial opening move for him, Abdusattorov’s lead over his main rival Firouzja had already stretched to a full point. The Frenchman, who Magnus Carlsen had predicted back in 2022 to be his successor as world champion, lacked sharpness and conceded several draws to opponents in the lower half of the table. Abdusattorov’s fifth successive win, against Shankland in round six, raised his tournament performance rating to 3050 and was a crushing attack where the American resigned one move before checkmate. When the two leaders met in Thursday’s night’s eighth round, Firouzja chose a rare variation of the Queen’s Gambit Accepted with 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 e4, but got nothing from the opening. Abdusattorov could even have played on at the end with 31….Qg6, but chose to draw by perpetual check to wrap up his tournament victory. The event’s Fide Open included world No 7 Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu, who needed to complete a tournament with 50+ competitors to qualify for next year’s Candidates. He made heavy weather of it, including a round six draw with Velimir Ilic, who accepted a peace offer in a position where 25 Rxe6 Qxe6 26 Qe3! would have given the Serb excellent winning chances. At the end, Praggnanandhaa and Ilic both scored 7.5/9 and shared the £10,000 first prize with GM Ameet Ghasi. The 38-year-old Englishman, who works full-time for Biogen and only achieved his grandmaster title a year ago, scored the best result of his career, a remarkable performance by an amateur who took an eight-year break from chess in his late teens. Ghasi’s decisive final round win against Dan Fernandez was out of the ordinary, too. Fernandez, who ended a point behind the winners but along with Matthew Wadsworth (6.5/9) achieved an elite tournament performance above 2600, went for broke with an early g4-g5 against the ancient Philidor Defence 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 d6. Ghasi responded forcefully, and the critical moment came at move 15 where the unlikely 15 Nd1! would have kept White in the game while 15 Qg3? as played soon led to decisive material loss. Many English junior talents took part in the Fide Open, but none were consistent enough to score GM or IM norms. However, Supratit Banerjee, 11, and Kai Hanache, 13, both maintained their very promising progress with strong tournament rating performances. One of the highlights was a 19-move miniature by IM Jonah Willow, where his 19 Nb5! induced immediate resignation. 4001 1 Rh4+! gxh4 2 Nh6+! Rxh6 3 h3 mate."
sport_2025_dec_05_sale-concede-26-unanswered-points-to-slump-to-home-loss-to-glasgow-in-euro-opener.txt,sport,2025-12-05,Ross Heppenstall at CorpAcq Stadium,Sale blow 14-0 lead to slump to home defeat by Glasgow in Champions Cup opener,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/05/sale-concede-26-unanswered-points-to-slump-to-home-loss-to-glasgow-in-euro-opener,"Losing is in danger of becoming a habit for Sale after a stellar Glasgow side headed back north with a bonus-point win in this Champions Cup opener. Alex Sanderson’s hosts, beaten here by Exeter a week ago and already off the pace in their Prem campaign, let slip an early 14-0 lead to a Warriors team packed with some of Scotland’s finest talent. Franco Smith’s men, inspired by the captain, Kyle Steyn, and centre pairing Stafford McDowall and Sione Tuipulotu, showed their mettle to beat Sale in this competition for the second season running. Several of Sale’s England internationals – George Ford, Tom Roebuck, Bevan Rodd, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Carpenter and Asher Opoku-Fordjour – were unavailable. But defeats on their home turf on the outskirts of Salford have been a rarity in recent seasons under Sanderson; now they have suffered two inside a week. The Sale director of rugby, whose side lost 27-26 at home to Exeter after leading 26-6, said: “I’m not concerned – I’ve been on longer runs of losses in 20 years of coaching. “I understand that at times it gets hard, but that’s the way sport goes and it’s about finding a way to work your way out of it. Weirdly, some part of me enjoys that aspect of the job. You have to otherwise you’ll spend 30-40% of your life in abject misery.” Smith, Glasgow’s head coach, could not hide his delight after another notable victory over Sale, who they thumped 38-19 at Scotstoun last December. The South African said: “Sale were on a revenge path after last year, but I’ve got a lot of confidence and trust in my boys. We often fight back, but to score 26 points after you’ve been down 14 was important. Now it’s on to the next challenge.” It was a bitterly cold, windswept evening, the kind that can test the soul, but Sale quickly warmed to their task. With the wind at their backs, they led when their captain, Ernst van Rhyn, outmuscled the visiting defence to squeeze over from close range and Rob du Preez converted. Sale lost the centre Rekeiti Ma’asi-White to injury in the 16th minute but his replacement Ollie Davies, 19, scored on his Champions Cup debut soon after following excellent work from the full-back Arron Reed. Du Preez’s second conversion put Sale 14-0 ahead but Glasgow steadied themselves and began to go through the phases in home territory. Their pressure finally told in the 32nd minute when the hooker Gregor Hiddleston was driven over in the left corner. Moments before the interval, the Scotland flanker Rory Darge dived over from close range and Adam Hastings’s conversion cut Sale’s lead to two points. The way Glasgow ended the first half poured confidence into Smith’s players and they seized the initiative to edge in front just two minutes after the interval. A poor box kick from Sale’s scrum-half, Raffi Quirke, was seized on by Steyn and he showed impressive speed and strength to break away, outpace a leaden-footed home defence and score. It was awful defending and Hastings added the conversion to put Glasgow 21-14 in front before his side grabbed a fourth try in the 54th minute. This time the impressive McDowall capitalised on more dreadful defending to canter over from close range on his 100th appearance for the Warriors, who had now scored 26 points without reply. In the 64th minute, Marius Louw scored Sale’s third try after good work by Tom O’Flaherty. Du Preez converted to cut Glasgow’s advantage to five points. Could Sanderson’s men, with Ben Curry having been introduced, rouse themselves once again to find a match-winning score? The answer was no as Sale were left with a now familiar sinking feeling. Sanderson, a positive person by nature, said: “We lost by a point last week and five points tonight, so it’s not a big step to start turning things around and getting wins. I’m encouraged by that, but there are some things we can do better.”"
sport_2025_dec_05_saracens-hatch-plan-to-put-dent-in-french-dominance-against-clermont.txt,sport,2025-12-05,Luke McLaughlin,Saracens hatch plan to put dent in French dominance against Clermont,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/05/saracens-hatch-plan-to-put-dent-in-french-dominance-against-clermont,"Judging by the Saracens side starting their Champions Cup campaign against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday, a show of strength is the aim. Owen Farrell, Elliot Daly, Tom Willis and Nick Isiekwe are some of the distinguished names who will line up in north London aiming to put a small, symbolic dent in the notion that French clubs are poised to dominate the competition again. Even without the rested England captain, Maro Itoje, and back-row Ben Earl – both recently returned from a successful autumn campaign – the quality of the lineup indicates the depth required for a deep tournament run. Noah Caluori, the 19-year-old who shot to prominence in October and was rewarded with an England call-up, makes his European debut: the presence of the 6ft 4in wing, allied to Farrell’s kicking prowess, will be causing some stress among Clermont’s coaching team. Saracens last lifted the trophy in 2019, when they beat Leinster in the final, and Caluori had yet to enter his teens. Exeter triumphed the following year, but since then French clubs and the Dublin-based province have dominated, at least based on final appearances if not silverware in Leinster’s case. For Saracens, 2020 brought the conclusion of the salary-cap scandal that resulted in them being demoted to the Championship: the cap that significantly hampers Prem sides aiming to fight on two fronts, domestically and in Europe. A further hazard for clubs producing Test players is losing them to international duty, injuries sustained while away and the obligation to rest them at inconvenient times. Jamie George is a case in point. The veteran hooker is recovering from a hamstring injury sustained in England’s win against the All Blacks last month, but there is no better qualified spokesperson. George began this year by reaching 300 Saracens appearances and brought up a century of England caps, against Italy, in the Six Nations soon after. While he is not exactly downbeat on Saracens’ prospects, his assessment is an exercise in managing expectations. “It’s very challenging,” he said of the Prem teams’ task to compete domestically and in Europe. “What Bath did last year [winning the European Challenge Cup and the Premiership] was very impressive, so they have proven it’s possible. They have really great strength in depth.” Bath’s double was a fine accomplishment, but George knows preventing the most coveted European trophy again falling into French hands will be a different matter. “There’s got to be a little bit of luck on our side in terms of keeping people fit and generating a little bit of momentum going into the competition,” he said. “French rugby’s in a brilliant spot.” Clermont, who Saracens defeated at Murrayfield in the 2017 final, have problems of their own. They listed 14 players as unavailable due to injury, Alivereti Raka the most notable among them. Régis Montagne of France and Marcos Kremer of Argentina are unavailable due to the recent international window. Added to salary-cap restrictions for English clubs is a recent factor that is theoretically the same for all: playing in South Africa. The forecast is 11C for the Clermont encounter and 30C in Durban a week later, when Saracens face the Sharks. “When you weigh up the travel, the weather, the conditions, being away from home for a week … it’s challenging,” George said. “At the same time it’s an exciting opportunity for us to go out to South Africa. We didn’t do so well last time we went out there, in Pretoria. We had a pre-season trip to Durban, we checked out the sights, so we know what to expect.” When George passed the 300-cap mark for his club in January, Saracens’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, said his longevity is due to “competitive spirit and drive … but he’s able to combine that with being a really good bloke.” Similarly it tells you a lot about George’s personality that Steve Borthwick, the England head coach, asked him to stay with the squad at Pennyhill Park in a leadership capacity after his injury. “That was really cool for me to do,” George said. ”I’d loved the previous three weeks and felt like I could still add, even if I wasn’t necessarily on the field.” Asked for his favourite European wins aside from the obvious finals, George said. “The Toulon game in 2016. That was an amazing win. They’re the ones you remember for a very long time. It was a full-circle moment, one of the times we realised we were in the place we needed to be in order to be successful.” After kicking things off against Clermont Auvergne, Saracens will know a little more about the place they in are now."
sport_2025_dec_05_steve-smith-on-top-again-ashes-rivalry-jofra-archer-cricket.txt,sport,2025-12-05,Geoff Lemon at the Gabba,Steve Smith on top again after he resumes Ashes hostilities with Jofra Archer,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/05/steve-smith-on-top-again-ashes-rivalry-jofra-archer-cricket,"Jofra Archer versus Steve Smith in 2019 is already Ashes folklore. The atmosphere at Lord’s that afternoon was charged in all senses, a huge slab of cloud bringing darkness to the day. Fresh from a match-winning World Cup final, Archer marked his Test debut with what was then the fastest spell recorded for England. Smith was in the middle of a Bradman-hued streak of 774 runs in seven innings. All that could pause him was a short-pitched attack of building ferocity, one that finally dropped Smith with a bouncer to the neck. It was a pure duel, the kind that cause spectators genuine fear. In the immediate aftermath, and again as Archer took six-fers in wins at Headingley and the Oval, one principal idea came up: imagine, what would he be able to do in Australia? Imagine him on a fast and bouncy track in Perth or Brisbane. It was: “I can’t wait to get you to the Gabba”, but born of admiration rather than antagonism. The show, we all imagined, could be a spectacle. It took six and a half years, but Archer got to Perth a fortnight ago. His opening burst lived up to expectation, removing both openers for 11 runs, before being ambushed in the second innings like the rest of his team. Now in Brisbane, here he was again: tricky conditions, a night session, pink ball, floodlights – and Smith in his sights. As long as Smith keeps playing, he remains the centre of Ashes contests, even more for opposing supporters than his own. As he walked out here on the second afternoon, the English in the stands rose to jeer him. Australians rose in response to urge him on. Support drowned out disparagement. Loved or loathed, when Smith bats, eyes focus on the game. When Smith faces Archer, people really sit up and pay attention. Smith would deny this is the central contest. With a degree of saltiness from a man whose flavour profile is more dry white toast than four fried chickens and a Coke, he has repeated the point over the years that Archer never took his wicket at Lord’s. Knocked out, not got out, and Smith will not concede that as a defeat. For anyone engineering a Mandela effect in which that concussion prompted his batting decline over the following years, remember that his first knock after the knockout was a double ton. Archer played in that game too. He is in his fifth Test against Smith and has still never got him out, a personal worst for the bowler. But still, stats and energy are often divergent and the energy says that Archer to Smith is box office. So does Archer’s inclination. Having just dismissed Jake Weatherald, his first ball to Smith on Friday was in daylight, in the second session, and the bouncer pinged down at 146km (90.7mph) – an absurd figure given the speed gun tends to clock short balls as slower. Smith got out of the way. Stuck with a difficult decision, Ben Stokes kept Archer going to break the batting-axis partnership. But as Marnus Labuschagne soaked up much of it, the seven-over spell came at a cost. With Archer having started after the first break at 4.40pm, he bowled through the heat of daylight and was cooked by the onset of dusk. Through the same period the previous day, Australia had conceded an hour of England having a sense of control, in exchange for holding back the left-arm menace Mitchell Starc. Unleashed half an hour before sunset, at 6.02pm, he began a dusk demolition with some help from Harry Brook. In the same conducive conditions a day later, England’s main weapon had an empty tank. By the time Archer could return it was after the second break, under dark skies, with his bowling speeds in the 130s rather than scaling the 140s. He still gave it his best shot, smacking Smith on the gloves, testing him with short balls, but the batter kept finding a response, edging a hook for four, uppercutting a bouncer for six, steering away through gully to the rope again. For all of his efforts, Archer could not get through and he must have felt a contradictory relief and resentment to see Smith’s wicket given away to the battered Brydon Carse. Since that day back in 2019, the duel has been better in the imagination. Smith’s two blackened eyes in this Test have been of his own choosing. The glare has not unsettled him and he has continued taking on the contest. On Friday, Archer danced, Archer swung, Archer bruised the other guy’s knuckles, but Archer never landed a telling blow of his own."

The day-nighter at the Gabba has already thrown up more storylines than an entire season of Neighbours, and our team of writers – Ali Martin, Geoff Lemon and Simon Burnton – are in Brisbane for reports, news and analysis. Australian supporters are welcome to join the conversation, too. 8am-12pm Matchday live Football Emillia Hawkins and John Brewin take the controls for our essential weekly gateway to the day’s football action. There’ll be plenty of washup from Friday’s World Cup draw in Washington DC as well as team news, breaking stories and snippets from our reporters around the grounds. Our World Cup reporter Paul MacInnes will be on hand for a Q&amp;A from 11am, so email your questions to matchday.live@theguardian.com to take part. 12pm Arsenal v Liverpool live Women’s Super League The WSL returns after the international break for one of the division’s established fixtures. Only Arsenal v Chelsea at 30 meetings surpasses the Gunners’ head to head with Liverpool – the clubs having faced each other over 25 matches in the WSL. At the Emirates for No 26, there will be plenty of expectation circling the visitors’ Beata Olsson. The striker has scored in each of her last three league starts for the Reds – find the net on Saturday, and the 24-year-old Swede will become the first WSL player to score in four of her first five starts in the competition. Emillia Hawkins helms our live blog, with Suzanne Wrack reporting from the Emirates Stadium. 12.30pm Aston Villa v Arsenal live Premier League Aston Villa’s 4-3 come-from-behind victory at Brighton in midweek continued their impressive run of form and earned them a 12th win from their last 14 in all competitions. A fourth straight win pushed them up to third in the table. As a bonus, Ollie Watkins scored his first Premier League goals since September and it is the second time Villa have come back to win in their last three in the league. The visitors have a five-point cushion over second-placed Manchester City after Mikel Arteta’s side rolled over Brentford 2-0 on Wednesday night. Villa, though, have a history of spoiling the Gunners’ title ambitions. Their 2023-24 title bid went south after a 2-0 Villa victory in mid-April 2024 helped Manchester City over the line, then a 2-2 draw at the Emirates last January sidelined Arsenal’s championship pursuit as Liverpool ran away with the laurels. Barry Glendenning is on live blog duty, with Peter Lansley reporting from Villa Park. 2pm Abu Dhabi Grand Prix qualifying live Formula One Formula One will crown its champion in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, with McLaren’s Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri seeking to dethrone Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and deny the Dutchman his fifth title in a row. Norris is favourite in the three-way showdown, 12 points clear of Verstappen but needing to finish on the podium at Yas Marina. All have seven wins each, all are capable of adding to that tally and ready to deliver an edge-of-the-seat sunset finale. So the drama of the contest for pole is ramped up on a circuit where last season Norris started from No 1 on the grid and went all the way to the chequered flag. Philip Cornwall is our live blog host, with Giles Richards reporting from Yas Marina. 3pm Clockwatch Premier League Thomas Frank faces his former club Brentford with a battling point at Newcastle on Tuesday ending a worrying run of three consecutive defeats, which had sparked questions about his long-term prospects at Tottenham. Spurs’ home form in the Premier League in 2025 has been troubling and, while a large chunk was under Frank’s predecessor Ange Postecoglou, the Dane has overseen four defeats in his seven league fixtures in N17. Overall Tottenham have won only three of their last 21 home league matches, though Brentford have lost six times on the road this season in the division. Jacob Steinberg reports. Elsewhere, Manchester City may sit second before the weekend’s fixtures but they will be taking Sunderland seriously. Régis Le Bris’s side have already beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and earned draws with Arsenal and Liverpool. They have swagged 23 points from 14 games so far – only five fewer than City – and are in with a shout at the Etihad, where Jamie Jackson is our reporter. John Brewin will guide you through all the news and action from around the grounds on a busy afternoon in the Premier League. 5.30pm Leeds v Liverpool live Premier League Leeds produced an impressive display to beat Chelsea 3-1 at Elland Road on Wednesday to climb out of the relegation zone, with Jaka Bijol, Ao Tanaka and Dominic Calvert-Lewin on the scoresheet. The Yorkshire side’s attention now turns to a home clash against Liverpool and Daniel Farke has some late fitness concerns over Lukas Nmecha (hamstring) and Calvert-Lewin (calf). Liverpool dropped more points in Wednesday’s 1-1 home draw with Sunderland but Arne Slot remains positive about his faltering champions’ prospects after last Sunday’s 2-0 win at West Ham ended a run of three straight defeats. “Four points out of two games is different from the last two home games we’ve played, in which we lost both and conceded seven goals,” Slot said. “In the last two games, we were one deflection away from keeping two clean sheets. That’s a step forward if you compare it with seven goals conceded in two games. We did not concede from a set piece, which is also important, and we got two results. There are positives to take, but of course we are still not where we want to be. Let that be obvious and clear.” Scott Murray helms our coverage of the buildup and the match itself, while Jonathan Wilson reports from Elland Road. 7.30pm Inter Miami v Vancouver Whitecaps live MLS Cup final It would be easy to bill the MLS Cup final as a clash of two formidable footballers but Thomas Müller is not having it. “It’s not about Messi against Thomas Müller, it’s Miami against the Whitecaps,” the 36-year-old former Bayern Munich and Germany striker told the MLS website. “Maybe they rely a little bit more on him than we do on me, because we are such a good group. The nice thing about it is not only playing against the greatest player who played our game and is still playing our game, it’s more that when you have a pairing like this, more people are watching.” With two clubs making their first appearance in the final, the contest for the Philip F Anschutz Trophy should throw up plenty of storylines, not least with Javier Mascherano’s pink ’uns featuring such luminaries as Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Luis Suárez. Bryan Armen Graham has all the action minute by minute from the Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale. Sunday 4am Australia v England live Second Ashes Test Geoff Lemon and James Wallace pick up the Ashes baton on over-by-over duty for day four of the day-nighter at the Gabba. And if you have a spare moment, during a drinks break perhaps, or one of Marnus Labuschagne’s longueurs at the crease, why not take a look at our tremendous 100 greatest men’s Ashes cricketers of all time? 8am-1pm Matchday live Football Dominic Booth, Daniel Harris and Rob Smyth clock on to keep you abreast of all Sunday’s football action, with two games in the Premier League – Brighton v West Ham and Fulham v Crystal Palace – plus a top-two clash in Scotland. Wilfried Nancy arrives at Celtic from the MLS and the Frenchman kicks off his reign against the Premiership leaders, Hearts, with our reporter Ewan Murray covering the game. They’ll be keeping an eye too on the FA Cup second round, particularly on Slough Town as they face Macclesfield. The non-league club’s manager, Scott Davies, has a compelling backstory and plenty to say to Billy Munday, in this fascinating interview. 12pm Clockwatch Women’s Super League Dominic Booth returns from noon to cover the news, reaction and analysis from Sunday’s WSL fixture list, which features Leicester v Manchester City, London City v Brighton, Tottenham v Aston Villa, Manchester United v West Ham and Chelsea v Everton. The champions’ performance of late is the cause of some alarm after dropped points in back-to-back games in the WSL and being held by Barcelona in Europe. After Chelsea’s 1-1 draw with Liverpool, Sonia Bompastor did not hold back. “That’s not the performance we wanted to put on the pitch. The performance was not good enough,” the Chelsea manager said. “We were not clinical enough.” A lack of goals has been a problem, not helped by Aggie Beever-Jones struggling for form. The forward is without a goal in her last seven games after a run of goals in four consecutive games to start the season. 1pm Abu Dhabi Grand Prix live Formula One While the title drama plays out in a thrilling three-way tussle (see above), others on the grid will be chasing prize money and points to improve their place in the paddock pecking order. Mercedes and Red Bull are fighting for second place, although the former look likely to prevail with George Russell and Kimi Antonelli given the latter team’s reliance on Verstappen. The race will be a final outing for Japan’s Yuki Tsunoda at Red Bull, his seat handed to Isack Hadjar for next season, and for Honda as their engine partners before switching to Aston Martin. Ferrari have one last chance to win a race in 2025 while Lewis Hamilton is facing the bleak prospect of a first season without a podium finish. Sauber, in their last race before becoming Audi and with Nico Hülkenberg making his 250th start, are only five points behind eighth-placed Haas. who are in turn seven adrift of Aston Martin. Renault-owned Alpine are competing for the last time with Renault engines before a switch to Mercedes power. For Franco Colapinto, that means one last attempt to score his first point of the campaign. Niall McVeigh helms our live coverage, as Giles Richards reports. 2pm Brighton v West Ham live Premier League The Hammers, disconsolate in the relegation zone, bagged a creditable draw at Old Trafford on Thursday evening as Soungoutou Magassa claimed a maiden Premier League goal in the 83rd-minute of the 1-1 draw that so frustrated Manchester United. Brighton will want to move on from their midweek defeat against Aston Villa, a 4-3 thriller that saw the visitors claw back a two-goal deficit. That meant Brighton slipped to seventh after a 10-match unbeaten home run – stretching back to a 3-0 loss to Villa in early April – was ended. Daniel Harris is on minute-by-minute duty and John Brewin reports from the Amex. 4.30pm Fulham v Crystal Palace live Premier League Fulham were unfortunate not to recover a point in their madcap 5-4 home defeat against Manchester City on Tuesday. Marco Silva’s defiant Thames-siders were trailing shortly after half-time only to thunder back with three goals of their own and spend the final 15 minutes rocking the City edifice in search of a late equaliser. Still, it was just a second defeat at Craven Cottage this season for the home side, with Arsenal the only other team to leave west London with three points. Crystal Palace, meanwhile, held out for a 1-0 win at Burnley on Wednesday night and, as they juggle a demanding schedule, that leaves tired legs with less recovery time than Sunday’s rivals. The win for Oliver Glasner’s side came after last Thursday’s 2-1 Conference League loss in Strasbourg and Sunday’s 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United. Rob Smyth keeps a keenly observed live blog ticking over while Ed Aarons reports from the west London ground. 6pm NFL clockwatch: Steelers v Ravens, Bengals v Bills American football Graham Searles returns for expert coverage of week 14 in the NFL. Last time out, Pittsburgh Steelers fell to 6-5 as today’s opponents, the Baltimore Ravens, moved to the top of the AFC North with a 23-10 win over the New York Jets, with Derrick Henry rushing for two third-quarter touchdowns. It’s something of a must-win derby for Pittsburgh – almost an early playoff game – with the AFC North crown on the line. Our other featured game pits the Bengals – beaten 26-20 by the AFC East top dogs, the Patriots, in week 13 – against the Bills, with Buffalo boasting a 5-1 home record this season and fresh from beating the Steelers 26-7 on the road."
sport_2025_nov_28_needless-mystery-from-australia-over-cummins-and-khawaja-for-second-test.txt,sport,2025-11-28,Geoff Lemon,Why the needless mystery from Australia over Cummins and Khawaja for second Test?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/28/needless-mystery-from-australia-over-cummins-and-khawaja-for-second-test,"You could speculate about whether Cricket Australia deliberately prefers to be opaque regarding player availability and team plans, or whether it just has a deficiency in communications, but once again the fitness of players and the makeup of the XI is left to be inferred from the selection in the larger squad of 14 players for the second Ashes Test in Brisbane. Normally, a board naming an unchanged squad would not be much news. This time it is, thanks to the possible movement in either direction of Pat Cummins and Usman Khawaja, neither of which has now eventuated. Cummins is the surprise for not being included, with the regular captain and fast-bowling leader deep into his recovery from the early signs of a stress fracture in his back. The only public acknowledgment of the situation was a cursory line with the squad release saying that “Pat Cummins will travel to Brisbane to continue his preparations”. Suggestions from within CA support the view that this is all situation normal and that his recovery remains happily on track, as a likely addition to the team in the near future. In theory Cummins could even join the Brisbane squad in coming days if he and management so choose. But still, something the claims doesn’t add up. Going back to when Cummins’ scans were cleared in October, starting the clock on his buildup to match fitness, all public commentary from the bowler himself as well as timelines from CA suggested he would only narrowly miss the first Test, scheduled to train at nearly full tilt with the team during the match. Coach Andrew McDonald said: “He will be up and bowling in Perth, and people will be sitting there questioning why he’s not playing.” Once Cummins got back to Sydney after watching his team’s raucous two-day win in the west, he was seen bowling in the New South Wales nets without any apparent limitations and, most notably, was using a pink Kookaburra ball in what one would assume was preparation for the day-night Test in Brisbane. So, why the change of plans, well over a month since Cummins said he would need four weeks to build up bowling loads, and with six days until the first ball in Brisbane? Not to mention eight more days of rest between Brisbane and the third Test in Adelaide. If the latter is Cummins’ destination, it will come more than seven weeks since he resumed bowling. That in itself is fine: prognoses can change, medical staff can be conservative, players can be cautious. It’s just peculiar that in the middle of the most anticipated and closely followed Test series in Australia’s calendar, the governing body’s representatives don’t appear to consider it reasonable to share any information about the captain’s fitness and availability or the changing nature of either. And if caution is the watchword with Cummins, the opposite applies with Khawaja’s back injury. He had spasms flare up in Perth during two paltry fielding innings, keeping Australia’s usual opener from doing so in both innings, and from having any influence when he did bat down the order. Even if his symptoms have subsided, the fact he’d not experienced them before surely leaves some risk that they might recur in the heat of the next Test. With Khawaja in the squad, that logically means he is due to resume opening the batting, even though Travis Head made a record-setting century in his place in Perth. Khawaja wouldn’t be picked as a reserve or to bat down the order. But again, there’s no official information about this, just the selection. This doesn’t mean that teams should have to give a whole XI when picking their squad, and plans can change. But some plans are firmer than others, and given the way Head’s whirlwind captured public attention, it would do no harm to confirm where those two players are due to bat. A bit of mystery in life is a good thing, but manufacturing it out of the broadly obvious is needless. If you’re in the business of winning over audiences, communication goes a long way."

The McLaren driver beat the Mercedes of George Russell into second and, with Lando Norris in third, it was the result the Australian required for his world championship ambitions and allows a chance to narrow the gap to the leader Norris. The other title contender, Max Verstappen, was furious with his Red Bull’s erratic performance and will start in sixth. On the first hot runs in Q3 Piastri set the pace with a 1min 20.241sec lap, four-hundredths quicker than Norris. However Verstappen was complaining his car was suffering with bouncing through the corners, lacking the stability in the fast turns that had been a strength of the car and an issue he had also experienced in the only practice session. Going off wide on his first run he did not set a competitive time on his first run. The track had rubbered in for the final laps and Verstappen was the first out. He did put in a clean lap but he was still struggling and the cars behind him were improving as the track ramped up, with his teammate Yuki Tsunoda faster than him in fifth. It was Piastri however who took the top slot with a finely judged lap of 1:20.055 and was followed home by Russell splitting the two McLarens as Norris went wide pushing hard on his final lap. Norris leads Piastri and Verstappen by 24 points and with 58 still available the title cannot be won or lost in the sprint but it could well be a factor in whether Norris is able to close it out on Sunday, or whether his rivals can force it into the final round next week in Abu Dhabi. Lewis Hamilton’s trying season continued as he was eliminated in Q1, managing only 18th on the grid. “The car won’t go any quicker,” he said, which might well sum up his first year with Ferrari. The sprint on Saturday will have a mandatory two stops, after Pirelli limited the use of tyres to a 25-lap stint as a precaution against punctures on what is an enormously demanding circuit with high lateral loads. With 57 laps to be completed all the teams will have to stop twice."

That particular word was used by former Australia fast bowler Mitchell Johnson in a strongly-worded column for the West Australian newspaper and has been a theme of the wider reaction. The majority of England players sitting out a two-day tour match in Canberra this week in favour of extra training in Brisbane only added fuel to the fire. Perceptions can only be truly changed out in the middle but the size of the task ahead of England is now considerable. This much-hyped Ashes series resumes with a day-night second Test that gets underway on Thursday at the Gabba – a ground that last witnessed an England victory back in 1986. “You can call us rubbish, call us whatever you want to,” said Stokes, before England began training with the pink Kookaburra ball at Allan Border Field in Brisbane on Saturday morning. “I think arrogant might be a little bit too far, but that’s OK. “We’ll take the rough with the smooth. I’d rather words like ‘rubbish’, but ‘arrogant’ ... I’m not so sure about that. “We didn’t have the Test match that we wanted to, but we were great in passages of that game.” Asked about the reaction from supporters, both the thousands who have made the trip to Australia and those at home watching through the night, Stokes replied: “It’s a results-based job that we’re in. We love our fans. “We know we’ve got an incredible fanbase who come out here and support us. They want to see us win. We want to win. We’re absolutely desperate. They’re absolutely desperate. We’re all on the same wavelength. “We’re doing absolutely everything within our powers and using our time as best we can to allow us to go out there to try and achieve that goal.”"

The New Lion, unbeaten in five starts, also fell in the closing stages, leaving Golden Ace to pick up the pieces at long odds, just as she had in a similarly dramatic Champion Hurdle in March after Constitution Hill suffered the first fall of his career. Golden Ace was a 25-1 chance at Cheltenham and a 22-1 shot here. While her odds were trimmed slightly for next year’s festival, the 16-1 still on offer for a successful defence of her crown is a fair reflection of her place in the pecking order over hurdles. She will never be rated within 20lb of Constitution Hill at his peak, but that Constitution Hill seems to be gone for good, replaced by an impostor whose confidence at the hurdles is shot to bits. There was a jovial cheer from a big and boisterous Newcastle crowd as Constitution Hill cleared the first hurdle . He had been sent off as favourite for the 13th time in 14 starts, despite falls at Cheltenham and Aintree in the spring and a dismal run in the Boodles Champion Hurdle at Punchestown in early May, when he looked as though he wanted to be anywhere but on a racecourse. But there was only a deep, collective groan of despair as Constitution Hill guessed and guessed again at the second flight, seemingly unsure of even the jumping basics. The result was inevitable and left Nicky Henderson, his trainer, who was watching on from Newbury, in despair at his stable star’s precipitous decline. “First and foremost he’s fine, which is all that matters,” Henderson told ITV Racing. “I loved the way he went and jumped the first and then, I just can’t believe it.” “It’s getting to something. Let’s all think about it and let’s not be rash, but it’s sad, it’s really sad. You can’t keep asking him to do it, it doesn’t seem fair on anybody. “Poor Michael [Buckley, Constitution Hill’s owner], I could cry for him. We’ve done everything, why has this habit crept in? It’s hard to go on watching it, but I can’t do any more. “Everybody has got their own ideas and we’ve listened to every theory in the book. His jumping has been great. His work has just been superb, but you’ve got to jump eight flights of hurdles and at the moment that’s something he doesn’t seem able to do.” The New Lion also emerged unscathed from his fall and unlike Constitution Hill he is a horse with his prime ahead of him. “They were going so fast, proper two-mile championship speed,” said Dan Skelton, The New Lion’s trainer. “It’s not ideal to be on the floor. We’ll dust ourselves down and get him jumping. I think he’d have won, but that’s only my opinion and he didn’t stand up.” Skelton’s afternoon improved significantly an hour later as Panic Attack, the Paddy Power Gold Cup winner two weeks ago, followed up in the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury, becoming the fourth horse in 60 years to complete the double in the same year. The £142k first prize extended Skelton’s lead in the UK Trainers’ Championship and he was cut to 1-5 by Paddy Power to win the title for the first time. Willie Mullins, who has pipped Skelton at the post in late April in the past two seasons, is 9-4 to complete a hat-trick, while Henderson and Paul Nicholls are priced up at 25-1."

The first Test finished as an eight-wicket thumping, done inside 48 hours and worthy of criticism, but it was not without a genuine wobble from the hosts en route. Either way, Ben Stokes looked to do so when his players resumed training at Allan Border Field on Saturday morning before next week’s day-night second Test at the Gabba. Gone was the “shell-shocked” captain seen during the immediate aftermath of going 1-0 down and in his place, having reflected during the past few days, a far more conciliatory figure. Performances can only truly change perceptions of this England side, but there was an acceptance from Stokes that some of the blowback has been valid. He also rowed back on calling former players such as Ian Botham, Michael Vaughan and Graham Gooch “has-beens” before the series, the trio among those to question whether their preparation were thorough enough. “I got the words I said there completely wrong,” said a sheepish Stokes. “Has-beens is a horrible word. It’s the only thing that managed to come out of my mouth at that moment. God, I’m going to be one of those one day. But it’s not at all what I meant by that.” Talk of lessons being learned is a common refrain from defeated sides but Stokes – preferring one-on-one debriefs rather than all in one room – was happy to expand on a few. Among them was his own leadership in the field, admitting that his bowling plans during Travis Head’s whirlwind assault on the target of 205 runs slightly cracked under pressure. “I could have been a lot better as captain,” he said. “I am the person who makes decisions about how we go out there and operate and I am the one who gives the plans to the bowlers. I wasn’t as clear as I normally am. The key thing for me is to be completely crystal clear with my bowlers.” A concern here is that Stokes and the head coach, Brendon McCullum, remain convinced that the target set was plenty, when the brief history of Tests at Perth Stadium shows that batting conditions improve after tea on day two. England’s collapse after lunch – the loss of four for 11 when effectively 105 for one – was where the contest was lost. This is a slightly brittle England batting lineup. Devastating on their day, no question, but one that has been bowled out inside 40 overs an alarming seven times since the start of last year. Three of these occurred in India and Pakistan – an achilles heel against spin not exactly exclusive to the current generation – but Stokes conceded the statistic told a story overall. “We keep it very simple, which is always looking to put the opposition under pressure, but also understanding the moment we need to absorb it. We know we are very, very good at the first bit and there are areas that we can be better doing the second bit. “We do understand that. We don’t shrug it off and think: ‘Next time hopefully it will happen.’ When we say: ‘We’re going to stick to what we’re doing,’ it doesn’t mean we don’t think about all of this kind of stuff.” There was also a nod to the England supporters – the thousands who have flown to Australia and those watching through the night at home – with Stokes acknowledging the frustration they have felt. “We know we’ve got an incredible fanbase who come out here and support us,” he said. “They want to see us win. We want to win. We’re absolutely desperate. They’re absolutely desperate. We’re all on the same wavelength.” Not every charge was met with a guilty plea, however. Plenty has been said about England’s attitude, with Mitchell Johnson among those to call England arrogant in the past week. The pair met on the field during the 2013-14 Ashes, a fiery encounter when Stokes first showed his appetite for the fight. Twelve years on, the all-rounder was again pushing back. “I think arrogant might be a little bit too far, but that’s OK,” said Stokes. “We take the rough with the smooth. Call us whatever you want. I’d rather words like ‘rubbish’, but ‘arrogant’ … I’m not so sure about that. We didn’t have the Test match that we wanted to, but we were great in passages of that game.” Those passages chiefly refer to a fearsome first-innings outing with the ball that saw Australia shot down for 132 all out; encouragement looking ahead, even if Mark Wood will miss the second instalment. Australia’s players are far too savvy to be writing off the tourists just yet. That said, the hosts have a distinct advantage given their far greater experience of day-night Test cricket and a record that reads 14 played, 13 won. To that end, Stokes understood why England’s decision to shoulder arms to the tour match in Canberra this weekend, save for sending three unused players, looks strange from the outside. But the sticky humidity of Brisbane and a Gabba surface likely to bounce far more than Manuka Oval support the thinking. As was the case in Perth – a fast-forward match that swung more wildly than has been acknowledged in some quarters – that call will be framed by the result."

The Big Idea. A charismatic leader or leaders propose a new and transcendent idea that promises a panacea for alienated and vulnerable people. So here we are then. They’re getting ready to storm the compound down in Brisbane. The gunships are circling. Smoke is rising from the out-houses. A lone figure, naked, shivering, the words HIGH RELEASE POINT smeared across his chest in chicken blood, has come staggering through the lines and is being led away under a blanket towards an inconclusive loan stint at Derbyshire. Do you ever miss the early days, when the world was still young? The days of Bazball 1.0, of Bazball without brains. 2. Love-Bombing. Cult leaders promise a new start, hope for a future, love, salvation within a community who all believe in the big idea. What was this thing back then? Just men on a balcony feeling good. Tattoos. Forearms. Jawlines. Elite male wellness energy. Oh sure, England’s players will claim Bazball doesn’t actually exist (“We don’t use that word”), which is funny because if it doesn’t exist what exactly did I just watch? But we know what it is. It’s Harry Brook playing a shot so depraved it has to be pixelated. It’s the thrill of Ben Stokes in his final form, a look that says: pensive Nordic god, beard made of wood, hair woven from beaver hide, so authentically Modern Savage you half-expect to look down and notice he’s fielding at mid-off stripped to the waist and cradling a wild salmon. It’s Ben Duckett still being allowed to talk in press conferences, out there looking like a happy little woodland creature in a waistcoat, saying stuff like we are actively deconstructing the orange. And yes, the energy, for quite a long time, was only good energy. 3. A New Life. Growth phase. Unity enforced by rote learning of the cult’s slogans. These beliefs are often illogical as a test of “true belief”. Is it just me? The backlash, the outrage, the sense of betrayal after the first Ashes Test defeat seems too strong, too much. England batted badly in Perth, as they often do in Australia. They were savaged in the field for a couple of hours as the bowling and captaincy fell apart, carved around by Travis Head batting like England but better, adaptive to conditions, a man playing with a kind of light around him. And now we have this, the pile-on, the rage, the sense of English Test cricket as a kind of abomination. The feeling seems to be that England don’t just need to lose from here, they need to lose righteously, to be scoured, flame-throwered, destroyed by the vengeful purity of Mitchell Starc’s movements, the low-fi orthodoxies of Scott Boland, out there celebrating his wickets with a bashful smile like he’s just been given a nice new fishing rod. What will this do to them? 4. Hate Bonding. Problems arise from failures in the plan. But the cult cannot admit errors. It starts to feed on hatred of the outside world. The fact remains, half a week out from the second Test, we have now reached a delicious point of tension in the lifespan of this thing. England could quite easily win in Brisbane in a blur of adrenal disruption. More likely, they could lose just as quickly. And if they do lose it feels like we really might be entering the death cult phase. Before that happens there are two things worth saying about this. More than two years ago, back in those heady early days of light and heat, I wrote an article suggesting Bazball was a cult. People were very angry about this, which was helpful because everyone knows the best way of proving something definitely isn’t a cult is when its acolytes send hundreds of furiously one-eyed messages objecting to the questioning of its truths. What has happened in the last few days is just as interesting. It seems that hating Bazball has now become the cult. We have a uniformly angry internet, angry English pundits, shots of angry middle-aged travelling fans cheated out of three days of cricket, like a room full of timeshare owners seeking justice. On the other we hand we have the wider backdrop of Australia’s more nuanced, more culturally hard-wired exasperation at these weirdly passive-aggressive buccaneers, out there saying, hey, that thing you love and have fostered and nurtured as one way of separating yourself culturally from us, well, it’s all a bit of a gag in the end old boy. And this is the real point. It’s all cults. Bazball was a cult because cricket is a cult. Or at least, English cricket has always been a cult, a clique, a garden party, a closed world with two hundred years of opaque and ritualistic cult history behind it. This has always been a place where power and access are hoarded. It’s the colonial game of the British, the original sports washers. And guess what, Britain is itself a cult, a series of esoteric hierarchies, a place that literally still has a king. England’s cricketers have been sealed up within this world since childhood. In trying to escape from it, to create a less brutal environment, they are simply replicating their own experience, creating another a bubble, a closed circle, but doing it this time with 15 cool guys and a coach who wants you to be yourself as long as yourself is quite a lot like myself. Live where your feet are. Run towards the danger. But no matter how fast and far you run, you’re always basically in the same place. With this mind, it is perhaps the moment to have some sympathy for Bazball, to appreciate its good points, of which there are many. What is Bazball? Creating a sense of freedom. Challenging orthodoxies. Batting aggressively and trying to take 20 wickets. It makes sense as a tactic if the short aggressive game is your best chance of winning. Plus there is the emotional side. The style, attitude and occasional mania of Bazball can be interpreted, as Mike Brearley has noted, as an active response to depression. It is easy to forget what a miserable place England Test cricket had become, or how the dynamic of the last four years leads directly from the last Covid-shadowed Ashes tour, a genuinely dark time for many of those present. If the Bazball optics suggest a kind of male wellbeing cult, then male wellbeing is good. Ben Stokes talking openly about doubt and low times, while simultaneously occupying the role of heroic and successful England captain: this is new and useful. Men are often miserable, and miserable alone, more miserable than they need to be. Plus defeat here really wouldn’t be that damning. The key questions have always been: have they got better? And is it more interesting? England can lose 4-1 in Australia and the answer on both counts is still yes. There are of course bad bits. A failure to learn or adapt, the sense that this movement only has one move, rejecting the previous movement, at which point it becomes a static entity. At times Bazball is boring. Trying to be interesting all the time is one of the most boring things you can do. But even here it remains unignorable. England have played two days of Test cricket in the last four months. Has any sporting entity existed so vividly in the imagination either side of almost total non-activity? So what now? The timeline suggests the next stages are Witch-Hunts and Persecution Paranoia, which both, let’s be honest, sound pretty mouthwatering. This is followed by Final Conflict, whereby the cult “either destroys itself or lashes out against its fantasised enemies”. Well, hopefully we won’t get there. This is in the end a group of people trapped within their own strange colonial hangover of a sport, something so moreishly beautiful it remains impossible to look away or resist. There is still time before this cult within the cult is done to burn a few more sticks of furniture, to create a sense of heat and light, to make everyone around the edges feel something."

Sherwani revealed in 2021 that had he been diagnosed with young-onset Alzheimer’s in 2019, and his family continue to raise awareness of the condition. He represented Great Britain and England 94 times, culminating in scoring two goals in his team’s 3-1 final victory over West Germany in Seoul. Sherwani’s second goal, which in effect clinched the contest, sparked a famous reaction from BBC commentator Barry Davies, who asked: “Where were the Germans? But frankly, who cares!” It sparked British hockey’s greatest moment for thousands watching at dawn back home in the UK. Imran was the third Asian player to play for GB after Sutinder Kehar and Kulbir Bhaura, his 1988 teammate. He came from a sporting family – his father played hockey for Pakistan and his great uncles played football for Stoke City and Port Vale. Recalling his greatest moment with the winning goal in Seoul, Sherwani said: “Batch [Steve Batchelor] did the German and I just carried on for his pass and met it as it came across and slotted home. It was just incredible and I think we knew then. It felt like that was it. I still get emotional about it. The win, the team, it is all just a fantastic story and I am privileged and fortunate enough to be part of it.” Rich Beer, chief operating officer of Great Britain Hockey, said: “Imran Sherwani will forever be remembered as one of the true icons of England and Great Britain Hockey. His talent, leadership and humility inspired generations of players and fans alike.” Leek Hockey Club said: “Imran was one of Leek HC’s greatest players and arguably their most influential. He joined Leek in 1996 and was the catalyst for an unprecedented period of success. “Whilst it would seem inconceivable to many that his greatest achievement wasn’t the two goals scored to win gold for Great Britain in the 1988 Olympic final, Imran often insisted the 6-2 win against Old Georgians securing Leek promotion to the National League at Belle Vue in 2003 was his proudest moment. “Imran was not only a great hockey player but a great person and will be sadly missed by all at Leek Hockey Club.”"

The list of pitstops on Lando Norris’ road to the top of Formula One is like a luxury travel agent’s catalogue. So when I was asked to trace the young man’s journey ahead of a weekend in which he could become the first British champion driver since Lewis Hamilton, my hopes were high. As the taxi pulled up outside the Clay Pigeon Raceway in Dorchester, however, my excitement was taken down a few gears. It may seem an inauspicious place to blood the talent of those who will become some of the most glamorous, fiery competitors in sport, but here, in the shadow of an industrial estate not far from Yeovil, is where a growing number of Formula One stars are made. As well as Lando, Phil Hanson and Jenson Button sped and skidded around the track as children. For Rob Dodds, who coached Norris and Hanson when they were earning their training wheels, his role in their success is hard to put into words. “It’s mad, innit,” he laughs. Norris in particular could soon enter the sport’s big leagues. Should he seal his first Formula One world championship on Sunday, he would join an exclusive club – and with sporting superstardom sealed, soon the crossover cultural status enjoyed by the likes of Hamilton will surely be close behind. That world is a long way away from the one Norris’ teacher inhabits. Dodds is a former boxer from Wales who turned to karting after sustaining an injury. He has allowed me to grace the same track as his superstar alumni to get a feel for his journey – but there is one bump in the road – I haven’t even got a driving licence. Bumper cars are the most experience I’ve had at the wheel. But really, how hard could it be? Norris himself hadn’t passed his test when he first sped around this circuit – he was seven years old. If children under 10 years old can fearlessly whiz around, surely I’d pick it up quickly. In person, the cars drive a lot faster than you see on screen. The same was true for my two-pedal kart. After being given instructions on how to operate the machine (left pedal = brake, right pedal = accelerate), I was off. Things started well; pushing my right foot down did indeed move the car, but I learned the hard way that, at the Clay Pigeon Raceway, as in Norris career, things happen very quickly. I was given an instructor to trail behind to keep me on track but, after getting cocky on a sharp turn, I spun out and lost him. I persevered and got back on track but, on the next bend, I spun out again, lodging my wheels into the well-kept grass. I’m expecting a hefty gardening bill. After a while I got the hang of it. Am I the next Hamilton? No. But I see the appeal. After leaving the track (with a final lap time of 1m 30s), Dodds recalled the first time he saw Lando drive – a memory in no way jogged by my effort. “It was obvious the kid had something,” he said. The future star was whizzing around the track aggressively, doing the lap times of drivers five years older than him (about 35s). “That was when I first noticed him,” he said. Dodds quickly took Norris under his wing. When Norris turned eight, the fledging racer marked the day by decorating his helmet and having it signed by a man he would soon race wheel to wheel with. On his birthday weekend, young Lando visited the Silverstone circuit. “He waited in the car park and got all their signatures on his crash helmet,” he said. Among those who signed was Hamilton. Lando soon found himself racing across the country every weekend. “Parents usually wait until the kids are about 10 or 11 to do national championships. We had Lando doing them from eight years old.” Typically, the driver’s ascent through the world of racing has been rapid. What does Dodds make of his current success? “I’m very proud indeed,” he said. While the 26-year-old has become an undeniable motorsport talent, there have been obstacles to navigate. Last year, he appeared to blame McLaren for losing the Canadian Grand Prix, a flash of petulance that can be forgiven in such precocious talent. On Thursday, he was disqualified from the Las Vegas Grand Prix alongside Oscar Piastri for a rule breach. “It’s motor sport. Nothing is straightforward,” said Dodds. “It’s not the first time he’s gone through things like this. He’s a professional but they forget he’s still a young man. I think he’s done really well to be honest.” Despite the last-minute setbacks, there are hopes that Lando can score his first Formula One world championship victory this weekend. Should he pull it off, Dodds would be delighted. “It’ll be a job well done. Firstly, I’d be pleased for him and then secondly, pleased for myself. It’s a bit surreal, that’s for sure. I was just doing my job,” he said."
sport_2025_nov_29_mark-wood-ashes-blow-as-england-pace-bowler-ruled-out-of-gabba-test.txt,sport,2025-11-29,Ali Martin in Brisbane,Mark Wood Ashes blow as England pace bowler ruled out of Gabba Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/29/mark-wood-ashes-blow-as-england-pace-bowler-ruled-out-of-gabba-test,"Mark Wood is set to be ruled out of England’s next Ashes Test at the Gabba after reporting soreness in the troublesome left knee that required surgery in March and forced him to miss the entire home summer. The eight-wicket defeat suffered in Perth last week was Wood’s first competitive game since the Champions Trophy in February and his first Test outing for 14 months. That he is now struggling after sending down 11 overs in the first Test is of huge concern given the size of England’s task ahead. Though a voluntary session, that Wood was missing from England’s return to the nets at Allan Border Field on Saturday morning was notable and confirmation soon followed that he had reported soreness in the joint. The second Test, starting on Thursday, is expected to come too soon. It may be that conditions in Brisbane call for a spinner to be added to the attack regardless, with Shoaib Bashir and Will Jacks the two options. If England want to stick to a five-pronged pace attack then Josh Tongue, with the Lions in Canberra, would probably be next in line. Wood’s fragility has been a theme of his stop-start career, but the lack of time off the field did not help. The 35-year-old opened the bowling on the second morning in Perth as England looked to shut down Australia’s first innings and was then back at it after tea trying to defend a small target of 205 runs. In between he was in the dressing room with his legs in a “game-ready machine” – a full-length ice pack used by fast bowlers to speed up recovery – but he was forced to take it off early and strap on the pads once England’s middle order collapsed after lunch. On the For The Love of Cricket podcast, Wood said: “I was using the ice machine in the backroom. All of a sudden we start losing wickets and I look down [at the machine] and there’s still 17 minutes to go, then another one and it’s 12 minutes left. I thought: ‘I’ve got to get off this and get ready.’ “At lunch, we are assessing what’s gone well and at no point did I think that in the next hour or so I’d be bowling again. It was one of those days.” There is no suggestion at this stage that Wood’s tour is over and another nine-day gap sits between Brisbane and the third Test in Adelaide, which starts on 17 December. Still, this latest setback follows an eight-over workout in England’s warm-up match that led to scans on a tight hamstring."

Both were significant but pole was crucial in the tense title fight with his McLaren teammate Lando Norris, who lines up alongside him on the front row of the grid, and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, who starts from third, with the three contenders set to go head to head into turn one on Sunday. Piastri has been under the cosh, reeling as his strong lead in the championship was whittled down and then surpassed by Norris and under enormous pressure simply to keep the fight alive to the final round in Abu Dhabi next week. The Australian responded well in Qatar and delivered an impressive run to take the top spot with his final lap, one that had to be inch-perfect after Norris had laid down a strong marker in a tightly fought qualifying contest. It was as good a day behind the wheel as Piastri has enjoyed since he last won, at the Dutch GP in August, which was also the last time he claimed pole. Piastri won the sprint race with a dominant drive and with Norris only third it was a vital boost to the Australian’s title ambitions, while Verstappen took fourth place dropping a point to the championship leading Briton. “Let’s go, baby!” Piastri declared over the radio after winning the sprint. With victory in the 19-lap dash, Piastri narrowed the gap to Norris by two points to 22, while Verstappen fell one point further behind, to 25 in arrears. Norris still holds the cards and can seal the championship on Sunday. He must be 26 points ahead of Piastri and Verstappen. If either of his rivals are closer than that margin then the title will be decided in Abu Dhabi. A win in the race would be enough for Norris regardless of any other results and he will also take the title if he outscores Piastri by four points and finishes ahead of Verstappen in any position. Piastri’s pole could be vital in taking the title to Abu Dhabi. The high-speed Lusail circuit, with its sequences of fast corners, is notoriously hard for overtaking, as was demonstrated in the sprint race. Drivers finding it hard to close or to enjoy a sufficient speed advantage to make a pass through corners that are taken flat-out. If Piastri can keep his nose in front after the long drag to the first corner, in what will be a mandated two-stop race making strategies likely to converge, he will have every shot at controlling the race to the flag and taking the title to the wire. He knows he is fighting to stay in the game but finally was able to enjoy his performance after what has been a late-season slump. “Winning is a lot more fun than whatever the hell happened the last four or five races, that’s for sure,” he said. “You always try and enjoy it. When you look at the bigger picture, even in the last few weeks that have been tough I’m still driving probably the fastest car or one of the fastest cars there’s ever been in the world and I love all of that.” Norris had looked on course to deny his teammate when, at the sharp end in Q3, he opened the running with a roaring lap, his best of the day, with a time of 1min 19.495sec. Piastri pushed hard but could not quite match it at just three-hundredths down. Norris had the advantage entering the final laps and once more led the way but he went slightly wide at turn two, a small error but enough to make him abort his lap and it was costly. “I just caught a bit of an understeer for some reason,” he said. “That was it. So I’m a bit frustrated because I certainly think I could have done a better job.” Piastri followed, was quicker in the two opening sectors, and grabbed the top spot. The serious business is yet to come but he could do no more than finishing on top both times when push came to shove and ensuring Norris will have no easy ride to his first F1 title. After the sprint race Norris also hit back at Verstappen’s comments, made earlier in the weekend, when the Dutchman stated he would already have won the world championship if he had been driving a McLaren. “He generally has a good clue about a lot of things, but there is also a lot of things he doesn’t have much of a clue about,” Norris said. “But it is also Red Bull’s way of going about things, an aggressive nature and just talking nonsense a lot of the time. “It depends if you want to listen to it and talk about it like he would love you to do, or do what we do as a team which is keeping our heads down and stay focused. Maybe he would have done [won the title easily] but he hasn’t done so far.” Lewis Hamilton’s trying weekend in a poorly performing Ferrari continued as he went out in Q1 in 18th place, having managed only 17th in the sprint race."
sport_2025_nov_29_wales-south-africa-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report.txt,sport,2025-11-29,Michael Aylwin at the Principality Stadium,Etzebeth red mars South Africa romp as Wales slump to record home defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/29/wales-south-africa-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report,"Every bit as dispiriting as expected. Worse, was it pointless? Well, it certainly had more points to it than Wales would have liked. But, worse again, was it actively alienating? A record defeat, 11 tries conceded, the first time since 1967 Wales have failed to score a point in Cardiff. The opposition on that day 58 years ago, Ireland, scored 70 fewer than the Springboks here. “It’s quite a raw, emotional dressing room,” said Dewi Lake, Wales’s captain. “The boys are proud Welshmen, so coming off the field with the scoreboard looking like that is tough to take. But I don’t think it’s going to ruin the confidence of the younger boys. If anything, it drives you even more. You recognise the gap and what you’ve got to do.” South Africa continue to demonstrate their superiority over every other nation. People are starting to compare them to the best sides we have ever seen. And they remain as brutal as ever, mostly legitimately, sometimes less so. They received their third red card of the autumn, their third to a second-row, but there was no arguing with this one. Eben Etzebeth, a full head taller than any of his opponents in the middle of a fracas two minutes from time, jabbed his thumb into the eye of Alex Mann. The least contentious red card of the autumn. “It didn’t look good,” said Rassie Erasmus. “I think it was a justified red card. How it happened and why it happened I don’t know. That’s definitely not the way we would have liked to end the game.” The buildup to this Test was dominated by its characterisation as the game no one wanted, each side surrendering upwards of a dozen players to their respective clubs in England and France, the international window now shut. The Welsh regions were stretched as well, shipping in players on loan to fulfil their fixtures in the United Rugby Championship. But the harsh truth is, the Welsh Rugby Union is also down to its bare bones. People like to tut and roll their eyeballs when the making of money is seen as prioritised over player welfare, but there is a difference between “making money” and not haemorrhaging it. The extra revenue from this fixture, no matter the stadium was two-thirds full, is precious indeed as the WRU faces up to the realities of the professional era, approaching the end of its third decade. The bookies gave Wales a 40-point head start. South Africa had covered that only five minutes into the second half, when Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu, continuing to play on another plane from most people in rugby, certainly anyone in Wales, scored the first of his two tries. He converted that, just as he had the previous six tries. The Springbok fly-half ended up with a haul of 28 points. None of South Africa’s 11 tries were dazzling. Imagine if they had actually played at their best. They had four in the first half, all based around an utterly dominant scrum. Ethan Hooker’s try, South Africa’s second, straight from that set piece was nicely worked. The others were a story of brutal physicality. Wales had one lineout in the Springbok 22 in the first half. They overthrew it. They had another – and their first piece of possession in the opposition “red zone” as people like to call it these days – in the 58th minute. They worked a few phases, then Kwagga Smith was over the ball to win the penalty. End of that little interlude. Smith was on because South Africa brought on all eight replacements 10 minutes into the second half, which meant seven forwards, the whole pack replaced bar Ruan Nortjé, who weighed in with a try himself 10 minutes from time. Etzebeth led the phalanx of replacements. For a side to be 49-0 down and face the introduction of players of that calibre is almost too much, whether an international window is shut or not. Etzebeth battered his way over from close range for a try with five minutes to go, the 11th and final of the rout. And then, that grin never far from his face, he took his menace too far. Rarely can an act of barbarity have seemed so pointless. Never has a match here in this famous stadium been so full of points for the opposition."

Immediately after picking up the award, the Swedish pole vaulter took aim at Michael Johnson’s Grand Slam Track, which collapsed in the summer and is still yet to pay athletes their full prize money. “There was another tour that tried to exclude field events,” Duplantis said to an audience that included multiple athletics stars as well Prince Albert II of Monaco. “That didn’t didn’t go so well, did it? I am very proud to represent field eventers.” That received applause and laughter in the room, and there was more when Duplantis, who was unbeaten in 16 competitions in 2025, said he was “delighted and honoured to win the award – I just love pushing myself and pushing boundaries”. The female athlete of the year award was won by the American Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, who won world 400m gold in Tokyo in 47.78sec – the second fastest time in history. For good measure McLaughlin-Levrone, who is now unbeaten in 24 races, also won the women track athlete of the year too. She also became the first athlete to have won world titles in both the 400m flat and 400m hurdles, and was part of USA’s gold medal-winning 4x400m team in Tokyo. “Honestly I am blown away,” she said. “I don’t feel deserving to be honest. But Tokyo was a really special moment and I am so thankful for this honour and recognition.” Elsewhere, the Australian high-jumper Nicola Olyslagers won the women’s field award, while the 800m world champion Emmanuel Wanyonyi of Kenya won the men’s track world honour. The London marathon winner Sabastian Sawe won the out of men’s stadium athlete of the year, while the Spanish race walker María Pérez won the women’s award."

The 18-year-old went 13 for 22 from the field in his 20th career game. The top pick in this year’s draft also grabbed eight rebounds. The only other 18-year-old to score 35 points in an NBA game is LeBron James, who did so twice in his rookie season. His first came when he was 18 years and 348 days old, five days older than Flagg was on Saturday. “He’s only 18 years old, but he seems like he’s been in this league before,” Mavs coach Jason Kidd said. “He did it all tonight. He had the ball. You can call it point guard or whatever, but he ran the offense for us. He drove the ball. The ball touched the paint. He got to the rim, got to the free throw line, stepped up and made free throws for us late. Just his composure on both ends [impressed me]. He competes at a very high level. You saw that tonight, but you saw that last night, too.” Flagg also impressed in Friday’s game, when he faced James’s Lakers. In that game, he had 11 assists, an NBA record for an 18-year-old. His 35-year-old teammate, Klay Thompson, is another admirer. “Cooper’s upside is limitless,” Thompson said. “He has every tool to be great. Sometimes I can’t believe he should be a freshman in college.” Flagg was aggressive all game against the Clippers, including a spectacular dunk over Ivica Zubac. “Being aggressive right now is obviously right for me, and that’s what Coach has stressed to me,” said Flagg. “I’ve got to be aggressive, and we’ll live with some of the mistakes, but you just have to be aggressive and trust all the work.” Thompson also had an impressive outing: he hit four three-pointers in the fourth quarter, his final one putting Dallas ahead for good with 1:51 left. He shot 6 of 10 from long distance overall as the Mavericks snapped a three-game losing streak. He finished with 23 points, 17 of which came in the final quarter. Kawhi Leonard led Los Angeles with 30 points and eight rebounds. James Harden added 29 points, 11 assists and eight boards for the Clippers, who dropped their fourth consecutive game. John Collins scored 21 and Ivica Zubac had 19 points and 11 boards. Los Angeles (5-15) have lost seven straight at the Intuit Dome since beating New Orleans 126-124 on Halloween night. The Mavericks (6-15) scored 20 points off 18 Clippers turnovers."

Katoa was ruled out of the 2026 NRL season after undergoing emergency surgery in New Zealand to treat a brain bleed that he suffered while playing for Tonga in the Pacific Championships in early November. The Melbourne Storm second-rower’s career was thrown into doubt after he suffered three head knocks in 90 minutes and required oxygen on the sidelines. Katoa spent more than two weeks in hospital before consulting with specialists in Melbourne, who advised that he not play next season. The 25-year-old is continuing his rehabilitation and recovery under the watch of the Storm medical staff, and said he hoped to play again. “I’m back at home at the moment and I’m in a good place now,” Katoa posted on Instagram. “My recovery is going well and hopefully I can keep ticking all of the boxes that I need!” Katoa thanked people for their messages and the Storm club for its support, and included a tribute to his partner Tuitofa Aloua. “This woman has been amazing, strong and sticking by my side through it all,” he wrote. “A special thank you to the Storm for all of the help and support that you guys are continuing to provide, I appreciate it. “And to the Storm fans, in God’s timing ‘I’ll be back soon’.” Ryan Papenhuyzen, who also won’t play with Melbourne next season after walking away from his contract, was one of Katoa’s teammates to respond. “Health is wealth king, look after yourself my bro,” wrote the star full-back, who has also endured career-threatening injuries. Katoa’s post included some confronting images of him in hospital, showing where his head had been shaved for the surgery. The loss of Katoa and Papenhuyzen, representative prop Nelson Asofa-Solomona and promising half Jonah Pezet puts a dent in Melbourne’s aspirations of winning a title after two successive grand-final losses. The Storm will receive salary cap relief for Katoa, but the Dally M second-rower of the year is almost impossible to replace. The NRL has completed an investigation into Tonga’s handling of his injuries, but is yet to release its findings. With Australian Associated Press"
sport_2025_nov_30_joe-root-not-a-fan-of-day-night-ashes-test-but-aware-he-needs-to-shine-under-lights.txt,sport,2025-11-30,Ali Martin in Brisbane,Joe Root not a fan of day-night Ashes Test but aware he needs to shine under lights,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/30/joe-root-not-a-fan-of-day-night-ashes-test-but-aware-he-needs-to-shine-under-lights,"It rarely takes much for an Englishman to be accused of whingeing in Australia but when Joe Root was asked a simple question on Sunday – whether a series such as the Ashes actually needs day-night Test cricket – he simply gave an honest answer. “I personally don’t think so,” replied Root, before England took to the nets at the Gabba for Thursday’s second Test. “It’s obviously very successful and popular here, and obviously Australia have got a very good record [played 14, won 13]. You can see why we’re playing one of those games. “Ultimately, you know from two years out it is going to be there. It’s part and parcel of making sure you’re ready for it. A series like this, does it need it? I don’t think so … but it doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be here either. I don’t mind it. I mean, I don’t think it’s as good as traditional Test cricket. But it’s in the schedule. We’ve got to play it and just got to make sure we’re better than them at it.” Like his opposite number, Steve Smith, Root’s typically stellar numbers take a bit of a nose dive against the pink ball. The Yorkshireman has played all seven of England’s floodlit Tests and, despite a century in his first outing against West Indies in 2017, a career average of 50.9 drops to 38.5. Conversely, the bowler Mitchell Starc averages 28.97 at a strike rate of 49.9 overall but 17.08 and 33.3 respectively with a pink ball. In the left-armer’s last such outing, in Jamaica in July, he claimed six for nine as West Indies were razed for 27 all out — career-best figures that lasted all of one Test match after taking seven for 58 on day one in Perth. The head-to-head between Root and Starc is already shaping up to be one of the deciding factors in this series. Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood have traditionally bothered him far more but, in their absence last week, it was the evergreen Starc who wiped him out for scores of nought and eight. The first was just a good ball, Root has since reasoned; the kind that would likely not carry to slip back home. The second, bowled chopping on amid England’s second-day collapse, was a miscalculation on his part. “I know I’m a good player,” he said. “I know I’m going to be able to score runs again.” Wobble-seam has become Starc’s weapon of choice these days – he wished he had listened to Hazlewood and Cummins about it sooner – but in muggy Brisbane there may well be swing on offer too. England, 1-0 down, have even more to overcome this week and runs from their premier batter would go some way towards them emerging from their self-inflicted hole. This may not necessarily require a century should another rapid-fire shootout unfold but Root’s lack of one on Australian soil continues to follow him on tour. “I didn’t have long enough to think about it,” was his latest self-effacing answer, when asked if the statistic had preyed on his mind in Perth. Root and his teammates went hard at it on Sunday, with some American west coast hip-hop serving as the soundtrack to an Australian east coast session on a sweltering afternoon. Monday and Wednesday are the key days for England’s preparations, taking place in the evening under lights. Mark Wood’s absence with a growling knee has opened up a spot in the XI and the sight of Will Jacks in the nets among the main group of batters offered a possible clue as to the favourite to come in. The all-rounder’s off-breaks are serviceable and extra runs at No 8 could offset those he leaks with the ball. That said, Josh Tongue has been with the Lions in Canberra and remains a live option were England to stick with all-out pace, while the off-spinner Shoaib Bashir was in the 12-man matchday squad last week. Much to ponder, then, at a ground where England have not won a Test for more than 40 years. “It is a chance to make a bit of history,” said Root, regarding this statistic. “It would make it all the sweeter if we get over the line here.”"
sport_2025_nov_30_lando-norris-and-oscar-piastri-voice-frustration-at-mclarens-strategy.txt,sport,2025-11-30,Giles Richards at Lusail International Circuit,Norris and Piastri voice frustration at McLaren’s strategy as title race goes to finale,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/30/lando-norris-and-oscar-piastri-voice-frustration-at-mclarens-strategy,"Lando Norris, the championship leader, has decried the McLaren team strategy error at the Qatar Grand Prix that allowed Max Verstappen right back into the fight and forced a three-way battle at next Sunday’s title-deciding finale in Abu Dhabi. Verstappen won the race in Doha after McLaren chose not to pit their drivers under a safety car early in the race. It was a costly error that gave Verstappen the lead and the win. Norris could finish only fourth and his teammate Oscar Piastri, who was equally unhappy with the team, was second. Norris had been 24 points ahead of both Piastri and Verstappen going into the weekend but now leads Verstappen by only 12 points and Piastri by 16. “Obviously not our greatest day, not our greatest weekend,” said Norris, who believed McLaren should have pitted Piastri and him when Verstappen and the rest of the field were called in. “Both of us should have done. I would have been had over either way, because we would have double-stacked and potentially I would have lost time. A bit of time. I wouldn’t have lost a position, I don’t think.” Piastri, who showed superb pace as he tried to hunt down Verstappen, was asked to describe his level of frustration with the team. “Pretty high and I think that’s saying quite a lot, given the last few races I’ve had,” he said. “Clearly we didn’t get it right today, which is a shame, because the whole weekend went very, very well. We had a lot of pace. I felt like I drove well. So yeah, it’s pretty painful.” However, the Australian and Norris conceded the team would review the decision and address it before the finale in Abu Dhabi. “I put myself in this position. I’m still happy,” said Norris. “It wasn’t our finest day, it wasn’t my finest weekend in terms of driving and putting things together. But that’s life. Everyone has bad weekends. I take it on the chin, we’ll take it on the chin, and we’ll see what we can do next weekend.” Piastri said: “I think we made a wrong decision today. I think that’s clear. It’s not like the world ended. Obviously it hurts at the moment, but with time, things will get better.” McLaren received a double disqualification at the last round in Las Vegas and the team principal, Andrea Stella, admitted they had to improve. “The drivers are doing an exceptionally good job,” he said. “But over the last couple of races, from a team point of view, we have not been in condition to capitalise on the good work of the drivers and the potential we have in the car. We have to acknowledge as a team that our drivers have all the reasons to be disappointed.” McLaren have faced questions for allowing their drivers to race one another all season, rather than prioritising one to seal the title, but Stella confirmed they would not be changing their approach or employing team orders at the season-deciding race. “We will confirm our racing approach, but certainly what I can say is that if any of the drivers is in a condition to pursue the quest to win the title, then we will respect this,” he said. “There will be no call which excludes the other drivers when the other driver is in a condition to win. “Whatever call we make in terms of using the collaboration of our drivers, we will have to follow some of our fundamental principles, which are foundational to our approach. We want to be fair to our drivers, we want to race with integrity, and we want to race in a way that doesn’t surprise our drivers. Between now and Abu Dhabi, there will be a further conversation with Lando and Oscar.” Verstappen, who had trailed Piastri, the then championship leader by 104 points after the Dutch Grand Prix on 31 August and had appeared to be out of contention, was enormously pleased to still be in the title battle at the death. “This year we just had a really tough first half of the season, as everyone knows, but to still be in this fight, I think we can be really proud of it,” he said, “because in the middle of the season at some point it was almost not like you lose motivation, but it’s just you don’t really see a way forward of actually winning again in this season.”"

Yet the Dutchman, while down, was far from out and has, with victory in the Qatar Grand Prix, battled and bludgeoned his way back into contention just as McLaren have somehow contrived to leave Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri vulnerable to his late charge, as Verstappen forced the title race to the wire at the final round next weekend in Abu Dhabi. With Lando Norris, the title leader, fourth and his teammate Oscar Piastri second in Doha, after McLaren made an egregious strategy error, there will now be a three-way fight to the finish at the season finale, with 16 points separating all three drivers. Verstappen is 12 points back from Norris, with Piastri a further four worse off. It is a scenario that was all but unthinkable when Verstappen was 104 points behind Piastri after the Dutch Grand Prix on 31 August and he had in effect written off his championship ambitions. Earlier in the weekend the McLaren chief executive, Zak Brown, had jokingly compared Verstappen to the horror movie trope of a character that will simply not stay dead. The world champion’s response as he revelled in the sheer glee of lurching back into McLaren’s nightmares was simply: “You can call me Chucky.” Within whose fever dreams he must now loom larger than ever. What was considered to be McLaren’s party to close out the season is now set to be a nerve-jangling, pressure-filled finale, one where they are faced with having a fired-up Verstappen on a charge to try to take what would be the unlikeliest of titles and would stand as his greatest achievement. Verstappen won from third place after a superb drive but was given an enormous leg up when McLaren chose not to pit both their drivers under an early safety car when the rest of the field did so to take a free stop. It ensured Verstappen took the lead and as the stops played out he could not be caught. Norris took damage when he went off wide and was unable to stay with the two leaders and Carlos Sainz, who was third. Norris and Piastri decried the team’s strategy decision and, coming on the back of receiving a double disqualification for the pair at the last round in Las Vegas, it seems McLaren are engineering their own problems as they stumble and stagger toward the finish line. A once simple two‑horse race between the pair may now be snatched from their grasp at the death. There are 25 points for the winner in Abu Dhabi and Norris will still seal it if he finishes in front of his two rivals there or at least third, but the finale will be far more closely fought than he would have liked having gone into the race in Doha with a 24-point advantage over both Piastri and Verstappen. The defending champion had a mountain to climb to stay in the fight three months ago but when Red Bull brought upgrades to their car that addressed the balance issues that had plagued it for most of the season, he exploited it and as the two McLaren drivers took points from one another, the world champion came hurtling up the rails. McLaren, who have not won a drivers’ championship since 2008 and not done the drivers’ and constructors’ double since 1998, have left themselves exposed, promoting more questions about their policy of not choosing to favour one driver to close out the title. They have let them race throughout and the team principal, Andrea Stella, insisted after the race they would rigorously continue to do so in Abu Dhabi. Indeed it appears this fervent desire for scrupulous fairness to them both played a part behind the decision not to take the free pit stop, when every other team did so when a safety car was called on lap seven. Stella explained that it was a “misjudgment”, where they been caught out expecting other teams to also stay out, which would have put the McLarens in traffic had they come in. He also admitted, though, that it was prompted by the fact that Norris would have lost time and places as they double-stacked both cars at once in the pits. It was compounded by the fact that there were two stops which had to be made so they could not adapt strategy on the hoof. Pirelli had limited the use of tyres for the race to a 25-lap stint, making the 57-lap contest a mandatory two-stop as a precaution against punctures on what is an enormously demanding circuit with high lateral loads on the rubber. This pursuit of fairness, then, has ultimately cost both drivers and allowed Verstappen in through the back door. Piastri, who had been on pole and demonstrated in the race how fearsomely quick he could be in Qatar, was palpably furious that what he felt had been a likely win had been snatched from his grasp, saying only at the end that he was “speechless” with a face like thunder and a square‑set jaw. Norris too felt the team had missed a trick but he might have made third but for taking damage to his car. Indeed he took fourth only at the death when Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli made an error and let him through; significantly, the extra two points mean third will be sufficient for Norris in Abu Dhabi. Verstappen’s engineer, Gianpiero Lambiase, initially believed the Italian had simply moved over for Norris, an accusation for which he subsequently apologised and which the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, described as “brainless and total and utter nonsense”.

The Guardian has learned that Middlesex have handed the complaint over to the Cricket Regulator, which has launched an investigation into the matter. Cornish is understood to have stepped away from the club 10 days ago. Middlesex declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian, but the club’s board is expected to inform staff on Monday about Cornish’s absence. Cornish denies any inappropriate behaviour, and he has claimed to be unaware of the details of any complaints made against him. He also declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian, but is understood to have told colleagues within cricket that he has taken some time away from Middlesex for personal reasons. The investigation into Cornish has come a critical time for Middlesex, who will meet members at Lord’s on Tuesday in a separate meeting for talks over the future of the club. As the Guardian revealed in August, Middlesex have had offers from two international investment groups over a funding deal that would enable the club to build a permanent home away from Lord’s. Securing external investment may require Middlesex to take the club into private ownership, which would need the’ approval of their members in a formal ballot. Cornish has been leading the investment process and would ordinarily have presented the club’s plans to members. The club’s chairman, Richard Sykes, is expected to take the lead at the members’ forum on Tuesday. The Cricket Regulator is an independent disciplinary and compliance body that was set up by the England and Wales Cricket Board in 2022 after its governance system was criticised by MPs following complaints of racism by the former Yorkshire cricketer Azeem Rafiq. Middlesex have faced two other recent investigations from the newly formed regulator. In September 2023 Middlesex was fined £50,000 and given a suspended points deduction by the Cricket Discipline Commission, the body that hears cases after charges are brought by the regulator, after being found guilty of spending central funding allocated for grassroots programmes on its first team. In June 2024 the club was charged by the regulator after receiving complaints about the alleged behaviour of a senior member of staff. In November 2024 Middlesex was cleared of improper conduct following a disciplinary hearing by the CDC. That complaint is understood to have not been about Cornish. Cornish was appointed by Middlesex four years ago after initially joining the club in September 2020 as a consultant. He was previously chief executive at Somerset, who sacked him in 2019 amid concerns over the club’s financial performance. The Cricket Regulator declined to comment on the investigation into Cornish."
sport_2025_nov_30_saracens-bath-prem-rugby-match-report.txt,sport,2025-11-30,Gerard Meagher at the StoneX Stadium,Arundell crowns Bath comeback victory at Saracens to advance England claims,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/30/saracens-bath-prem-rugby-match-report,"In the battle of the X-factor wingers with England ambitions, fleetness of foot edged out the head for heights. Henry Arundell came out on top of a captivating duel with Noah Caluori to crown a fine individual showing with a second try and finally sink Saracens. That the Bath head coach offered comparisons with Bryan Habana is a demonstration of just how impressive Arundell’s performance was. It may be reductive to condense such an absorbing, chaotic multifaceted contest into a singular head‑to‑head but the contest between Caluori and Arundell was thrilling. Saracens’ early ascendancy owed much to Caluori’s aerial skills – Owen Farrell kicked for him to chase four times in the opening eight minutes – while Bath’s revival from 14-3 down was sparked by an Arundell intercept that had Johann van Graan recalling Habana in his heyday. He finished off the decisive score four minutes from time and held up well in the face of Saracens’ aerial bombardment, with Caluori’s influence waning in the second half. Arundell appeared for England only off the bench against Fiji in the autumn series but his defensive showing and blistering pace should make Steve Borthwick take notice. Habana made intercepts such as Arundell’s here his trademark and England would clearly benefit from such a potent weapon of their own. “That’s a nine-out-of-10 performance, we know about his speed and he’s worked so hard on his defence,” Van Graan said. “It’s such a good read at such a big moment in the game. “When I was at the Bulls in 2005 and Bryan joined us, we played against the Brumbies in Canberra. He had this straight-line run and that’s the thought that went into my head, in terms of speed they are the two quickest players I have coached.” Saracens, for their part, excelled for large parts. Farrell looked at home on his first appearance in the No 10 jersey since rejoining the club. Ben Earl, fresh from signing a new contract until 2029, continued his fine international form, while Elliot Daly was accomplished on his first club outing of the season. Van Graan described the match as “two heavyweight boxers” and Saracens landed the first significant blows. Ultimately, however, they paid the price for Tom Willis’s first‑half injury and were given a painful reminder that while it used to be they who boasted the deepest squad, that accolade now resides firmly with Bath, who made seven simultaneous substitutions midway through the second half. It was a demonstration of why Bath are favourites for the Premiership title and it would be no surprise if it were Saracens standing in their way of a successful defence at Twickenham come June. With Farrell pulling the strings from fly-half and Daly acting as a second playmaker, Saracens were on top early on and Max Malins, England’s forgotten winger, was the beneficiary, Saracens working the ball to the left for a comfortable finish. A second try reinforced Saracens’ early dominance, finished by Juan Martín González but owing everything to Earl’s delightful running line and Farrell’s ability to fizz a pass just where he wanted it. It was in the buildup that Willis sustained the injury that forced his premature exit just a few minutes later, however. Saracens continued to seek out Caluori and though there is a buzz of anticipation every time the 19-year-old sets off, they did so with increasingly limited impact. He will always keep defences interested but to give him his dues, Arundell stuck to the task manfully. Caluori gathered the restart after a Finn Russell penalty had got Bath on the scoreboard but Arundell picked off Ivan van Zyl’s pass near his own 22, pinned back his ears and raced away to the try line. Arundell’s score gave Bath a foothold but Malins had his second after a fierce burst up the middle from Theo Dan. A Farrell drop goal – with his father, Andy, watching – cheered the StoneX Stadium crowd but Thomas du Toit’s try after a rumbling Bath driving maul ensured just a five-point deficit at the interval. The third quarter belonged firmly to Bath. They battered away in the left corner and while Saracens withstood the bludgeon they succumbed to the blade when the quick-thinking Ben Spencer put Will Butt over. Four minutes later they took the lead with the best try of the match, begun by Russell, finished by Arthur Green but owing everything to Josh Bayliss’s pace on the left and Arundell’s canny kick inside to Spencer. Saracens levelled the scores again at 29-29 – a tiring slugger fighting back in the 11th round – with González going over from close range. But while both sides threatened to deliver the telling blow in a topsy-turvy finish, Max Ojomoh – a week after lighting up Twickenham on his home England debut – straightened and released Arundell for the decisive score."
sport_2025_nov_30_travis-head-second-ashes-test-batting-opener-felxibility-key.txt,sport,2025-11-30,Simon Burnton in Brisbane,Head ready to open again in second Ashes Test and says flexible batters will be key,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/30/travis-head-second-ashes-test-batting-opener-felxibility-key,"Having swashbuckled Australia to victory after vaulting to the top of the order in the first Ashes Test, Travis Head arrived in Brisbane on Sunday to begin his preparations for the second, saying that the future of the format lies in the hands of batters who can flex into a variety of positions. Head described pliable positions as “where the game’s going to”, proposing that Australia could already “use these players in a range of different ways to win games of cricket”. Last month Pat Cummins, Australia’s injured captain, described the concept of batting orders as “pretty overrated”, insisting quality players “can bat wherever” – an opinion Head echoed. “I think you could use this order and these players in a range of different ways to win games of cricket,” he said. “We’ve seen it in red-ball, and particularly pink-ball, as well as non-traditional stuff, with double nightwatchmen, and how you use orders and how you use players in certain situations. I agree with Pat that they’re slightly overrated. That I guess is where the game’s going to, and it’s when do you use that, when’s the right time, when’s it acceptable, and we’re going to have good moments of it and we’re going to have bad moments of it. It’s ever-evolving. We’ll see where we get to. “I feel like I can play in any role, so I’m open to it, and it’s just trying to work out in game and in moments when that may come out and when you may use that, but I think all options are on the table and have been for a long period of time, about where this team can potentially get better and where there are opportunities to potentially win games of cricket in moments. I think it’s always been on the table.” Head reiterated his readiness to open the batting again in Brisbane this week and that he was “preparing for anything at this stage”. One thing he is not doing, however, is worrying about the pink ball – “It’s still a cricket ball” – and the impact of playing much of the match under floodlights. “There’s a lot talked about lights and when it does things and what it does and doesn’t do,” he said. “You’ve just got to play the game in front of you. Some wickets are greener, some flatten out, some crack, some spin. The game and the wicket evolves over five days, the ball sometimes plays differently in different moments. “I guess half the skill of cricket is being able to adapt to moments and problem solve on the go. There’s definitely those throughout pink-ball games, and the best team that’s able to problem-solve on the go and generally just play the game of cricket and not overthink too much will find themselves having a pretty good week.”"

During the third-quarter of Sunday’s game between the Commanders and Broncos, the Washington receiver reached behind him as he fell backwards in the end zone and grabbed a Marcus Mariota pass with his right hand. He secured the ball as he fell to the turf and his touchdown tied the game at 13-13. The catch was reminiscent of Beckham’s catch for the Giants in 2014, which also game on NBC’s Sunday Night Football broadcast. However, that catch – which also resulted in a touchdown – came via a longer pass. Beckham was one of the first to praise Burks. “13 13,” he wrote on X, a reference to the jersey number the two receivers share. Burks’ touchdown was just the second of his four-year NFL career. The Tennessee Titans selected him in the first-round of the 2022 draft but he was released by the team earlier this season and was generally viewed as a bust. He was only added to the Commanders’ active roster after an injury to Luke McCaffrey. Burks’ grab was not the only brilliant one-handed catch on Sunday. Brock Bowers dove low to snag a touchdown for the Raiders in their loss to the Chargers."
sport_blog_2025_dec_02_constitution-hill-should-never-be-asked-to-jump-a-hurdle-in-public-again-horse-racing-talking-horses.txt,sport,2025-12-02,Greg Wood,Constitution Hill should never be asked to jump a hurdle in public again,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/dec/02/constitution-hill-should-never-be-asked-to-jump-a-hurdle-in-public-again-horse-racing-talking-horses,"Trainer Nicky Henderson and owner Michael Buckley are still mulling over the options for Constitution Hill after his third fall in four starts at Newcastle on Saturday, but the simple fact that Henderson floated the question “can we go on asking him to do it?” in the immediate aftermath suggests that, in his heart, he already knows the answer. Whatever else might beckon for the eight-year-old – and a recent 160+ rating over timber suggests that he could compete at a very decent level on the Flat – this is a horse that should not be asked to jump a hurdle in public again. Henderson’s competitive streak is as fierce as ever after nearly half a century in the game, and so too his appetite for a challenge. As such, it would be odd if the urge to attempt a repeat of Sprinter Sacre’s unlikely return to Grade One-winning form at the 2016 festival was not nagging away at the back of his mind somewhere. Sprinter Sacre’s second Champion Chase victory was one of the great Cheltenham moments of recent decades, and Constitution Hill, after all, set off as the 4-11 favourite for the Champion Hurdle just eight months ago, with an unbeaten 10-race record to his name. Festival racegoers also love nothing more than a returning champion, and the compelling narrative of a triumph against all odds. But Constitution Hill’s decline has been so steep and abrupt, and so obviously the result of a loss of confidence at the obstacles, that the risk-reward calculation – for the horse, his connections and for the sport in general – is entirely different. Whatever else ailed him during a stop-start second half to his career, Sprinter Sacre’s jumping was always rock-solid. Constitution Hill’s problem, though, was as plain as day at Newcastle on Saturday: the mid-air moment when uncertainty kicked in. Henderson reported in the run-up to the Fighting Fifth Hurdle that Constitution Hill’s schooling had gone well, but back on a racecourse and at racing speed, his split-second of indecision made a fall all but inevitable. As Barry Geraghty, who was closely involved in buying Constitution Hill as a foal and then steering him towards the Henderson stable, told RTÉ afterwards: “You can school at home, jump perfectly in a relaxed environment, but you go to the racecourse and have that energy, that tension, and boom, he takes a chance. It’s a really difficult thing to un-train out of a horse, if you like.” Perhaps it is a sign of a flight animal’s survival instinct coming to the fore. What Constitution Hill wants to avoid above all is another fall, and an unfortunate result is that in the heat of competition, that actually makes a fall more likely. But the implication is that if Constitution Hill’s first fall at Cheltenham in March planted the seed of uncertainty in his mind, no amount of home schooling will do much to reduce the chance of another fall if he returns to the track. It also feels like a stretch to suggest, as Henderson did on Sunday, that the padded hurdles which are being steadily rolled out across all British jumps tracks are to blame for Constitution Hill’s jumping issues. “I know we like Kempton [where Constitution Hill has won three Christmas Hurdles], but it is those hurdles I would want to avoid more than anything,” Henderson told PA Media. “For all the words that have been said from the people who have very kindly rung up trying to advise us, the most common denominator – and I believe they are right – is those padded hurdles, they are horrible. “The poor The New Lion did the same thing as Constitution Hill [at Newcastle on Saturday], and State Man did the same in the Champion Hurdle [in March], they have all made the same mistake. The trouble is we happen to have done it three times, whereas they have only done it once, the poor devils. “Out of all the people ringing up, by far the most common thing they have said is they should get rid of those hurdles and I couldn’t agree with them more.” The British Horseracing Authority, though, was quick to defend the padded hurdles on Monday, pointing to clear statistical evidence that both falls and injuries have been reduced since their introduction. “Since their phased introduction 10 years ago, the hurdles have shown that they reduce the risk of falling by 11% compared to birch hurdles,” a spokesperson said. “Since 2016 the overall faller rate over hurdles has decreased from 1.96% to 1.65%, with other factors such as the move from orange to white obstacles also contributing to this. “They have also shown a reduction in injuries, including those caused by splinters which sometimes associated with the birch hurdles, as well as fewer skin-related injuries.” There was perhaps a slight element of misfortune in Constitution Hill’s first fall back in March, as he jumped a panel which came back at him slightly after being rattled by Brighterdaysahead, who jumped it a couple of lengths in front of him. But it is also the case that the astonishingly quick, brave and accurate jumping style that was a key element of Constitution Hill’s brilliance in his prime left little margin for error. When, suddenly, it let him down, it was the fall itself, rather than the finer points of hurdle design, that seems to have become lodged in his brain. Again, it is only natural for Constitution Hill’s connections to look for reasons – and so, presumably, possible remedies – for his sudden decline, but his standing as one of hurdling’s all-time greats has long since been secure. Henderson’s initial instinct was spot on. There is no need to attempt to write a glorious final chapter, when an alternative ending does not bear thinking about.

sport_blog_2025_dec_03_usman-khawaja-injury-cricket-test-future-out-of-his-hands.txt,sport,2025-12-03,Geoff Lemon in Brisbane,Flailing Usman Khawaja’s Test future now lies out of his own hands,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/dec/03/usman-khawaja-injury-cricket-test-future-out-of-his-hands,"As far as surprises go, a 38.95-year-old with a back problem continuing to have a back problem is not up there with the end of The Sixth Sense. The only twists in this story are the ones that Usman Khawaja can’t currently do. With the second Ashes Test in Brisbane coming up on 4 December, the capricious nature of such injuries made it odd that the batter was included in the first place in Australia’s squad on 30 November, and less odd that he was ruled out again on 2 December. But here we are, still engaged in the dance that Australia’s selectors have been doing through a reluctance to part with Khawaja at the top of the order. From here, other results will decide whether we have reached the end of what has been, like so many others, a very good Test career that declined irreversibly toward its end. For two years Khawaja has struggled with the level of fast bowling that Test openers must combat, looking increasingly out of sorts in the process. Throughout that period, thanks to the faith shown in him by selectors, the solution has remained in his own two hands. One big score, one vigil of the sort he once made routine, and he could lock in the confidence that his later-stage version could bring the benefit of experience with no trade-off in reflexes. That hasn’t happened, and now his fate is someone else’s to determine. Normally the injured player just has the conundrum of watching their one replacement: wanting that substitute to do well enough that the team isn’t disadvantaged, but not well enough to keep the spot. This time, though, Khawaja’s future rests in two pairs of other hands. Of course, Australian team management has still not confirmed that Travis Head will open the batting in Queensland: they prefer a situationship vibe, never wanting to commit to describing the thing in front of them. But without addition to the squad, the answer has to lie within. Most likely, that means Head reprising his star turn at the top of the order, with either Beau Webster or Josh Inglis coming into the middle, perhaps at No 6 as Cameron Green goes up to No 5. Which means that for Khawaja’s spot to disappear for the rest of the series, both those players have to do well. Head surely won’t attack as aggressively as during his Perth century, but his approach can still be boom and bust. If it’s bust, Khawaja has a case to return. If the middle order replacement doesn’t score, there’s a case to move Head back down. But if both go well, making it twice in a row for Head up top, Khawaja will struggle to mount an argument to depose him. Right now Australia are saying Khawaja is still in the plan, staying with the squad in Brisbane for his treatment. If he can storm back to have a decisive influence in the final three Tests, it would be a wonderful story to round out a career that has already given us several. But there’s a point at which Khawaja becomes Homer Simpson’s giant sandwich, and the team clinging on for too long faces a health hazard. Currently, nobody else knows what they are doing because the injured opener is the variable. Head doesn’t know if he has that job for a season or a week. Inglis won’t know if he’s coming in with licence to attack the series over four Tests, or needing a huge score from one. The argument for keeping Khawaja around since David Warner’s retirement has been stability, but right now he is the main destabilising influence on this team. That’s further underlined by his recent potshot at Perth Stadium: having faced all of six balls after dropping down to No 4 with his back problem, he felt qualified to pronounce the pitch “a piece of shit”, despite the match referee giving it the highest rating for quality. That kind of response only comes across as churlish at having made no runs on the opening day in Perth for the last two seasons, both times facing fine spells of fast bowling. A player’s job is to focus on what they should do to meet the challenge in front of them, not to complain about the one just past. Being distracted in that way, airing grievances, being seen as making excuses, all of that looks like flailing. Flailing is what happens in final moments, anything for a handhold, a symptom when desperation combines with denial. The Sixth Sense is about a guy walking around without knowing that he’s dead yet. He might not be the only one."
sport_blog_2025_dec_05_leau-du-sud-history-tingle-creek-dan-skelton-talking-horses-horse-racing.txt,sport,2025-12-05,Greg Wood,L’Eau Du Sud bids to create history in Tingle Creek for title leader Skelton,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/dec/05/leau-du-sud-history-tingle-creek-dan-skelton-talking-horses-horse-racing,"After his Crisp-like capitulation around the Elbow in the last two National Hunt trainers’ championships, Dan Skelton has set off at an even faster pace in this season’s title race and has already amassed more than £1.7m in prize money, nearly £1m ahead of second-placed Olly Murphy. The tally that is likely to matter most in April 2026, of course, will belong to Willie Mullins, who has shown that quality matters more than quantity by winning the last two titles with big hauls at the spring festivals, despite an overall aggregate winner-count of 300-66 in Skelton’s favour. But in that respect too there is encouragement for Skelton, who saddled 20 fewer winners in from May to the end of November than in the 2024-25 campaign, but upped his prize money total by nearly £450,000 year-on-year. It is a step up in terms of quality that may be further underscored at Sandown on Saturday when Skelton’s L’Eau Du Sud lines up for the Grade One Tingle Creek Chase against two top-class rivals in Mullins’s Il Etait Temps and Nicky Henderson’s popular and consistent Jonbon, the winner for the past two seasons. The Tingle Creek is the last of four big feature chases on consecutive Saturdays in November and December after the Paddy Power Gold Cup, the Betfair Chase and the Coral Gold Cup, and Skelton will be the first trainer ever to win all four in the same season if L’Eau Du Sud is first home on Saturday. And while statistical nit-pickers might point out that the Betfair Chase dates back only as far as 2005, the Tingle Creek is the next-youngest on the list having been first run in 1969. Skelton would be the first trainer to complete the Paddy Power/Coral/Tingle Creek treble, too. A win for L’Eau Du Sud might also be a useful nerve-stiffener for his trainer, as Il Etait Temps has the potential to be among Mullins’s biggest money-earners this season. The Flat season was already up and running when the seven-year-old returned from a 359-day absence in the Grade One Celebration Chase over Saturday’s track and trip in late April, and so Il Etait Temps’s impressive five-and-a-half length defeat of Jonbon did not, perhaps, receive quite the attention it deserved. It was every inch a Grade One performance, though, and backed up by an excellent time, and while Jonbon was much further behind L’Eau Du Sud in the Shloer Chase at Cheltenham last time, better ground could well see Nicky Henderson’s runner improve significantly for the run. With the major contenders all priced up between 10-11 and 4-1, this is a three-way go for the Tingle Creek that summons memories of the match-up between Moscow Flyer, Azertyuiop and Well Chief in this race in 2004. All three principals are Grade One winners over course and distance and while the nine-year-old Jonbon may struggle to reverse his recent form with Il Etait Temps and L’Eau Du Sud, there is very little between the latter pair on ratings, form or the pick of their time-figures. As a result, the bet at the prices in a race to savour is surely L’Eau Du Sud (3.00) at around 5-2. He won as he pleased at Cheltenham last time but still posted a very strong time in the conditions, and while he may not have as much scope for improvement in fitness terms as his main rivals, a repeat of his latest form could well be enough. Sandown 1.20 A 7lb for a second successive win looks generous for Turndlightsdownlow and is largely offset by Freddie Keighley’s claim. Sandown 1.50 Four exciting novice chase prospects for the card’s first Grade One and none more so than the four-year-old Lulamba, last year’s Triumph Hurdle runner-up. Aintree 2.05 Edelak, a product of the Aga Khan’s breeding operation, did enough on the Flat for Johnny Murtagh to suggest he will be an interesting recruit to juvenile hurdling. Sandown 2.25 Track specialist Go Dante is just 1lb higher than for the first of his two Imperial Cup victories. Aintree 2.40 It is still early days for White Rhino as a chaser and his return to action over the National fences in the Grand Sefton was a non-event after he was hampered at the third. The step up in trip will suit and he has been dropped 4lb since. Aintree 3.15 The form of Rambo T’s Chepstow win in October has been franked by two next-time winners from the first four home. Sandown 3.35 The strong-travelling Tanganyika has the right profile to give Venetia Williams a second win in this race in four years."
sport_blog_2025_nov_29_aflw-grand-final-north-melbourne-kangaroos-brisbane-lions.txt,sport,2025-11-29,Sarah Guiney,Kangaroos stare down brave Lions to prove even the loftiest AFLW dreams can come true,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/nov/29/aflw-grand-final-north-melbourne-kangaroos-brisbane-lions,"A foregone conclusion, it was said. North Melbourne had already done the impossible. They’d won last year’s flag after an undefeated season, and then followed it up with an astonishing second season of the same in 2025. On paper, a gaping chasm seemed to separate them from the rest of the competition. They were untouchable, unbeatable, and going back-to-back was the only possible outcome. A foregone conclusion, it was said, yet nothing foregone looks like this: close calls and genuine scares, performances as flawed as they are successful. Each game, every moment, another question demanding they scrape and claw their way to an answer. This grand final was no different. For the third time in as many years, their opponent was the juggernaut that is the Brisbane Lions – a team blooded by a monstrous seven grand final appearances in the 10-season span of this competition. The Brisbane strategy was sound, too. Melbourne had provided something of a blueprint in last week’s near win, and Brisbane followed it to the letter, getting an early jump on the Kangaroos and not allowing them to settle into their game. They played the ball hard, laying the body on the line with abandon. Their bumps were bruising, their tackles punitive, and there was a ferocious desperation to their every move. The dreams Brisbane harboured were of glory. They came to slay the dragon, and they were ready for a fight. Nothing about the result felt predetermined. In fact, it was all North Melbourne could do to weather the onslaught, and if Brisbane had been able to convert on more forward entries in the early going, perhaps the scoreboard would have reflected something far different. But playing such an aggressive, high-pressure game comes at a cost. Anything short of flawless execution grants your opponent an opening, and this North outfit needs a door only slightly ajar. For every Brisbane stumble, they were there to capitalise, opportunistic and accurate and devastating. And when Shannon Campbell gave away an undisciplined 100m penalty in the second term, walking North inside 50 to gift them a goal, it seemed to settle like a rock in the pits of Brisbane’s stomachs. Because the truth about champion teams, the inevitability that all contenders must grasp, is that they never run short of players to step up. Have a plan to cover one, a way to neutralise another, but someone else will appear and seize the game by the reins. It is not a question of if, but rather who and when. And make no mistake, North Melbourne are a champion team. They ought to be household names at this point. Kearney. Randall. Riddell. Garner. It’s hard to believe that they all belong to the same side at the same moment in time, and hearing the names in succession when they connect on a play is eye-watering stuff. Ash Riddell alone has broken disposal records so many times now it barely registers for the stunning achievement it is. And then, there’s the newcomers. Eilish Sheerin in her first grand final, rising to the occasion like a seasoned veteran in her best-on-ground turn. Eliza Shannon, last year’s unlucky exclusion, somehow stood out in a defensive structure that is famously uniform and impermeable. In the end, North ran away with it at a sold-out Ikon Park, beating the Lions by 40 points to complete a perfect season and become the first AFLW team to win back-to-back premierships. Their killer instinct does not have an off switch, and they struck blow after devastating blow, long after the game had already been won. The 9.2 (56) to 2.4 (16) scoreline seems almost a mockery of the fierce early struggle that played out, undermining both Brisbane’s valiant attempt and North’s steely eyed demeanour in equal measure. It’s the end of the trilogy, a best of three settled at long last, and yet it’s difficult to imagine either of these teams relenting next year. If there is another repeat, perhaps the game will be staged at a venue far more befitting of such a ferocious clash of titans. It would be a shame to look back at this period of unflinching dominance and wonder why the league could not echo North Melbourne’s ambition with their own logistic decisions; why they could not dare to stand on the shoulders of giants, take a swing at a larger ground, and simply go about the business of filling it. For now, that ambition belongs only to this historic, jubilant North Melbourne side, and to all who dare oppose them. “Not done yet,” their banner proudly proclaimed, and in the wake of this victory, it rings out as promise and threat both. They’re not yet done showing us what’s possible, but they also remind us that when all is said and done, this team might well be the best to ever do it. There is no shame in falling short when trying to scale such lofty, staggering heights. What matters, then, is the attempt. It matters that more teams aspire to it, just as North did. The most successful program in AFLW history started out with a dream, followed by years of investment, recruitment, and excruciating work. To slay the dragon, you need only the audacity to start."
sport_live_2025_dec_03_rugby-world-cup-2027-draw-live.txt,sport,2025-12-03,Angus Fontaine,Rugby World Cup 2027 draw: Australia and New Zealand drawn in Pool A – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/dec/03/rugby-world-cup-2027-draw-live,"Joe Schmidt is confirming that there’ll be no ongoing role for him with Australian rugby after his contract runs its term in mid-2026 and there’ll be no fourth World Cup for him in 2027. Instead he’ll happily hand over the Wallabies to Queensland Reds boss Les Kiss, his former right-hand man during Ireland’s glory days “and we’ll be in contact anyway.” I’ll be in the stadium watching. Rugby World Cups are special. The atmosphere builds into a crescendo on match days. I’m excited it’s only two years away… and in some other ways I can’t wait to not be involved because it’s pretty nerve-wracking! That’s it for tonight’s 2027 World Cup draw, folks. Thanks for your texts and emails and good luck plotting a path to the final for your team! England rugby fans, are we happy? Although it will be his former protege at Ireland, Les Kiss, who will lead Australia’s 2027 campaign, current Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt has seen the same “clumps” of ancient enemies I have and is excited by the challenge ahead… “Wales v England, Ireland v Scotland… there are a lot of match-ups of teams that know each other really well and play each other often. (New Zealand) will be looking at Australia and thinking, ‘We know what we’re up against’. It’s a Trans-Tasman battle and I think both teams are going to love it.” That’s it, folks. Hometown derbies galore! Wallabies and All Blacks to face off in Pool A, Scotland v Ireland in Pool D and England v Wales in Pool F. Searching for their fourth title, defending champions South Africa get the rails run to the Round of 16 against minnows Romania, Georgia and Italy. Stand by for Joe Schmidt and Harry Wilson who will assess the threats posed by Hong Kong China, Chile and New Zealand. David Campese has refreshed my glass and reminded me that the Wallabies have done it to their trans-Tasman rivals before at a World Cup. Here it is in slow-mo. Pure poetry! Finally, World Rugby chief Brett Robinson does the duties for Band 1. Pool F: Zimbabwe, Tonga, Wales, England Pool E: Samoa, USA, Japan, France Pool D: Portugal, Uruguay, Scotland, Ireland Pool C: Canada, Spain, Fiji, Argentina Pool B: Romania, Georgia, Italy, South Africa Pool A: Australia, Hong Kong China, Chile, New Zealand Wallabies legend James Slipper has Band 3 and here’s how the numbers fall… Pool F: Zimbabwe, Tonga, Wales Pool E: Samoa, USA, Japan Pool D: Portugal, Uruguay, Scotland Pool C: Canada, Spain, Fiji Pool B: Romania, Georgia, Italy Pool A: Australia, Hong Kong China, Chile Alicia will draw Band 3 and allot them into Pools. Here we go… Pool F: Zimbabwe, Tonga Pool E: Samoa, USA Pool D: Portugal, Uruaguay Pool C: Canada, Spain Pool B: Romania, Georgia Pool A: Australia, Hong Kong China, Chile Here we go. Scruitneers from BDO are on hand to check there are no illegalities and it will be Dan Carter who will draw the first teams from Band 4 for each of the six pools… Pool F: Zimbabwe Pool E: Samoa. Pool D: Portugal Pool C: Canada Pool B: Romania Pool A: Hong Kong China Colm from Dublin and Sasha from Subiaco via Auckland agree that ‘World In Union’ will be hard to beat as a Cup anthem but Dan B of No Fixed Address has suggested this track from Australian punks Amyl &amp; the Sniffers as an anthem for the RWC2027 draw tonight. I’m a bit offended, Dan. Was my description of the new format that confusing? Or have I had one too many of Frank Bunce’s Wallbangers? Our panellists are installed behind big red buckets. What will they pluck from within them? And whose destiny will be decided by their fickle fingers of fate? All Black legend Dan Carter recalls seeing the first RWC as a seven-year-old and going on to play in four tournaments. Mr Carter certainly made the most of every moment on the World Cup stage… Much has been said in the preliminaries so far but diddly squat has been decided. Instead former Wallaby flanker Phil Waugh, who tasted defeat in the 2003 World Cup final, and who is now the CEO of Rugby Australia says tonight lifts the curtain on “a very exciting time for Australian rugby. It’d be great to see the team go deep in the tournament and we have plenty of reasons to be excited.” Here are some highlights of that 2003 decider (or lowlights if you’re an Aussie). Jack from Maitland has emailed to ask whether RWC2027 has a theme song like the 1991 World Cup anthem by Dame Kiri Te Kanawa? Good question, Jack. I suggest Rugby Australia mend a burned bridge from 2022 and reach out to former coach Dave Rennie whose talent for strumming an acoustic guitar inspired a Wallabies streak of five wins in 2018 – their best run since 2008 – and a run of victories the 2026 Wallabies would blow up a panda farm to achieve. Tonight’s draw will allocate the lower-ranked teams first and be conducted in band order starting with Band 4, followed by Band 3, then Band 2, and concluding with Band 1. For each band, the allocation of teams to pools will follow this sequence: First team drawn: Pool F Second team drawn: Pool E Third team drawn: Pool D Fourth team drawn: Pool C Fifth team drawn: Pool B Sixth team drawn: Pool A The draw is random except for one feature: Australia are locked into Pool A as host nation and will therefore contest the opening game at Optus Stadium in Perth on 1 October 2027. Who from Band 1 will be drawn and placed in Pool A to meet them? The remaining team balls will be placed into four separate bowls, each representing one of the four bands. The Draw presenters will then draw the balls from these bowls. Ealesy has a similar set-up on the buffet tonight, four bowls of snacks, each a deadly rival of the other: Bowl 1: Chicken Twisties Bowl 2: Arancini balls Bowl 3: Prawns Bowl 4: M&amp;Ms We are readying for action in Sydney. Before we dive into the pools let’s look at the “bands” each of the 24 nations has been seeded in according to the IRB world rankings locked in last weekend. BAND #1 (ranked 1-6): South Africa, New Zealand, England, Ireland, France, Argentina. The big mover in Band One is England, whose 11-match winning streak has seen them climb from seventh to third in the rankings this year. BAND #2 (ranked 7-12): Australia, Fiji, Scotland, Italy, Wales, Japan. Band Two’s big name here is two-time World Cup winner Australia whose winless recent tour of Europe has condemned them to seventh spot. BAND #3 (ranked 13-18): Georgia, Uruguay, Spain, United States, Chile, Tonga. The fast-improving world No 16 United States will host the 2031 men’s tournament (and also the 2033 women’s RWC) and need a breakout tournament here. Will the Round of 16 provide it? BAND #4 (ranked 19-24): Samoa, Portugal, Romania, Hong Kong, Zimbabwe, Canada Samoa have played at every World Cup since 1991 but are still miffed about missing the first in 1987. They claim they were “not invited”. Luke McLaughlin ran the rule over the 24 teams and identified some juicy rivalries and sub-plots that may eventuate tonight… An expanded World Cup means a longer schedule, no? No! RWC2027 will actually take place over 43 days compared to 50 in 2023. Games will be spread across seven cities: Adelaide/ Tarntanya, Brisbane/ Meeanjin, Melbourne/ Narrm, Newcastle/ Awabakal-Worimi, Perth/ Boorloo, Sydney/ Gadigal and Townsville/ Gurambilbarra. But more teams means more matches, yes? Yes! Instead of 48 games like at the last Men’s Rugby World Cup in France, the 2027 tournament will have 52. But it’s more games for fans NOT players. The change from five teams per pool to four means one fewer match for each team in the pool stage. So despite adding four extra teams, the pool stage is shorter because the new Round of 16 runs longer. More knockout rounds but less knockouts (hopefully). With the rising spectre of CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy), player welfare will be front and centre at RWC2027 and all teams will observe a minimum five rest days between matches. “This format ensures maximum jeopardy, drama and excitement for the teams as well as spectators, while not compromising on the health of those who play the game,” says World Rugby. Given the expanded competition, there’s also a new format in 2027. Previously, rugby’s top 20 teams were divided into four pools of five. After playing everyone in their pool, the top two teams from each pool progressed to the quarter-finals. In 2027, the top two teams from each of the six pools progress as before… BUT there they will be joined by the four best third-placed teams, progressing based on competition points (or, if that can’t split them, points difference… and failing that, try difference). It makes the new “Round of 16” the World Cup’s first knockout games. “The introduction of a Round of 16 will deliver even more knockout rugby, ensuring every match counts and every team has the chance to make history,” World Rugby reckons. “This is a huge step forward for rugby and a reflection of the game’s global growth.” But the host nation has a welcome edge, as Jack Snape explains… Hang on, 24 teams? You heard right. All those proclamations about RWC2027 being “the biggest tournament yet” are actually based in cold fact rather than hot air. Since the 2003 jamboree, we have had 20 teams in World Cup competition. But in 2027 we have four more! First are the 12 teams that finished top three of their pools at Rugby World Cup 2023 in France and automatically qualified for 2027: France, New Zealand, Italy, Ireland, South Africa, Scotland, Wales, Fiji, Australia, England, Argentina and Japan. The other 12 places are teams that qualified via regional tournaments, including the Rugby Europe Championship and Rugby Africa Cup: Georgia, Spain, Romania, Portugal, Tonga, Canada, United States, Uruguay, Chile, Samoa, Zimbabwe and Hong Kong China. Each pool tonight will get a mix of rugby’s “big fish” and “minnows”. (A bit like the BBQ tonight where Mark Ella stuffed a barramundi he caught up north with the baby mullet Joe Roff netted from the Tweed River to make “Mullamundi.” Sublime!) Hong Kong China are the Cinderella story, playing in their first-ever World Cup. But Zimbabwe have also qualified for their first RWC since 1991. Here’s how the Sables punched their ticket to RWC2027… With the official draw at 8pm AEST, here’s how tonight will work… We have 24 teams in the draw and four presenters to sift them into six pools with four teams in each. Our presenters are… World Rugby Chair and former Australian international Brett Robinson All Blacks legend and two-time RWC winner Dan Carter Former Wallabies captain and Australia’s most-capped player James Slipper Olympic gold medallist and former Australian Sevens star Alicia Lucas After the draw we will get a live reaction to Australia’s pool and its rivals from Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt and captain Harry Wilson. The Draw is being broadcast live on Stan Sport, 9Gem and 9Now in Australia and streamed globally via RugbyPass TV and World Rugby YouTube and former Wallaby Morgan Turinui will be leading the pre-show punditry and post-draw analysis. Morgs brought some devils on horseback tonight that were delicious. Greetings sports fans! Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the 2027 Men’s Rugby World Cup draw. Angus Fontaine here hosting the action from the host nation of Australia where I am in turn being hosted by the Wallabies 1999 World Cup-winning captain, John Eales at a VIP Gala RWC Draw Shindig at his beachside penthouse in Sydney. Seriously, the big fella has really pushed the boat out this year and the room is as full as Will Skelton’s socks with rugby union royalty. Jonny Wilkinson’s handmade sausage rolls are going down a storm, Serge Blanco has the white wine flowing and, with Francois Pienaar on the decks, David Campese is already goose-stepping on the dance floor. But in a few moments, the music will stop. Ealesy will switch on his 99” plasma TV and we’ll all settle in to find out which rugby titans will clash in the pool stages of RWC#11 kicking off on 1 October 2027. For the 24 teams it means 95 weeks to sift personnel, get fit, crunch data, form strategies and prime themselves for rugby’s pinnacle event. For fans, tonight is an opportunity to light a very long and very slow fuse on 668 nights of daring to dream that when the final whistle blows at the old Sydney Olympic Stadium on 13 November, it’s your team’s captain holding the Webb Ellis Trophy aloft as men’s world champions. So fill your flasks, grab a pie, walk 10 paces and get ready to… DRAW!"
sport_live_2025_dec_04_australia-vs-england-live-ashes-second-2nd-test-day-one-aus-v-eng-cricket-scores-updates-gabba-brisbane.txt,sport,2025-12-04,Martin Pegan (earlier) and Tanya Aldred (later),"Australia v England: Ashes second Test, day one – as it happened",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/dec/04/australia-vs-england-live-ashes-second-2nd-test-day-one-aus-v-eng-cricket-scores-updates-gabba-brisbane,"Simon Burnton on Zak Crawley And that’s day one done and dusted. England go into Friday on top, runs in the bag and the last wicket stand aflame. Joe Root has his deserved and long-awaited hundred in Australia. and the rest of us have the promise of a Test match going into a third day. Should be fun! Thanks for all your emails, apologies that I wasn’t able to get to so many of them. We’ll be back tomorrow – do join us. Bye! Many messages to celebrate England’s greatest batsman. A handful below. Ram Sridhar“ I am so happy for Root. Last Fortress seized with a gleaming feather on his ostentatious cap of centuries. I dare say that Aus have let England get away on Day 1. Not gonna jinx any further Will Juba: “Rooooooooooooooooot! That albatross has finally taken flight. So pleased for him!” Tom Wellman. “Might be an idea for the other English batsman to look at Root and think ‘hhhmm, that works’. Just an idea.” Zac Crawley now with the mic, head shaved. “I was trying to keep it simple, happy with my knock, gutted to get out when I did, the pitch just starting to get flatter. It would have felt a long break between Tests even if I’d got two hundreds, I had a clear plan and I stuck to it. There were still a couple of loose shots in there, as I tend to do. I was trying to score on the leg side, trying to leave a bit better outside off. They shaved the wicket this morning and good to bat on.” Was there talk of a declaration towards the end? “No. The boys went hard, and if they got out it was a win-win situation.” A larger than life Matthew Hayden, relieved that he doesn’t now have to walk naked round the MCG after a bet with Greg Blewett over whether or not Root would score a hundred this series. “A magnificent day. Root looked great, he kept the ball really close under his eyes, it sets England up, Root up, and puts Australia on the back foot in this Test match.” “All us old fogies did not like to see Australia without a spinner and the slow over rate too.” And OBO favourite Tim de Lisle drops a nugget in my inbox. “England have already batted for more overs at the Gabba (74) than they did in the whole game in Perth (67.3). Proper creekit!” Michael Vaughan has stopped an exhausted Mitchell Starc. How does it feel to have more wickets than Wasim? “Fine, Wasim is still the pinnacle left armer, I think he’s still better.” What is your relationship with the pink ball? “ It is what it is, I think it is like a white ball, a bit soft today… Joe batted well there. A tough day’s cricket not the easiest to score or bowl with. A pretty solid day’s Test cricket.” 74th over: England 325-9 (Root 135, Archer 32) Neser with the final over. Labuschagne chews his knuckle. Stokes laughs in the stands. Archer plays out the last ball and Root leads the players off, pulling off his helmet and waving it round the ground. A century in Australia his at last. After an up and down day – I think that’s advantage England. 73rd over: England 322-9 (Root 133, Archer 31) Starc now with the pure business of taking wickets. He looks a little weary as he trudges back to his mark. Archer picks up an easy run to reach his best Test score of 31. Five minutes left in the day, and Root steals the strike for the final over of the day. 72nd over: England 316-9 (Root 129, Archer 29) Archer is swinging for England, but so far evading the fielders. Now Root happily reverse-swings/sweeps Boland for six, as Neser leaps high and over the rope to try and catch it. And the clock has now ticked sufficiently that AUSTRALIA WILL NOT HAVE TO BAT TONIGHT. “Thrilling stuff this rearguard blitz from Archer,” writes Duncan Harte. “A quick update for any OBO readers who caught your post at O8:17 GMT: “Dreams do comes true! Joe Root scores his first ton on Australian soil the same day our humble Gabbattoir project goes viral. https://gabbattoir.com/ Thanks to Tanya’s shout out, numbers have surged. We’re approaching 200 players and there are now dozens of player groups. Many thanks to everyone who has signed up - welcome aboard. Predictions will open for tomorrow’s play at stumps today. Then we’ll find out if the server explodes…” 71st over: England 307-9 (Root 122, Archer 27) Mitchell-who? Archer slams Starc’s first ball for six. Root his third ball for four. More runs, slightly chaotic end of the day this for Australia. 70th over: England 288-9 (Root 113, Archer 17) Archer makes the absolute most of these Australian tactics and the ticking clock, smiting six off a short ball from Boland, a couple of twos and then four more through deep mid-wicket. And now Root lets loose – a tidy pick up for four: 19 from the over. “Come on!” roars a watching Stokes. Hello Richard Williams, “I’m sat watching a dodgy stream that’s giving me the Australian coverage, where they’ve mentioned that no team has lost a day night test having scored 260+ runs batting first. What odds on England achieving this rather unwanted record?” (literally as I’m writing this message Atkinson has just gone) 69th over: England 272-9 (Root 113, Archer 1) Root plays a reverse-scoop to Starc and they take a single, Archer drives. Smith changes the field a little bit here, a little bit there, and why wouldn’t you. In the stands, Jamie Smith is already in his keeping gear. An Australian twelfth man slow-runs out a helmet for Travis Head at short leg. “Morning Tanya,” Morning Jordi Fens! “This series is the first I’ve experienced as a shift worker. The disappointingly early finish to the first test meant my coinciding night shifts were instead spent dodging Christmas songs on various radio stations. “This D/N test poses different challenges: slogging through the lion’s share of the night shift with no cricket to distract and knowing that at some point soon I’ll have to turn in and sleep through what may well be an exciting end to the final session. “Today’s test got off to an inauspicious start when I had to break off from the national anthems to give someone an early wake up call. Getting back to the car to hear England were already 13 for 2 barely a quarter of an hour in, swelled my disappointment. However, a tumultuous at times fight back has fostered my faith that this just may be England’s series. “Here’s to tonight’s final night shift for my team, and finger’s crossed tomorrow’s first session is marked by Root and piling on the runs or perhaps another Stokes five for.” Good luck to you all, and all those on the night shift. 68th over: England 269-9 (Root 111, Archer 0) What are Root’s tactics here? If the last wicket fell now, England would get 25 minutes to bowl at Australia. While I’m thinking about it, he cuts four on the back bend. Ah, here comes Matthew Potts with instructions from the dressing-room. Sharp ears and eyes from the magnificently named Mojo Wellington. “Pedant’s corner: although not so much of a pedant as I didn’t pay enough attention to note the stat in detail, but pretty sure TMS commentary said it was the first run out of an England captain in an Ashes Test since 1975 (Tony Greig, I think). Ted Dexter’s was the last one in Australia before Stokes.” Thank you! 67th over: England 264-9 (Root 106, Archer 0) Six wickets for Starc, four ducks for England. A cunning plan for Archer to have some overs under lights? Pitched up and Carse fends forward like an old man shaking his walking stick at the sea, and Carey takes smartly behind him. Atkinson hooks, and Carey and Labuschange sprint back separately but in unison, each seemingly oblivious to the other. Carey holds on, somehow, on the stretch, as Labuschagne crashes into him. A replay to check if the ball has touched the spidercam cable – but it hasn’t. And another five-fer for Starc. 66th over: England 258-7 (Root 106, Atkinson 0) Through the grill of Root’s helmet, his blue eyes gleam. He defends the first ball from Boland, Carey reaching round the stumps to try and pick up the bounce off his thigh pad. Boland’s second is a bouncer taken with immense skill and energy by Carey. Called wide. And now he has it, sashayed round the corner and to the rope. He raises both hands, grins, kisses the badge of his helmet, and raises his bat round the ground. A standing ovations from the ground, the England balcony – a box ticked on a magnificent career, at last. Four more into the leg side to finish the over. And with his first hundred on Australian soil, he moves to fourth on the all-time list of Test centurions, with 40, behind only Ponting, Kallis and Tendulkar. 65th over: England 251-7 (Root 98, Atkinson 0) Aha! Smith brings Starc back. Root takes a single from the second ball to a rumble of “ROOOOOT” from the English section of the crowd. Jacks has a wild swing at a wide and becoming wider ball from Starc. And does it terminally again. “Evening Tanya,” hello Phil Withall. “The Gabba is a transport vacuum, it has a bus station but is surrounded by major arterial roads out of the city that make it a horrible experience to get away from. Maybe take the fine for the slow over rate and speed up the transport infrastructure upgrades planned for the Olympics....Rant over, good night.” Drives at a wide one from Starc, after he’d driven and missed at a wide one the ball before. Smith at second slip watches the ball from bat to palm. And all after he’d played so damn fine. 64th over: England 250-6 (Root 97, Jacks 19) Weatherald’s silver hoop earrings jingle as he gobs on the dirt. A Jacks single puts Root on strike with two balls of Green’s over to reach his milestone. The first slides past his outside edge. He cuts the second and tries to come back for a never-there second until Jacks sends him flailing back. 63rd over: England 248-6 (Root 96, Jacks 18) Doggett starts the final mini-session with a friendly long hop and Jacks, easy-peasy, pulls him to the rope. Next to me on the sofa, the dog yawns. And now Root joins in – pulling finely and into the nineties – and passing highest Test score on Australian soil. And another! He’s just four away now. An email, from Darryl Accone in Jo’burg. Greetings, Tanya. “Given Usman Khawaja’s troubles surely it’s time the Australian selectors put aside their animus towards Cameron Bancroft and pick him to open. He had an excellent season last year but was passed over, including for Sam Konstas, who proved essentially a one-trick pony, his debut knock of 60 or so. Bancroft has gone off the boil but is as good as any of the other candidates for the job. “As a South African, it seems to me that although Warner and Smith were forgiven for Sandpapergate and rehabilitated by the establishment, Bancroft has been scapegoated -- not for “applying” sandpaper to the ball but for being discovered doing so. It’s a cowardly revenge by cricket in Australia/ Cricket Australia on someone who was coerced into cheating by a senior player and inveterate reprobate: Warner. Justice and selection common sense should prevail.” 62nd over: England 235-6 (Root 88, Jacks 13) A Green maiden ends the first half of this final session, and they take DRINKS And a huge thank you to Tom Collins for TMS overseas link instructions. See below: ”Please tell Irish viewers that you can access TMS by: Downloading Cricket Australia Live App to phone, Clicking into the Match on the Home page, Clicking into Cricket Radio, Navigating to BBC Sport, Selecting Real-time, Bob’s your uncle Awkward, but it can be done.” 61st over: England 235-6 (Root 88, Jacks 13) Another one of those gorgeous Root back bending cuts off Doggett, from a delivery that turns out to be a no-ball. And four more for Jacks who, with immaculate timing, cuts Doggett through midwicket. Carefully rebuilding here from these two. Trivia fans: Stokes’s dismissal was the first time for more than 50 years that an England captain has been run out against Australia. That man was Ted Dexter in 1962-3, at the MCG. With thanks to TMS “Given that there’s no issue with light, why can’t they play until the overs are finished?” asks Andy Flintoff. I’m guessing that there are city regulations/public transport issues? 60th over: England 227-6 (Root 85, Jacks 9) A Jacks off-drive beats Head to the rope – rather lovely stroke actually. Green, who has looked rather toothless, replaces Boland. “Good to see Root batting so well and protecting the tail,” writes Andrew Moreman. Yes, he’s fully in the zone here. 59th over: England 218-6 (Root 82, Jacks 3). Jacks flashes at Doggett’s first ball in a way that’s isn’t entirely reassuring. Shakes himself down and goes again. Clips another couple of runs. And we are into the final hour. Morning, Tom v d Gucht: “I’d been watching the Aussie selections with interest and trepidation. I thought the ageing pool of talent they were picking from would weaken their team. “However, I then remembered in a cold swear how Australia have a history of unearthing well-honed and nuggety warriors as well as swashbuckling all-rounders who I had written off as either journeymen, cheap knock-offs of all-time greats or bits-and-pieces players only for them to break my heart when they turn up and rub our face in the dust having perfected their craft after years of Sheffield Shield cricket and County stints- arriving fully formed and ready to do the job expected of them... Stuart Clark... Chris Rogers... Haddin...Symonds... Watson... Marsh... Possibly Nesser and Inglis too.. “ 58th over: England 216-6 (Root 82, Jacks 1) Boland wipes the sweat from his brow, Jacks checks over one shoulder, waits, bat aloft. We cut to the Australian dressing room where Cummins, in a back to front baseball cap, is studying a replay. Jacks is off the mark with a confident clip . 57th over: England 215-6 (Root 82, Jacks 0) Some good news for England – Australia’s over rate has been so sluggish that England won’t have to face the new ball tonight. A Root boundary to settle the stomach, leaning back to Doggett and gliding the ball through point. 56th over: England 211-6 (Root 77, Jacks 0) A pretty calamitous five minutes that for England – courtesy of a pin-point throw and a brilliant ball. Jacks – Test-match-less since 2022 – enters the lions’ den. Survives his first three balls from Boland, the third skimming past the inside edge. A mango, a peach, shimmies through the gate, jiggling off the seam, and Daddles accompanies Smith back to the dressing room. No! No! Stokes sets off for a run that wasn’t, Root isn’t coming, Stokes executes a three-point turn and hares back but a fabulous throw by Inglis, on the move, aiming at one stump, spells his downfall. 55th over: England 210-4 (Root 77, Smith 0) 54th over: England 210-4 (Root 77, Stokes 19) Australia pull the field in, Carey stands up to Boland. Root taps his bat, pat, pat, on the hard Brisbane ground and at last there’s something to get his teeth into – a fuller ball from Boland is driven with heavenly skill past the stumps and down the ground for four. So many emails, I’ll try to catch them all. But for now, does anyone have the overseas TMS link for Michael Keane’s dad? ”My poor old Dad got back to Ireland yesterday having spent the last 2 weeks helping me recover from surgery and of course he’s immediately struck down in bed with lurgy. TMS would cheer him up no end.” 53rd over: England 206-4 (Root 73, Stokes 19) Another maiden from Neser. The tension builds. “ Hi Tanya, it’s 12:45am here in San Diego,” writes Michael Fryer. “My 5-year old daughter has a stomach bug and asked to have a bath to ease the discomfort. The only bright spot in all this has been the chance to follow some of the action I normally miss. When I went to bed we were 89/2. I’ve been delighted that England’s batting has been in better shape than my poor daughter’s tummy!” Get well soon Michael’s daughter! Max Rushden has been biting his lip in a hipster Fitzroy north coffee shop.. 52nd over: England 206-4 (Root 73, Stokes 19) England have seen Starc off – at least for now. Boland replaces him and England now have right arm medium from both ends. That’s what county cricket prep is for. Boland hits Root’s front pad. He’s very far forward, but Smith is eager/desperate and goes for the review. And loses it, Root was way outside the line. 51st over: England 204-4 (Root 71, Stokes 19) A quick single the only reward from a Neser over. From the Gabba, Shinyi sends a beautiful picture of the Brisbane moon, rising above the stands and a crane. 50th over: England 203-4 (Root 70, Stokes 19) A gorgeous Stokes off drive for four, bat face open for autographs, off the first ball of Starc’s over brings up the England 200. Later in the over, Stokes swishes and misses. Without wanting to delve into fan fiction, Stokes and Starc and Root are glistening with sweat here, their skin luminescent under floodlights, every angle illuminated. 49th over: England 197-4 (Root 70, Stokes 15) Neser. The stands are bursting. England anti-Bazzballing these twilight overs. A sharp single to finish. Hello there, Mike Morris! “Will Juba’s elegant message (44th over) has inspired me to write a haiku about the day’s play, it’s called “The Aussie Attack”:- A toothless array Wickets fall with abandon Mitchell bloody Starc Readers may insert a stronger epithet than “bloody” without corrupting my poetic intent.” 48th over: England 197-4 (Root 69, Stokes 14) “Tactically this session is what you set up your game for,” Haddin says. “If Stokes and Root can dig in and get through it, the rewards will be immense.” Starc paws the dirt. Runs in, puffing his cheeks, three slips lurking. A single, then Stokes must endure five balls. Starc is disgusted with the ball, and hands it to the umpire – but it still merrily goes through the magic ring. Starc can’t believe it. Head puts in his two-pennies-worth but is ignored. Harry Brook gets a pasting in the Haddin-Prior dinner-time chat. “He’s selling himself out and his team,” growls Haddin. Similar talk on TMS earlier, with Agnew saying that Brook is at risk of wasting his immense talent. I do wonder if Bazball has been the best framework for him – when I was watching Brook play for Yorkshire before he was picked for England, I don’t remember him playing with such recklessness. 47th over: England 196-4 (Root 68, Stokes 14) Neser shimmies in. Stokes lets one pass him by that whispers very close to his off stump. And another beauty sways past the outside edge. And another. Carey stalks him close up to the stumps, silken gloves and there’s another fabulous take over Stokes’s head. England have scored just five runs in the last five overs – but survived. Well played. A twenty minute break now for beans on toast/energy gels at the Gabba, and coffees all round back home. 446th over: England 196-4 (Root 67, Stokes 14) Smith and Head try to persuade the umpire to change the ball but it still fits through his pocket ball measurer, so they’re sent on their way. The TV pictures are going heavy on the stunning sunset, less on the chanting Barmy Army. You can sense Stokes’ concentration here as he lets one from Starc pass by his poised bat. Just one over before tea/dinner I think. 45th over: England 194-4 (Root 67, Stokes 13) Neser replaces Boland. Five dots balls, a wide – then the extra ball nearly does for Stokes as it sprays off the pitch and lollops up. Stokes stares and chews his lips. 44th over: England 193-4 (Root 67, Stokes 13) The pink ball shines in Starc’s hand like a giant highlighter, his arms gleaming with Brisbane sweat. He gets one to bounces nastily off the seam at Stokes. England seem to have decided to wait him out. Hello Will Juba! “A short one from me… Root: an entire cricketing nation refuses to temp fate… (Apologies in advance if I’ve just tempted fate)“ Hope that albatross is sitting comfortably on your shoulders? 43rd over: England 191-4 (Root 66, Stokes 12) Two fours from Stokes off Boland’s over – one flashily through the slips – again I’m not sure they saw it – one tickled off the pads. “If I were Alyssa Healy, I’d delete ‘Over, First’ from Mitchell Starc’s phone. But then again, I’m the jealous type. ...” Very good, Rowan Sweeney. 42nd over: England 182-4 (Root 65, Stokes 4). The sun is now a ball of flames on the horizon and the floodlights have taken over. Root steadfasts out five balls from Starc and picks up a single off the sixth. 41st over: England 181-4 (Root 64, Stokes 4) Boland ambles in – one from the over. With Brook’s wicket, Starc overtakes Wasim Akram to become the leading left-arm fast bowling wicket taker in history. A wonderful email lands, (to be entirely accurate landed before Brook was out.) Hello Duncan Harte! Greetings from Glasgow. This is all going suspiciously well at the moment. While I dream about a Root century, here’s a little something I hope could be of interest to OBO readers during the next break or at end of day… The 2017 Ashes series might bring back painful memories for most England fans, but it will always have a special place in my heart. Sitting in a London curry house with four friends a few days before the First Test in Brisbane, talk inevitably turned to the cricket. We soon found ourselves running through the classic OBO playbook: themed best XIs, club cricketing mishaps, the summer of 2005, Jaffa Cake related debate and, of course, our predictions for the upcoming series. Little did we know this idle talk would prove the start of an eight-year, delirious descent down the rabbit hole, as the five of us sought to perfect the ‘science of cricket prediction’. As we continued to send each other predictions across the series, a fiercely contested game with increasingly baroque scoring regulations gradually took shape. We became completely obsessed. Work deadlines were missed, marital harmony was tested to its limits, but life was never sweeter. We had a name for this addiction – one chosen in honour of that brutal Brisbane Test arena and the exquisite agony of watching our finely tuned predictions flounder like the England top order – “Gabbattoir”. Fast forward to 2025 and we’re now into our fifth Gabbattoir series. It’s a game we’ve previously only ever played between the five of us, but over the years, others have expressed curiosity in joining the action. And so, a few months ago, we embarked on a hare-brained scheme to turn our project into something that could be enjoyed by the wider public. Those interested can now visit https://gabbattoir.com. The principle is simple: the more accurate your daily prediction, the better your score. The reality is, you’re about to embark on a whole world of pain. You can learn more about how it all works in the ABOUT GABBATTOIR section. The thought of fellow OBO readers forming their own Groups and taking delight in this strange thing we’ve created seems almost too much to hope for. It’s been a labour of love, it’s entirely free to play and it’s inspired by our belief that test cricket really is the greatest thing we’ve managed as a species so far. We’d be over the moon if you could mention us. Done! And I’ve got an inkling you might tickle a few OBO boxes… 40th over: England 180-4 (Root 63, Stokes 4) I think we might have hit the witching hour…. Starc grins a wolfish grin as he strides giantly back to his mark. IT wasn’t a great shot from Brook – and incidentally Smith was shaking his head after taking that catch at slip – I don’t think he could see the ball. Stokes off the mark with four through the slips A flamboyant drive, an edge – and the balls flies up and into Smith’s waiting paws. Two balls into Starc’s new spell… 39th over: England 175-3 (Root 62, Brook 31) Both sides are wearing black armbands in memory of Robin Smith. Root nudges Boland off his toes to pick up a single, Brook sends his bat in flamboyant arc for another. Root is hit on the front pad from Boland’s last ball, Boland likes it, so does Smith, they review – it was in line but would have been bouncing over leg stump – and Australia lose a review. 38th over: England 172-3 (Root 61, Brook 30) Green’s previous over went for nine and Brook is eager for more. He flashes at the first two balls and doesn’t connect, but connects to the last, flaying a wide one square to the rope. It’s a shot that reminds Michael Vaughan of Kevin Pietersen. 37th over: England 166-3 (Root 61, Brook 24) Thanks Martin! Well this is looking a lot more perky than when I rolled over in bed to hear 11-2. Root is 39 away from that which should be unmentioned and Brook is full of mischief. The ground is almost completely in shadow now and the sun hovers on the brow of the sky. A maiden from Boland. 36th over: England 166-3 (Root 61, Brook 24) Cameron Green bowls the last over before drinks and Joe Root welcomes him with a punch straight drive back past the all-rounder to the rope. A full toss takes Root by surprise but he picks a gap wide of mid-off for three more runs. Brook ends the over getting away with an inside edge on to his pads as England keep their noses in front with 68 runs on the board for the loss of one wicket since tea. Thanks a lot for following along to this point. After a dramatic start to day one at the Gabba, it has strangely taken on the form of traditional Test encounter. Tanya Aldred will take the ball from here and for what I expect to be the most intriguing part of the day… and night. Enjoy! 35th over: England 157-3 (Root 52, Brook 24) Scott Boland replaces Doggett with a ray of light creeping across the striker’s end and Mitchell Starc back on the field. Cameron Green collects a defensive dab into the gully and inexplicably throws down the stumps. The England batters scamper through for a single that relieves the pressure on Root and Brook is immediately on the attack with a lofted slice to backward point for two. 34th over: England 154-3 (Root 51, Brook 22) Neser with a neat over that only concedes two runs while Australia wait for the shadow to complete their journey across the Gabba outfield. 33rd over: England 152-3 (Root 50, Brook 21) Joe Root reaches his 10th half-century on Australian soil with a single off a shorter ball. The 34-year-old is cruising along now after a shaky start and is halfway to that elusive Test ton. Mitchell Starc is off the field perhaps preparing for his third spell. 32nd over: England 147-3 (Root 48, Brook 18) Root whips Neser away from outside off and through mid-on to the boundary as the runs keep flowing for England. Australia had already gone up with a shout for lbw but Neser started his delivery wide of the crease and it was heading too far down the leg-side after hitting Root on the pads. Still enough happening even as the pink ball is now more than 30 overs old. 31st over: England 143-3 (Root 44, Brook 18) Doggett keeps digging the ball in short but is unable to truly test, let alone trouble, the England duo. Three singles in the over each coming from a controlled pull shot. 30th over: England 139-3 (Root 42, Brook 16) Sublime wicketkeeping from Alex Carey almost sends Harry Brook on his way. The keeper is up at the stumps to Neser as Brook steps forward and attempts to ramp the quick. Carey whips the bails off but Brook has only just got his foot down behind the line. Not sure if Brook gets rattled by much, but that’s a reminder to stay closer to his crease. 29th over: England 133-3 (Root 41, Brook 11) Harry Brook is off to a flyer as he takes the attack to Brendan Doggett as the Australia quick looks to test him off the back of a length. Brook clips a first boundary off his pads then steps back to slice another through point. 28th over: England 123-3 (Root 41, Brook 1) England are in command with Crawley and Root keeping the scoreboard ticking over after lunch before the opener is undone off an awkward length from Neser. That’s the local quick’s first Test wicket in almost three years. Michael Neser gets the breakthrough as Zak Crawley attempts to pull a delivery that doesn’t bounce as high as expected as a bottom edge carries to Carey who is standing back again with the gloves. 27th over: England 121-2 (Crawley 76, Root 40) Alex Carey is back in his usual position keeping from a distance to Brendan Doggett. Root wafts high at a bouncer heading down the legside and gets a tickle that takes the ball just out of a diving Carey’s left glove. Another close call for Australia but they have been unable to make the most of the fast start that Starc gave them. The runs are flowing too, with 23 put on the board in three overs since the break. 26th over: England 113-2 (Crawley 74, Root 34) Michael Neser is the next bowler to take the ball after tea when Mitchell Starc might have been expected to return after resting across the break. Crawley hammers another boundary - his 11th of the innings - as he gets on the front foot and drives straight down the ground. Alex Carey is up at the stump while Neser is bowling at about 135km/h. A lot is going right for England at the Gabba right now, but Mark Wood was speaking with Channel Seven during the tea break and conceded that he is unlikely to be available for the third Test in Adelaide as he manages a knee injury that was operated on earlier this year. 25th over: England 107-2 (Crawley 69, Root 33) Crawley picks up where he left off before tea with a pair of boundaries on either side of the wicket. The first comes off a crunching pull shot to take England past 100, then another past mid-off brings up the century stand. Zak Crawley and Joe Root return to the middle at the Gabba with England in control at 98 for two after 24 overs. The sting went out of the wicket – and perhaps the pink ball – as the afternoon session wore on, and England will hope to build on their positive start. Brendan Doggett has the ball in hand as he prepares to bowl to Root with an extra fielder now on the leg-side. A reminder that Nathan Lyon has been left out of the Australia XI for the first time in a Test on home soil since January 2013. Scott Lowe wonders if there might already be a tinge of regret among the home camp. “Curious if this is the earliest in a Test that one team has come to regret its selection? Batters are set, pitch and ball are doing nothing, and intense heat. And instead of turning to their greatest offspinner, Aus have to rotate through Starc and four (!) right-arm medium fast bowlers.” Former England batter – and batting coach – Mark Ramprakash has also considered the impact of playing parts of this Test at the Gabba under lights, while putting the onus on the tourists to “win key battles”. England mostly did that across the latter hour-and-a-half of the first session. Stuart Broad described them as a lottery but Australia’s outstanding record would suggest that actually the best team normally prevails, and skill should win the day. The question for England is whether they have it in them to dominate in relatively unfamiliar conditions, to win key battles at key moments and to take control. Zak Crawley and Joe Root have put together the sort of sensible partnership that England were lacking in their defeat in Perth. That may or may not be with a view to batting through the daylight hours and making the most of bowling under lights, or simply in response to a second-innings collapse that went a long way to costing the tourists the Ashes opener. Simon Burnton has taken a deep dive into day-night Tests and why they loom as the future even as parts of the cricket fraternity – including Root – push back against their introduction to the five-day format, while also considering the impact of the pink ball. But there is an inherent problem with a pink ball: around sunset the higher-frequency wavelengths of light become scattered and for a short time red light becomes dominant. This is why the sun, having appeared yellow all day, often looks orange or red as it sets. A number of academic studies have identified a change in the pink ball’s contrast polarity – the relationship between an object and its background – during this period. With all the red light around it becomes harder to see. The pink Kookaburra also swings more than their red version while new, so put a fresh one in the hands of a skilled seamer at the right time of day and havoc can ensue – particularly at the Gabba, where Brisbane’s humidity already helps swing bowlers. England recover from an all-too familiar horror start as Zak Crawley and Joe Root steer the tourists to 98 for two at tea. Pink-ball specialist Mitchell Starc did the early damage under the blazing sun with a pair of wickets in his opening two overs as both Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope were dismissed for a duck. Crawley bounced back from his own pair of ducks in Perth to reach an unbeaten half-century while Root made the most of being given a second life when dropped off the third ball of his innings to reach the break on 32 not out. The England duo have put together the longest partnership so far in the series, while Australia have been unable to turn to a specialist spinner to try to break up the 93-run stand after leaving out Nathan Lyon for the first time in a Test on home soil for almost 14 years. 24th over: England 98-2 (Crawley 61, Root 32) 23rd over: England 94-2 (Crawley 57, Root 32) England survive another Mitchell Starc over as they shut up shop with the break now within reach. Crawley punishes the closest Starc comes to a loose delivery with a single off his pads. 22nd over: England 93-2 (Crawley 56, Root 32) BEATEN! Joe Root attempts to drive on the up but fails to pick up the late movement as he grins sheepishly at his own dose of good fortune. Zak Crawley punishes a looser delivery that drifts on to his pads with a clip to the fine leg boundary. The opener is playing within himself but ends the over with 56 runs from 72 balls, and England are within sight of reaching the first break only two wickets down. 21st over: England 86-2 (Crawley 50, Root 31) Zak Crawley reaches fifty for the 25th time in 110 Test innings as he answers the critics that came for him after a pair in Perth in the best possible way. The opener has only turned five of his half-centuries into a Test ton, but is looking more comfortable now that he has found a balance between defence and attack. 20th over: England 84-2 (Crawley 49, Root 30) Cameron Green is thrown the ball for the first time today with Australia increasingly desperate for a breakthrough. It makes sense to mix and match the bowlers, and prevent the batters from getting into too much of a rhythm, with five pacers in the lineup - and no Nathan Lyon! Crawley smacks Green down the ground and Doggett makes a meal of the dive in front of the rope as he carries the ball into the boundary. Martin Burley in New Zealand has found a creative solution to what he dubs the “Crawley Paradox”. “After Crawley gets a double century to win this Test, we should pocket our winnings and drop him before the inevitable string of single-figure innings that he’ll have in the rest of the series. However, if he loses his wicket soon, the smarter move would be to keep him in knowing that the one decent score he gets per series is still to come. Therefore, the better he does this Test the more justification for dropping him.” OK, am I the only one whose head hurts? 19th over: England 78-2 (Crawley 44, Root 29) Mitchell Starc returns for a second spell. He has already drawn level with Pakistan great Wasim Akram for the most Test wickets for a left-armer, but is unable to edge to the top of the list as Root drives for a single, and Crawley adds another through square leg. Cricket Australia has named the Australia A squad for the four-day match against England Lions at Allan Border Field from tomorrow – and Sam Konstas is the notable absentee. Beau Webster will get some game time after missing out on the opening two Ashes Tests, while Matt Renshaw, Jhye Richardson and Josh Philippe have been recalled. Nathan McSweeney will captain Australia A side for this fixture. Australia A squad: Nathan McSweeney (capt), Beau Webster, Campbell Kellaway, Cooper Connolly, Fergus O’Neill, Jhye Richardson, Josh Philippe, Matt Renshaw, Ryan Hadley, Todd Murphy, Xavier Bartlett. 18th over: England 76-2 (Crawley 43, Root 28) DROPPED! Crawley goes straight down the ground and lifts another drive in the air. But Boland is unable to settle his hands in time to claim a tricky catch. They’re always tough when the ball goes back to a fast bowler, but Boland all but had two hands to that one. Both batters have now been put down off tough chances as the unbroken partnership grows to 71 runs. 17th over: England 71-2 (Crawley 39, Root 27) Doggett has found an awkward line and length as Root is happy to leave anything he isn’t forced to play at. But when the second-Test bowler drifts onto his pads, Root takes an easy single to fine leg. 16th over: England 70-2 (Crawley 39, Root 26) Root let fly with a cracking straight drive back over Boland’s head and to the rope. The Australia quick ends the over bowling at a nagging length as Crawley almost dabbles at a straight ball outside fifth-stump before pulling out at the last second. Brian Withington joins the discussion over the value – or otherwise – of Zak Crawley. “Did Steve Hudson forget to include ‘stupidly magnificent’ in his list of Crawley epitaphs? It’s certainly not dull, and I’d forgive him a patchy career average for one or two match-defining innings this winter [and not of the Perth variety].” 15th over: England 65-2 (Crawley 39, Root 21) Doggett gets the ball to jag back into Root and the appeal goes up for lbw. There has been plenty of bounce at the Gabba and that was sailing over off-stump. Doggett saves a couple with some sharp fielding off a straight drive. Root clips a single off his pads to end the over. 14th over: England 64-2 (Crawley 39, Root 20) Zak Crawley reaches wide and flashes at a wider ball outside off-stump. Most batters would leave that while England are comfortably rebuilding their innings, but that is the way that Crawley likes to play. Just one wide – which wasn’t any further away from Crawley than the one he swings at – from the Boland over. 13th over: England 63-2 (Crawley 39, Root 20) Brendan Doggett continues for Australia as he nudges 135km/h. Joe Root picks up the pace quickly and guides a straight ball through cover for three runs. Zak Crawley divides opinion about as much as any current-day cricketer. The England opener has been near his best today at the Gabba as he settles into an innings and gets his cover drive flowing. But an average of barely more than 30 across 60 Tests is hard to ignore. Steve Hudson is prepared to sit back and enjoy Crawley for what he is. “It sounds like Crawley hasn’t compromised his approach despite all the criticism England have had after the first Test. I can’t decide whether this is magnificent, or stupid, or magnificently stupid. We shall see.” Mitchell Starc has done the damage for Australia with two wickets in his first over-and-a-half, and heads to the drinks break with figures of two for 21 from five overs. The left-armer is at the peak of his powers at the age of 35 – a number not lost on Will Ellen. “In a probably futile effort to step above the fray, isn’t there something admirable about modern day sports science? The way it allows us to admire sportsmen and women late into their 30s? In the recent past, a fast bowler of 32 would be just about ready for the proverbial glue factory. But at nearly 36, Mitchell Starc is at the absolute peak of his career. He’s never bowled better.” 12th over: England 58-2 (Crawley 37, Root 17) Joe Root does well to dig out a yorker from Scott Boland – it seemed to take the batter by surprise. The England No 4 finishes the over with a textbook off-drive to the boundary. That might be the shot of the day so far and brings up the 50-run partnership before the players take a break for drinks. An entertaining first hour was almost worth the 12-day wait between Tests. 11th over: England 51-2 (Crawley 36, Root 11) Brendan Doggett takes the pink ball and the England batters will be relieved to see the back of Mitchell Starc for now. The left-armer heads to the rooms for a breather. Root picks up an easy three with a controlled cut shot, and Crawley finds the same with another well-timed drive. 10th over: England 45-2 (Crawley 33, Root 8) Australia rise as one in the hope that Zak Crawley has nicked a loose pull shot on the way through to the keeper. The ball is high and wide of offstump as it flicks the pad on the way past and Steve Smith has no interest in a review. Boland is testing the England pair but their blossoming partnership is now out to 40 runs. England have done well to recover from another horror start at the hands of Mitchell Starc. Tom Nolan insists he is “keeping the faith for now” as he adds … “Reluctant to email at all given that my opinions could be out of date by the time I have finished each sentence. Even so, trying to remain positive despite the two quick wickets. Not unusual that with the pink ball. “If England can see off the new ball, they should (!!) be able to crack on and score some runs before it gets dark and floodlights come in.” 9th over: England 43-2 (Crawley 32, Root 7) Mitchell Starc continues into his fifth over as Steve Smith relies on the left-armer to continue testing the England top order just as he did in Perth. Crawley drives in the air yet again but this time picks a gap at extra cover for two runs. The opener wafts wildly at a shorter ball but it somehow misses everything and clears keeper Carey for four byes. Crawley then dispatches a fuller ball straight down the ground and is fortunate that Starc can’t get his left mit around it. Australia won’t mind giving up a few runs as the half-chances keep coming from Crawley. 8th over: England 32-2 (Crawley 25, Root 7) Scott Boland replaces Michael Neser and soon finds movement back into Joe Root. Boland has a strong record against the England No 4 – as well as Crawley – but this time Root clips off his pads for an easy single. Crawley ends the over doing much the same. 7th over: England 30-2 (Crawley 24, Root 6) Crawley will never die wondering and a flash outside offstump clears the infield and lands safely for two runs. The opener is fortunate when a yorker holds its line and lands wide of offstump as Crawley plays and misses. 6th over: England 28-2 (Crawley 22, Root 6) Crawley works Neser off his pads for a couple of runs at midwicket and drives wide of mid-on for three more. The opener is looking comfortable playing to the offside as he settles in. 5th over: England 23-2 (Crawley 17, Root 6) A relatively tame over from Starc as Crawley picks up an early single with a punch to mid-off, and Root looks to leave anything he isn’t forced to play at. A trademark inswinging yorker from Starc draws Root into his forward defence but the former skipper survives. 4th over: England 22-2 (Crawley 16, Root 6) Michael Neser holds his line and draws an edge from Zak Crawley. The ball bounces off the batter and drops well short of the slips cordon that have been busy with both Starc and Neser getting early movement. Then Steve Smith doesn’t act on a half-hearted appeal for caught behind. Neser was by far the most interested, and replays show he has good reason to be with a very faint spike. Among all that, Crawley crunches a couple of boundaries and adds two runs to backward point. 3rd over: England 11-2 (Crawley 5, Root 6) Mitchell Starc has two in as many overs and it very nearly is three with England all at sea. Joe Root is in and facing the pink ball within three overs and could hardly be more fortunate as a heavy nick just falls short of a diving Steve Smith in the slips cordon and races away for four runs. England, of course, won the toss and elected to bat with the idea that this is the better time to be at the crease. Mitchell Starc strikes again! Olllie Pope can’t resist swinging at a wider ball that pitches back of a length and chops on to his stumps. A three-ball duck for Pope and England are already on the ropes. 2nd over: England 5-1 (Crawley 5, Pope 0) Michael Neser takes the new ball in his first Test for a few days short of three years. The right-armer is straight on the money bowling at a tick over 130km/h as Crawley leaves three deliveries then is forced to defend the next couple. A play and a miss at the final ball is fortunate to clear the bat. 1st over: England 5-1 (Crawley 5, Pope 0) Mitchell Starc’s incredible streak of taking a wicket in the opening over of an innings continues as the left-armer draws Ben Duckett into reaching for the ball. Zak Crawley does well to survive three deliveries then gets his first runs of the series as a cover drive races away to the boundary. The England opener digs out an inswinging yorker with a jab – and a single – to midwicket, but Duckett is already on his way. Mitchell Starc. First over. Wicket. Perfect start for Australia. It feels like we’ve been here before. Ben Duckett lunges forward, gets a nick and is caught at first slip for a golden duck. Crawley shoulders arms at the first ball – and survives. But George Thomson is far from convinced the England opener will be around for much longer in Brisbane. “Stand aside Graeme Hick, Greg Blewett, Mark Ramprakash, Mohammad Ashraful. Today, Zak Crawley indisputably becomes the most selector-indulged Test batter in history.” Zak Crawley marks out his place after copping a pair in Perth when dismissed by Mitchell Starc in the first over of each innings. Ben Duckett stands at the non-striker’s end for England as the second Test begins at the Gabba. Here we go … Australia would have preferred to bat first and ideally manage the game so that Mitchell Starc might run wild under lights. The left-armer stands apart in pink-ball Tests with 81 wickets at a click of 17, but will take the ball under the blazing sun on day one of the second Ashes Test. James Wallace finds out – from batters who have dared to stare down Starc from 22 years – what makes him such a menace with the pink ball. The sun is belting down in Brisbane with a touch of cloud around as the mercury hits the expected high of 27C. The players are standing around the boundary getting ready to begin the formalities at the Gabba that will include a minutes silence for the late Robin Smith. Daniel Pollard has been in touch with his memories of “the Judge”. “As a 45-year-old cricket lover my first proper technicolor memories of English cricket were the unforgiving 90s when we seemed almost always under the cosh. Certain players walking to the crease just somehow gave you the feeling that things might, just might, be OK. Thorpey was of course one. Robin Smith was another. “Arms like cannons in the days that pounding weights in the gym wasn’t de rigueur. No grill covering his face – he didn’t fear getting pelted with 90mph missiles ball after ball after ball. But moreover you just felt here was a guy who was up for the fight. RIP Judge. Say hi to Warnie for us. I expect the upstairs nets are pretty busy this week.” England have been happy to chase during Ben Stokes’ reign but elected to bat – and perhaps control the flow of the game – in the day-night Test at the Gabba. The tourists’ captain explains the decision and how England can bounce back from their demoralising defeat in the Ashes opener. We come here off the back of a disappointing week last week. So hopefully we can find those runs. You look at how things play out with the different conditions, give yourself a better chance to know that you are going to bat in the, sort of, easier conditions. Not too sure how the wicket is going to play. We have got an opportunity to put runs on the board. It’s certainly the biggest week of my captaincy up until now but we’ve had a good week and we’re raring to go. Steve Smith was the one to drop the selection bombshell and it wasn’t the one we expected with Pat Cummins increasingly likely to miss out as the players arrived at the Gabba, but the decision to leave out off-spinner Nathan Lyon. The stand-in skipper explains both calls … Pat was close. He’s done everything right. We thought it might be a bit risky for this game but he’s tracking well for the next one [in Adelaide]. Josh Inglis will bat in the middle, Head will open. Michael Neser is in for Nathan Lyon with the pink ball. We think it’s going to offer quite a bit, particularly later on under lights. We play in the night a lot and thought that was going to be the best attack to take 20 wickets. England: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (capt), Jamie Smith (wk), Will Jacks, Brydon Carse, Gus Atkinson, Jofra Archer. No tomfoolery from England as Will Jacks is picked for his third Test and replaces Mark Wood in the XI that played in the defeat in Perth. The 27-year-old bolsters the tourists’ batting which runs even deeper with him in the side, though he has been picked in Brisbane just as much for his off-spin. A six-for on debut in Pakistan in 2022 suggests Jacks’ bowling will be useful if and when the pink ball softens at the Gabba, though he has only bowled another 14 overs across three Test innings since then. All eyes will be on Jofra Archer, especially with Wood now absent, when England take their turn to bowl in Brisbane. But, for now, they will hope to bat much longer than the 30-odd overs that they managed in both innings in Perth. Australia: Jake Weatherald, Travis Head, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith (capt), Cameron Green, Josh Inglis, Alex Carey (wk), Michael Neser, Mitchell Starc, Scott Boland, Brendan Doggett. The speculation comes to a close but the debate will continue across the afternoon at least, as Australia turn to a horses for course approach with Nathan Lyon left out of a home Test for the first time in almost 14 years. The off-spinner was also omitted from the XI in Australia’s most recent pink-ball Test in the Caribbean, but it still feels like a huge call to leave out a bowler who has claimed 562 wickets. Michael Neser comes in to add more pace in the day-night Test, as well as reducing the length of the Australia tail. As expected, Josh Inglis replaces Usman Khawaja in the lineup for his fourth Test – though the 30-year-old will bat in the middle order with Travis Head hard to move out of the opening slot. Ben Stokes calls correctly and England will bat first in the second Ashes Test at the Gabba. Steve Smith would have preferred to bat first as well. Steve Smith joins Ben Stokes at the toss as Australia captain Pat Cummins remains on ice to continue his recovery from a back stress issue. England and Australia will wear black armbands on day one of the second Test in memory of former England and Hampshire batter Robin Smith, who passed away earlier this week. There will also be a moments silence before the national anthems. Tanya Aldred has written a beautiful tribute to Robin Smith, who stood tall when England cricket was at a low point through the late 1980s and early 1990s. Smith’s cut, alongside a David Gower cover drive, gave hope where there was little left in the bucket. Those famous forearms – half oak, half baobab – the white shirt unbuttoned past the clavicle, the chain glinting through his chest hair, smelt enticingly like bravery, and old spice and one last throw of the dice. The sight of Smith marching out to bat – as an opener (in four Tests), No 3 (six), No 4 (30), No 5 (19), No 6 (14) or No 7 (twice) – those charmingly indecisive selectors never could quite place him – was a high point in a largely post-Botham era, a clear-the-bars alarm for those in the ground and a stay‑your‑ground sign to those on the sofa. Our selection dilemma detectives are casting their eye over Australia’s preparations in Brisbane. Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon have been seen getting around in flat shoes, while Michael Neser and Brendan Doggett are both wearing spikes and have marked out their run up. Ali Martin is at the Gabba and points out that this would be the first time Australia enter a home Test without Lyon since facing India at the Waca in early 2012. Meanwhile, Travis Head has confirmed on Fox Sports that he will open the innings whether Australia bat first or second. Usman Khawaja is already certain to miss the second Test for Australia after being unable to open while suffering back spasms in Perth. That of course opened the door for Travis Head to take the game away from England with a blistering century and the expectation is that the powerhouse will bat at the top of the order again in Brisbane. What time means for Khawaja – who turns 39 this month – could well be decided in the middle over the next two (please, no) to five days. Geoff Lemon has been busy pondering what it all means for the veteran and the future of this Australia outfit. Right now Australia are saying Khawaja is still in the plan, staying with the squad in Brisbane for his treatment. If he can storm back to have a decisive influence in the final three Tests, it would be a wonderful story to round out a career that has already given us several. But there’s a point at which Khawaja becomes Homer Simpson’s giant sandwich, and the team clinging on for too long faces a health hazard. Currently, nobody else knows what they are doing because the injured opener is the variable. Head doesn’t know if he has that job for a season or a week. Inglis won’t know if he’s coming in with licence to attack the series over four Tests, or needing a huge score from one. The argument for keeping Khawaja around since David Warner’s retirement has been stability, but right now he is the main destabilising influence on this team. We might have to wait to find out the Australia XI until either Pat Cummins or Steve Smith walk on to the Gabba alongside England captain Ben Stokes for the toss. But Geoff Lemon has already dived into what that call will mean for the hosts and the second Test. Cummins, it seems, is now feeling good enough in training that waiting for the third Test in Adelaide seems excessive. But overnight nerves might get the better of anyone in the decision-making chain, pondering the fallout that would await them if that comeback turned out to be too soon. That leaves a nation of Australians in the highly unusual position of going to sleep the night before a Test match without knowing who will captain the team the next day. The stand-in, Steve Smith, took the press conference as though he would do the job, but declined to confirm that this would be the case. If Cummins returns, the cards in the dealer’s hands could be whisked in various ways around the table. Perhaps in order to mitigate the number of overs required of him, he could be part of a four-man pace attack and replace Nathan Lyon. That might also mean bringing Beau Webster into the middle order, given he could offer spin. If Cummins plays alongside Lyon, instead replacing Brendan Doggett as one of three quicks, Webster could still be included to bowl backup seam alongside Cameron Green. The plot thickens at the Gabba with one of Australia’s heroes of the first Test, Travis Head, heading into the middle for a sighter of the pitch with pads on and bat in hand. I promised the conjecture would continue and especially over whether Pat Cummins would be injected into the Australia XI after impressing in the nets in Brisbane. But if being left out of the squad was the first sign that the fast bowler would have to wait a little longer before playing a part in this Ashes series, Steve Smith inspecting the pitch alongside coach Andrew McDonald – rather than the formal Test captain – could be the strongest pointer yet. Cummins arrived earlier at the Gabba wearing a polo shirt, while the other Australia players are decked out in their training shirts. This could be elite attention to detail from Australia, but feels more likely to be the end of the fun n games. We’re back! After a two-day taster of the most highly anticipated Ashes on Australian soil for years, if not decades, was followed by 12 days of fresh dissection, discussion and debate, the second Test finally begins in Brisbane this afternoon. Welcome to day one of the second Test of the 2025-26 Ashes. The conjecture continues with Australia yet to name their XI for the pink-ball Test at the Gabba. Captain Pat Cummins is in line for a late call-up after being left out of the squad as he recovers from a back injury, while Josh Inglis is widely expected to slide into the middle order and allow Travis Head to reprise his rollicking role as opener in the absence of Usman Khawaja. All will be revealed at the toss, stand-in skipper Steve Smith promised yesterday, as the Australia outfit unusually plays their cards close to their chest. There are fewer surprises in the England camp as Will Jacks has already been picked in the XI. The batting all-rounder replaces Mark Wood in the side that collapsed to defeat in the Ashes opener, as the speed demon is forced out – as a precaution, we are told – due to soreness in the left knee that he happened to have surgery on earlier this year. But whether the tourists double down and roll out the same captivating yet chaotic strategy remains to be seen. It lifted England to a promising position in Perth before their own blunders with the bat and Head’s heroics loosened their grip on the first Test in a matter of hours and they quickly fell behind 1-0 in the series. More chaos can be expected in Brisbane in the next few days – and hopefully longer – as the city again hosts a day-night Test. Australia are vastly more experienced in the varied conditions and tactics that come with the pink ball being delivered across the afternoon, dusk and early evening, and have won 13 of the 14 day-night Tests they have played. But the one blemish on that record came the last time they played with the pink ball at the Gabba, when West Indies stunned the hosts under lights in January 2024. The Gabbatoir is not quite the fortress that it once was for Australia, but they have not lost to their oldest rivals at the venue since 1986. This iteration of England under captain Ben Stokes seeks to separate themselves from those that came before but have even more history to rewrite than they might like in Brisbane. They have lost five of their seven day-night Tests, and last played with the pink ball in February 2023, though that at least ended with a victory over New Zealand at Mount Maunganui. Of more concern might be the threat of falling 2-0 behind, knowing that only one side – under the guidance of a certain Don Bradman in 1936-37 – has overturned such a deficit to win an Ashes series. There is still an hour to go before the toss and confirmed teams – with first ball to be bowled at 2pm in Brisbane / 3pm AEDT / 4am GMT. Plenty of time to get in touch with your thoughts and predictions for the second Test and perhaps beyond – drop me an email or find me @martinpegan on Bluesky or X. In the meantime, I’ll help you catch up on all that has happened during the frankly painstaking 12-day fallow period between Tests, and in the lead up to the day-nighter at the Gabba. Let’s get into it …"

Archer bowls a nothing over, his 14th of the innings. England look almost cooked. Almost. “It’s 3.16 am in Minnesota,” says El Rose. “I may have chosen the wrong night to make the effort but it’s tonight or never.” In the words of that great cricket commentator Richie Aprile… [NB: Clip contains adult language] 47th over: Australia 243-3 (Smith 35, Green 26) A maiden from Atkinson to Green, much of it landing halfway down the pitch. Sometimes, bowlers drop short because human beings are not robots and they can’t always land the ball where they want to. But this feels like a deliberate tactic, one that is hard to fathom in the circumstances. O Matt Potts, Where Art Thou? 46th over: Australia 243-3 (Smith 35, Green 26) Jofra Archer returns to the attack. It’s only a partial exaggeration to say this spell is England’s last chance. He bowls a zingy short ball to Smith, who is hopelessly late on a pull stroke and top-edges it over the slips for four. Smith makes a mockery of the previous stroke by leaning back to uppercut for six, a deliberate and utterly brilliant stroke. Quite why England are bowling so short, I know not. There is an argument that, in the face of formidable competition from day two at Perth, England’s performance today has been their worst of the series to date. “I’ve been awake since 5.30am with nerves, not just for the cricket,” writes Sam Charlton in Leeds. “My incredible other half, Siân, is defending her PhD in AI for medical diagnosis and care this morning. So here’s to a successful defence, both in Siân’s PhD viva and England’s first-innings total.” All the best, Siân! Let’s accentuate the positive: England have bowled so poorly that you are guaranteed to mount the most successful defence of the day. (But seriously, we wish you well. And if AI can do anything for plantar fascitis, I’m all ears.) 45th over: Australia 233-3 (Smith 25, Green 26) A good over from Atkinson… until the last ball, which is fractionally short and pulled sweetly over the top for four by Green. Australia are giving England a taste of their own medicine, scoring at 5.17 runs per over. How do you like dem Bazball apples? “Re: over 43 - you’re right, it is boring,” says Felix Wood, “but there’s nothing else that can be said. And it’s not really enforced errors plural - it’s a single unforced error repeatedly. Loose drive to balls on fourth or fifth stump. The most frustrating thing is that it’s not even like it’s relentless pressure from a phalanx of bowlers. “How hard would it have been just to leave Starc’s wide balls until he got tired? He’s a phenomenal bowler, so no doubt he would have exploded some stumps with those yorkers, but at least make him work for his wickets. I’ve even bored myself here. This is what England have reduced me to.” Weird thing is they played so sensibly against Bumrah for most of last summer. Perth and Brisbane are the bounciest pitches so it was always going to be a risky stroke… and I’m boring myself as well. “Oh lord,” says Phil Harrison. “This is the series, right here isn’t it? England have to get this session right. If they do, wickets can fall in clumps under the lights. But man, if they don’t this is going to be a long, bleak few weeks...” At least you can sleep through it. Gus Atkinson replaces Brydon Carse for the first over after tea. He has two slips and a leg slip for Steve Smith. Jake Weatherald, whose rapid 72 set the tone for Australia, chats to Adam Gilchrist Yeah it’s great fun, obviously, a pleasure to be out here. The Gabba’s a great place to bat and the atmosphere for a pink-ball game is awesome. [On his scoring rate] We always like to take the positive approach. They were aggressive with the short-ball stuff; it’s good to play off the back foot at the Gabba so they were a lot of scoring options. [On the pitch] It’s still really good to bat on. As the game goes on, with the heat and everything, I think the cracks will play a part. 44th over: Australia 228-3 (Smith 24, Green 22) With Stokes about to bowl, Smith pulls away due to the presence in his eyeline of a bearded fella in a gold rugby shirt, proudly clutching a plastic glass of 3.7% ABV Liver Compromiser, totally oblivious to his impact. AFter four dot balls, Smith cover-drives for three with a flourish. Stokes is blowing. He ends the over, and the sessioon, with a wide full toss that is edged safely for four by Green. Australia have their foot on England’s throat. They trail by just 114 and could take a decisive grip on the turn this evening. England’s bowlers were better than in the first session but still nowhere near their forensic performance in the first innings at Perth. They could be about to enter a world of pain. 43rd over: Australia 221-3 (Smith 21, Green 18) Carse is straining to get the ball fuller, the right thing to do on this pitch. When he overcompensates, an occupational hazard, Green drives crisply thorugh extra cover for three. He’s looked good so far. Smith looks anonymous, which is kind of ominous for England; he moves into the twenties with a squirt through point. The ball isn’t doing a huge amount, and England won’t be getting a new one tonight. It’s important that England fans don’t get carried away; equally, it’s reasonable to suggest that IT’S ALL OVER KAPUT FINITO THREE YEARS’ PLANNING AND THE WHOLE BLOODY THING IS DONE AND DUSTED INSIDE FOUR DAYS I CAN’T TAKE ANY MORE DISAPPOINTMENT YOU CAN FIND SOME OTHER SUCKER TO DO 2029-30 I’LL BE AT A DIGITAL RETREAT ON THE KERGUELEN ISLANDS if they have a bad final session, the Ashes will almost certianly be staying in Australia. I know it’s boring, but the biggest difference in this series to date is that Australia’s batters have made fewer unforced errors. “Soupçon,” says Patrick O’Brien. “I mean, yeah, well done using that word correctly and all. But admit it, you always say it out loud as ‘soup can’.” Au contraire, I tend to go for the full, Amelie-style ‘Monsieur Quincampoix’. Possibly a cancellable offence these days. But it’s done with love! 42nd over: Australia 215-3 (Smith 18, Green 15) Another boundary, though there was nothing wrong with the bowling this time. Stokes squared up Green, who got a thick edge through the slips. Stokes effs and jeffs at the batter, prompting this exchange on commentary Ebony Rainford-Brent I think Stokes was fuming. Alastair Cook [deadpan] Can you lipread, Ebony? You had to be there. Maybe it’s an alpha/allrounder thing but Stokes’ intensity seems to go up a notch when he bowls to Green. That and his F-word percentage. 41st over: Australia 209-3 (Smith 17, Green 10) Duckett makes a fine diving stop in the covers when Green punches a drive off Carse. A better over from Carse, with nothing too short; a maiden in fact. England are back in it! “I’m currently following the OBO while sitting alongside my wife’s hospital bed, as she gave birth to our daughter Audrey at 11am this morning,” writes DanieL McDonald. “Mother and child are doing amazingly well, making me somewhat redundant. The first cricket game I attended was with my dad, the first day of the 1990 Ashes Test in Brisbane, where England were bowled out before stumps and squandered a good match position with a third-innings capitulation (familiar?). I won’t foist it upon her, but maybe Audrey’s first match will an Ashes Test in the new Brisbane Olympic stadium? Whatever comes her way in this crazy mixed up world, I hope she finds something that brings her as much pleasure as Test cricket, and especially the OBO, has for me. Thank you.” Aww, many congratulations to Daniel, Audrey and the unnamed Mrs McDonald. And thank you for reminding us of Brisbane 1990. Peter Bloody Cantrell. 40th over: Australia 209-3 (Smith 17, Green 10) It’s mildly bonkers that a player of Green’s quality hasn’t scored a century in a home Test. This is his 17th, with his highest score the punishing 84 he made against India at Sydney in his debut series. He demonstrates his abuindant class with a beautiful extra-cover drive for four off Stokes. Right, come on down and let’s play a game of spot the differences. Australia, 1st innings of first Test 132 all out (2.91 runs per over) Australia, since then 414 for 5 (6.06 runs per over) 39th over: Australia 204-3 (Smith 17, Green 5) Smith mistimes a pull off Carse so badly that the ball drops right in front of him; at the same time Carse falls over in his delivery stride. Elite cricket, the best of the best. “England should have had a go with Josh Tongue, an expert in removing the tail but also taking wickets further up,” says John Starbuck. “Carse and Atkinson are both adequate in most cases but rather too similar as well, with not enough variation between them. Given that we can now rely on Archer to strengthen the tail, the others’ failures in three innings loom larger.” I’ve never thought of Carse and Atkinson as being similar, but Tongue is certainly a point of difference. So is Potts, whose fuller length and ability to make the batters play would have been valuable on this pitch. He also gets good players out, right-handers especially, and was all over Smith in the ODI series in 2024. Either way, I don’t love the selection of Jacks. Would’ve made sense in a low-scoring dogfight, but not this. 38.2 overs: Australia 200-3 (Smith 14, Green 4) A ripper from Carse hits Smith on the elbow, the same blow he landed at Perth. Smith wrings his hand in pain and then receives treatment; it’s not quite Graham Gooch at Trinidad in 1990 but he’s not enjoying the physio’s poking and prodding. Eventually the pain subsides and he takes guard again. 38th over: Australia 200-3 (Smith 14, Green 4) Cam Green is Australia’s new No5. That was well bowled by Stokes – close to the length Jason Gillespie spoke about a moment ago, with a soupçon of away movement to find the edge. You’d imagine Stokes will settle into a marathon spell at this end, especially if he can get the ball moving under lights. I think he fancies Green too, having set him up beautifully in the first innings at Perth. Green punches a handsome drive that is very well stopped at mid-off by Archer. But he gets off the mark next ball, tucking an errant delivery to the fine leg boundary. England have been spitting out four-balls today. Eeeeeesh, how England needed that. Labuschagne tries to force a good ball from Stokes and gets the thinnest of edges that is well caught by the tumbling Smith. The end of a terrific, quietly forceful innings from Labuschagne, whose 65 came from only 78 balls. Josh Hazlewood is a doubt for the rest of the series after suffering another setback. At this rate, Australia will be able to play him as a specialist batter for the last two Tests. 37th over: Australia 196-2 (Labuschagne 65, Smith 14) Last winter I stayed up into the small hours and watched Brydon Carse bowl like a dream against New Zealand. He was forensic, intimidating, insistent, and he looked like a banker for this series. Alas, today he is bowling pure, unadulterated filth – and not the good kind. The first ball of his eighth over is short on leg stump, and you’ll never guess what Labuschagne does with it?!?! You betcha: a pull round the corner for four more. Tihs is another reason England needed five bowlers, as insurance for somebody having an off day. Two sides to every story, though, and Labuschagne in particular is playing with clarity and ruthlessness. Smith cuts for three to bring up the fifty partnership. Even Jason Gillespie, one of the most empathic, gentle and polite people in cricket, is going off on one in the commentary box about the performance of attacks in this game. “At Perth and Brisbane,” he says, “you want to bowl as short as you can while still getting the batsmen to come forward. In the modern game I’m seeing a lot of impatience.” 36th over: Australia 189-2 (Labuschagne 58, Smith 14) Stokes replaces Archer. His first ball is too short and pulled easily round the corner for four by Labuschagne. England picked the wrong attack – Matt Potts should have played, mainly to bowl to this pair – and have doubled down by bowling really poorly. But apart from that it’s been an unmitigated triumph. In other news, this, from Chris Paraskevas, is an early contender for my favourite email of the 2025-26 Ashes. G’day Rob. Hope you’re well! (I am properly pi$$ed.) Quintessential gorgeous Sydney day today peaking at around 35 degrees celcius in the arvo. Had the Xmas work function off and the afternoon was shaping up to be an absomur3 disastwr when I realised I was the obly one hitting the turps (going at a strike rate of three drinks an hour) and then to top it off- The Old Fitzroy pub literally ran out of burgers (this is afrer I clweayrly saw thwir chef cooking 8 burgers when I accidentally walked into the kitchen lookingnfor the dunny). Anyway long story ahort / sober: had to make do with fish and chips (doesn’tr really absorb the alcohol but that’s a grwat rhing upon reflection) At one point I averted complete catastrophe when the bartender came to remove my empty glass - only to realize I had the MBM and a stream of the game fired up and the phone rreasted against the glass. Might hit the Bottle-O and keep the party going all night, this game is actually going to g0 past 2 dayz (m??+?!?!?!?!?). How good is life inn Australia / the permanent shadow of the pub!?“PS. England bowlint .... bad. Just say no, kids. (Btw you can see Chris’s short film here. It’s not about his Christmas party.) 35th over: Australia 182-2 (Labuschagne 51, Smith 14) England’s Carse has taken a serious spanking, with 54 runs coming from his first six overs. Labuschagne gets four more with a top-edged pull over the keeper’s head – and those runs take him to a vital half-century from only 67 balls. He’s back. Smith forces two more later in the over. Carse’s figures would look a bit grisly in an ODI, never mind a Test: 7-0-61-1. Thanks Angus, hello everyone. We’re about to enter the twilight zone, and unless England have a very good second half of the day, the Ashes hopes of this team will never be seen again. The next few hours are positively Brobdingnagian. As the sun sets on Brisbane, Jofra needs a spell and so do I. Time to hand the pink pill of the OBO to Rob Smyth and bid you all adieu. Enjoy the twilight zone, folks! 34th over: Australia 175-2 (Labuschagne 46, Smith 12) Archer continues and immediately draws an edge from Labuschagne’s dropping hands. It falls well short of the slips though. Third ball is slower and fades down leg-side where Marnus helps it along with a gentle caress that steers it past the fielder at fine leg for FOUR. I’m surprised Archer hasn’t been spelled here. he is clearly tiring and has shown signs of a side strain. Is Stokes taking unnecessary risks with his strike weapon? Or has he simply got nowehere else to turn? An email from Stephen Holliday thinks “there’s something quite nostalgic about all this. An utterly toothless England with no ideas other than to huff and puff and get burnt foreheads, and an Ashes series over on the morning of the fourth day of play. It’s like before Trump. Before social media. Before the internet. Endless summers without a care in the world. Really happy days. I approve!” 33rd over: Australia 170-2 (Labuschagne 41, Smith 12) Change of bowling as Atkinson gives way to Carse… and Ben Stokes issues a snarl straight away as he’s forced to Atkinson’s stop skew off the boot and gifts Smith two runs from the misfield. Smudge takes another two from the fourth, a leg-side no-ball, and then drives FOUR through mid-on from the last as Carse continues to leak runs. 32nd over: Australia 161-2 (Labuschagne 41, Smith 4) Archer enters his 11th over, the most of any England’s bowlers and the most frugal too. He’s going for just 2.36 per over and has the wicket of Jake Weatherald to his name. Given their history, Smith and Labuschagne seem happy to wait Archer out and attack the change bowler. Will Stokes risk Carse again, despite him giving up nine an over? He’ll have to roll the dice because Archer looks done and Labuschagne lifts him for SIX over fine leg to prove it. 31st over: Australia 155-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 4) Australia’s run-rate has dropped to 5.11 since Weatherald’s exit and Atkinson is slowly turning the screws on Smith, delivering a maiden. Looks like Archer is going to keep this spell going. England are going for broke. 30th over: Australia 155-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 4) Breathe easy, England fans. Jofra Archer has resumed his spell and his first ball is 139kph, still a good clip. Smith lets it pass down leg-side but he pulls the second square and steals a run. Archer tosses down a 146kph bumper and Labuschagne ducks it, rising with an impish grin. 29th over: Australia 154-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 3) Footage on air now is showing Archer in consultation with the England physio on the boundary. He’s staying on but looks to be stretching out his flanks. Atkinson is still rolling at the other end, faster and tighter than in the first session. He draws an ugly flash from Labuschagne first ball that sends Marnus back into his shell for the rest. A maiden ensues. 28th over: Australia 154-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 3) Archer is still delivering at 140kph but seems to be tiring a little. Smith works an overpitched ball for three and then another full one gets lashed through the covers by Labuschagne. Seven from the over. 27th over: Australia 147-2 (Labuschagne 30, Smith 0) The Old Firm of Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne reunite following Jake Weatherald’s departure for an excellent 72. Smith sees off two deliveries from Atkinson, happy to watch awhile. Breakthrough! Great bowling by Jofra Archer. He got clouted for four last ball and sought revenge. He has nailed Jake Weatherald bang in front. No appeals to the third umpire by the batter. He knows he’s gone. And sure enough, replays show it hitting middle stump halfway up. 26th over: Australia 141-1 (Weatherald 68, Labuschagne 29) Marnus steals a single and leaves Archer to Weatherald who is loving life as a Test cricketer. All the more now, as he crunches a late cut to the rope. Strewth, that was brutal. He took it off the third rib and it rocketed to the boundary. But Archer’s reply is a yorker and it’s got past the bat and thundered into the pads. Big shout! 25th over: Australia 141-1 (Weatherald 68, Labuschagne 29) Gus Atkinson’s girded loins continue to deliver tighter lines but minimal threat. He’s throwing them down at 137kph and angling it back in at the stumps. It’s all going well until Weatherald steps back and cuts like a knife behind point for FOUR. Guy Hornsby doesn’t like what the new dawn has delivered in the UK but, like all stoic Poms, is looking on the bright side: “Well that’s a sobering score to wake up to Angus! But we’ve been here many times before. England bowled 2nd XI stuff in the first session, but you have to hope they’ll have had a bit of a talking to in the break. And looking at how they’re coming out so far, it seems to have worked. There’s a really long way to go and we have the lights to come, so we are still right in this, we just have to bring the stumps into play. And pray.” 24th over: Australia 137-1 (Weatherald 64, Labuschagne 29) As Archer rolls to the crease, Jake Weatherald begins mouthing mantras. Lip readers, please write in to tell me what he’s saying to himself. Or is he just pouting and pussing like Mick Jagger? Whatever he’s doing, it’s working and he’s having fun out there. He clips Archer for another single as Australia take their target under 200. 23rd over: Australia 133-1 (Weatherald 61, Labuschagne 28) Atkinson has been given a fresh spin. His first four overs went at almost six an over but he yields just a single to each batter here. Perhaps tea has girded his loins for the new session? Darryl Accone is following from South Africa: “At lunch at the Gabbatoir, the best-laid plans of Bazzers and men lie in waste after Australia’s Baz-like start to their innings. It’s good to see cricketing intelligence whip cricketing inflexibility, to see respect for fundamentals trump the self-hypnotising mantras of a mindless cult.” 22nd over: Australia 131-1 (Weatherald 60, Labuschagne 27) Jofra Archer enters his sixth with 0-9: frugal figures but he’s paid to make breakthroughs. Weatherald works him for a single but Archer responds with a good line outside off to Labuschagne. Tight bowling but England need aggression from Archer. Players are taking the field for the second session of this pink ball Test. Jofra Archer looks full of beans (perhaps, literally) and is pawing at the ground like a wolf watching a rabbit on the horizon. Mind you, so is Jake Weatherald. He has thumped 59 from 56 for his first Test half-century and looks hungry for more. Here we go… With England reeling and Australia rolling, Stephen Smith is keeping calm rather than carrying on: “We’ve had a horribly traditional first innings 334 with a big score from the big man [the 183cm Joe Root] (his red inker and subsequent 70-odd average soothes me). And now top order runs in reply. Take away the run rate and this just has too much of a feel of an actual Test match. Where’s the flash where’s the pizzazz where’s the chutzpah? Hopefully Jamie Smith emerges after lunch with his hard cricket replaced by an e scooter helmet to get this all back off track.” Tom Banks isn’t quite as hopeful and asks. “Too late to fly out Jimmy?” Advantage Australia. The home side still trail by over 200-runs but on the evidence of that session they will reach and breach that target before the day is out. England may have edged day one and piled a few more runs onto an entertaining 10th-wicket partnership this morning, but they have dropped their bundle on day two through loose bowling, a dropped catch and abysmal body language. As Brian Withington writes in from Blighty under the gloomy headline ‘Fill Your Boots’: “The generosity of most of our batters has been surpassed by the bowlers, with a smorgasbord of long hops spiced with the occasional half volley. Bon appetit!” Joe Root’s unbeaten 138 was magnificent but Australia have erased it in a session. Can the visitors recover their mojo after lunch and give themselves a sniff of squaring the series? Or will Australia pile on the runs and rain down more misery? Time to grab a bite and wet the whistle. We’ll be back in halfa. 21st over: Australia 130-1 (Weatherald 59, Labuschagne 27) Stokes enters his sixth over with 0-32. He should be working on his lunchtime speech instead. It will need to be Henry V-at-Agincourt-esque to get England up for the second session. They are flatter than the Barmy Army choir right now. The run-rate is 6.19 and rising and both batters are set, stealing singles at will and slapping every loose ball to the rope. 20th over: Australia 125-1 (Weatherald 57, Labuschagne 25) Good change-up, England. Spinner Will Jacks is into the attack. Can he add a little more egg to the face of Australian selectors who left their own spin champion Nathan Lyon out of the XI? Not immediately he cant. First ball beats everyone and runs for four byes. Ouch. Now another FOUR as Weatherald taps a legside drifter to the rope with ease. A cut square yields another single. Jack now delivers a rank full toss and Labuschagne bludgeons it down the ground for yet another boundary. 19th over: Australia 112-1 (Weatherald 52, Labuschagne 21) Since the dismissal of Travis Head, Australia have actually accelerated. This Labuschagne-Weatherald partnership is now worth 32 from as many balls and England look in the doldrums. They have given up 16 boundaries 18 overs and lunch cannot come soon enough. Stokes is trying to lead from the front but this Gabba pitch looks to be flattening. 18th over: Australia 109-1 (Weatherald 50, Labuschagne 20) FOUR more for Weatherald as his hip clip yields an eighth boundary. That is a terrible ball first up from Carse. And now the Tassie tiger doubles the dose, lifting Carse over slips. One bounce, over the fence. Australia’s 100 is up in just the 18th over. And now Jake Weatherald pulls sweetly for his FIRST TEST FIFTY. Well played, young man! That half century came from just 45 balls and featured nine fours and six. Now Labuschagne gets in on the action, pulling another short ball to the rope. And now he DOES IT AGAIN, driving down the ground. That’s 17 from the over! 17th over: Australia 92-1 (Weatherald 41, Labuschagne 12) Weatherald works a single to maintain his strike-rate of 100. He continues to look the part at Test level. Labuschagne is into his 60th Test and now shows why, leaning on a full ball from Stokes and sending it down the ground for FOUR. He takes another two through mid-on to make it eight from the over. 16th over: Australia 84-1 (Weatherald 40, Labuschagne 6) Dangerous leave, Marnie! Carse got that one to duck back and it shaved the off stump. Oohs and Aahs ensue as England bask in the dopamine squirt of Head’s dismissal. That will sober them up a little though. Labuschagne cuts crisply through the slips cordon for FOUR. 15th over: Australia 80-1 (Weatherald 40, Labuschagne 2) Massive bounce for Ben Stokes! And again Labuschagne makes a late decision to shoulder arms and almost comes undone as the ball ricochets off his gloves and narrowly misses the stumps. That’s how Jofra Archer did Marnus in the first innings at Perth. England’s fans are up and about now England have their first, the prized scalp of Travis Head. 14th over: Australia 78-1 (Weatherald 40, Labuschagne 1) Here comes Marnus. After suffering the ignominy of exile as a former No 1 batter in the world, the feisty and eccentric 31-year-old has fought his way back into the baggy green. He showed off a new technique in Perth and carted an unbeaten 51 in the second innings as Head’s wingman to win victory in the first Test. He gets off the mark sharply today. England strike at last! Carse steamed in with a scrambled seam and put it on leg stump. Head swung for the rafters but skied it and Atkinson pouched the chance. England have their first, Labuschagne enters the fray with Australia trailing by 257. 13th over: Australia 77-0 (Head 33, Weatherald 40) Stokes enters his second over. Head steps out to the first ball and slaps him down the ground for FOUR. England are in disarray here, still shoe-gazing after that dropped catch by Smith off Archer. Australia, by comparison, are playing eyes-up cricket. Now Head gets onto his toes to tonk Stokes away for FOUR through midwicket. Real danger signs for England (and Usman Khawaja) as Australia’s openers light up the Gabba at a 5.92 run-rate. 12th over: Australia 66-0 (Head 22, Weatherald 40) England needed that drinks break. What can they summon after it? Alas, it’s the same slop. Brydon Carse puts the third ball of his second over way short and Weatherald leans back and taps him over the fine leg fence for SIX! Slipshod bowling. Brilliant batting. Gervase Greene from Clovelly writes in to ask if “any batter has ever asked Jofra Archer to remove that chunky gold chain he sports around his neck? While it might offend many fans’ aesthetic sensibilities (including mine), if I were a batsman trying to follow a 140kmh thunderbolt such a glittery jangling distraction would infuriate me.” Gervase, allow me to submit for evidence this salutary tale in which Dean Jones narrowly avoided being scalped by Curtley Ambrose after asking the big fella to remove his armbands… 11th over: Australia 57-0 (Head 20, Weatherald 33) Time for a change, says Ben Stokes as England’s captain brings himself on. He delivers a full bunger straight up and Head feasts, flicking it for three. Stokes gets the next one on a fifth-stump line and the next follows but is shorter. Weatherald squares up and cuts hard. FOUR! England have been loose early here and Australia are making them pay. 10th over: Australia 50-0 (Head 17, Weatherald 29) Weatherald sneaks a single from Atkinson’s first to find a new highest Test score. Head has predictably decided to throw caution to the wind. He swings and misses at two but finds a bit of extra width from the fourth and BANG – it flies over deep backward point for FOUR. That’s Head’s first boundary of the day… but heree’s his second. This one is SIX! A glorious standing slash over slips for a maximum. Head hammers the next one but doesn’t quite time it and settles for three. FIFTY is up for Australia! 9th over: Australia 36-0 (Head 4, Weatherald 28) ALMOST A RUN-OUT! Head punched it into the onside and set off for the run but Ollie Pope swooped and threw and the Australian had to scramble to get back in time. NOW A DROPPED CATCH! Archer dug it in short and it leapt at Head’s throat, finding a thick edge. Jamie Smith got the gloves up but a fraction too late and it bounced off his thumb and fell to ground. Head somehow survives. Wow, that could be a massive moment in this Test match. Head taps a single to think on his second life while Weatherald slashes at Archer’s fifth ball and sends it soaring over the cordon for his sixth boundary. 8th over: Australia 30-0 (Head 3, Weatherald 23) Jake the Snake strikes! Atkinson pitched it up and Weatherald met it with full force, driving powerfully down the ground. Two balls later he finds the rope again, taking this one off middle stump and punching it to the boundary. Now he brings down the hammer again, this time cutting Atkinson through covers. Three boundaries in an over for for Weatherald! 7th over: Australia 18-0 (Head 3, Weatherald 12) Archer stays full to Weatherald who is seeing them well now and works a single with a punched pull. Archer bends his back to ping the next two in short to Head, seeking the ribs. But the man with the moustache takes both off the soup strainer and flicks them away without scoring. Although Joe Root and Jofra Archer found valuable runs for the final wicket, a few critics think they played day two unwisely. “England didn’t take the chance to bowl under lights on Day 1. Sensible. Day 2, third over. Root on strike. Why take the single first ball?” says Gavin Margetson. “Archer is a No.9 or 10, fair enough he’s not an 11. But England’s best chance of winning is if its best batsman spends as much of the 5 days as possible at the crease.” Tony Hughes agrees: “Bazball or whatever we’re calling this unnecessary aggressiveness made no sense here. All Archer had to do was block and play the poor balls, allowing Joe Root to make runs. England cannot go 15 minutes without trying to smash bowlers around. Make it make sense!” 6th over: Australia 17-0 (Head 3, Weatherald 10) Australia are away now. Each batter taps a single from the first deliveries of Atkinson’s third over. Extra bounce on the third and Weatherald flinches as the pink missile finds a crack and flies at his grille. Next ball isn just as fast – 138kph – but benign. Weatherald scampers a single from the last. 5th over: Australia 14-0 (Head 2, Weatherald 8) After 14 balls without a run, Travis Head finally gets off the mark, working Archer off his pads for a quick two runs. Archer has his pace up to 143kph but hasn’t quite nailed the line yet. Now he strays down leg and Head gets his hip on it, to send it skidding away to the fine leg boundary for leg byes. Fifth ball is a beauty, sizzling past the edge and making Head jump. 4th over: Australia 8-0 (Head 0, Weatherald 8) Runs at last! Atkinson is short on the second ball and Weatherald seizes on it, late cutting sweetly to the third man rope. Nice shot and a nerve settler for the 31-year-old in his second Test. Yowzer! Atkinson digs the final ball in even shorter and Weatherald takes it on, top-edging high over the slips. Roots and Smith give chase but it bounces once and goes over for FOUR. 3rd over: Australia 0-0 (Head 0, Weatherald 0) Twelve balls and no runs so far and it’s Archer v Head again. The England firebrand has drawn hints of swing from this day two pitch and is moving the ball across Head at 140kph+ looking to feed his three slips a snick. Head stays circumspect to the first four but steps down to the fifth but flays it straight to square leg. Another dot ball on the last. Three maidens! 2nd over: Australia 0-0 (Head 0, Weatherald 0) Now it’s Jake Weatherald’s turn. He has Gus Atkinson steaming in at him. And straight away the big quick is online, thundering the first delivery into Weatherald’s pads at 137kph and sending the second whistling past off stump. The tattooed Tasmanian had a ixed bag debut. He fell second-ball in the first dig at Perth but showed good signs in the second innings. With Head at the other end, he attacked England’s bowlers and swaggered to 28 while Head plundered his way to a famous century. Second over is another maiden. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Head 0, Weatherald 0) Head takes strike as he did in the first Test, shielding his junior partner and throwing down the gauntlet to England’s bowlers. Archer sprays the first three wide of off-stump and puts the fourth down leg. Head doesn’t waft at any of them. Instead he watches and waits. Finally he gets a straight ball he has to defend. A dot ball follows. Archer delivers a maiden first-up. Here comes Travis Head with Jake Weatherald to open Australia’s innings. Jofra Archer has the fresh pink ball in his hands at the Vulture Street end. What a duel this will be… here we go, folks. That looked a little ominous for Australia as Joe Root and Jofra Archer came out swinging and seized on some sloppy bowling from young Australian fast-bowler Brendan Doggett. But thanks to a magnificent bit of out-fielding by Labuschange, Australia has spared itself further embarrassment and will start their chase early in the day. Joe Root walks off with a wonderful unbeaten 138 from 206 balls and that tenth wicket stand with Archer (38 from 36) spanned 70 runs. How crucial will that wagging English tail be? Archer launches, looking for a six. The ball was back of a length and the big quick spun on his hip and sent it high into the vast outfield of the Gabba. Brisbane boy Marnus Labuschagne saw it coming early and sprinted to meet it, jumping full-length to his right and plucking the catch. Superb grab! England are ALL OUT! 76th over: England 333-9 (Root 137, Archer 38) Mitchell Starc enters the attack. Can he continue his remarkable run of dismissals in the first over of a spell? Archer attacks from the get-go, stepping out to a full delivery and driving handsomely to the rope. Great shot! Starc hangs the next one wider and it wobbles past Archer’s flashing blade. Starc reclaims his line on the next three and Archer is happy to bank his boundary and watch them sail by. 75th over: England 329-9 (Root 137, Archer 34) In his second Test, Doggett was ineffective yesterday, finishing with 0-74. He starts today with a short ball. Root pulls it but finds a fielder. He steers the second one behind square for a single. Jofra Archer adds another run to his highest Test score, swatting another short one. The easy runs for England continue as Root swipes to fine leg. Archer does likewise, ducking and hooking. Four singles, zero threat. Here we go. Brendan Doggett will open the attack for Australia and he’ll be bowling to Joe Root on 135. We have sunny skies in Brisbane and the mercury is currently at its highest level – a toasty 28 degrees. Conditions will start cooling off after the 6.32pm AEST sunset as we enter the “witching hour” of pink ball Tests. Presuming Australia snatch this tenth wicket quickly, where will the home side be by then? Here come the players onto the field… Mitchell Starc might’ve had Ben Duckett’s measure yesterday but his opening partner Zak Crawley did much better. With Joe Root in company, Crawley stood tall for England to pile on a 117-run stand and drag his side out of the abyss of 5 for 2 and stroke them into a position of superiority at 122 for 3. Crawley had carved 76 from 93 balls with 11 fours in 138 minutes before he became Michael Neser’s sole victim. Simon Burnton enjoyed the big man’s bounce-back from his double-duck disaster in the first Test in Perth. Mitchell Starc continued his incredible record of striking in the first over yesterday, sending Ben Duckett on his way from the sixth ball of the Test. It is the 26th time Starc has struck in the first over of a Test innings. England’s Jimmy Anderson is next (19), Kemar Roach (10) and Stuart Broad (nine) follow and New Zealanders Tim Southee (nine) and Trent Boult (nine) are also first-over demolition experts. Starc also got some high praise overnight from the man whose 414 Test wickets he surpassed yesterday. Wasim Akram got his 414 from 104 Tests at 23.62 while Starc has his from 103 Tests at a higher average but a superior strike-rate. England’s fans found some villains of their own, with no less than four of their side – Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Jamie Smith and Brydon Carse – failing to trouble the scorer. Of those donut kings, Max Rushden reserved special scorn for one English batter… It’s impossible to write this without saying the F word repeatedly. Just leave it outside the off stump. Surely there’s been some self-reflection since Perth. Surely. IT ISN’T THERE TO BE HIT. The whole Ashes is disappearing before our eyes. But if you’re English, Joe Root was the rolled gold star of the opening day. Having closely followed Root’s rise and 13,551 runs since his Test debut in 2012, Barney Ronay was happy to rhapsodise about the Yorkie terrier’s rescue job in Brisbane. Follow the story, the craft, the jags in the road, the pieces this thing takes out of you along the way. And at the end of it you have one of those great self-contained sporting moments, the sense of emotional connection through all the surrounding hoopla, the way Test cricket in particular can make you feel you know someone intimately just by watching them move and work and fail and come back. If you’re a hometown supporter, Australia’s selectors were the villains of day one, leaving an “absolutely filthy” Nathan Lyon our of the side to play Gabba specialist Michael Neser, and Mitchell Starc was again the conquering hero. Geoff Lemon paid fitting tribute to the big quick from Penrith who saved his side’s blushes (again) and whose sterling six-for swept him past the 414 dismissals of the great Wasim Akram to make Starc the most prolific left-arm quick of all. In a series supposed to be defined by Australia’s fast-bowling Big Three, he has done the work as the sole member to make the starting line. With one English wicket left to fall and his tally on six for 46, he was on the brink of the remarkable feat of recording career-best figures for the fourth time in less than 12 months. For those who came in late… here’s our blow-by-blow, over-by-over coverage of day one. Hello cricket fans! Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage for day two of the second Test between Australia and England at the Gabba for the 2025-26 Ashes. This match is beautifully poised, with both combatants seizing momentum then letting it slide throughout a gripping opening day. England won the toss and chose to bat but it was Australia who drew first blood, Mitchell Starc working his magic with the rapid-fire dismissals of Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope to have the visitors two wickets down for five runs. Joe Root strode out in the fifth over with a serious salvage mission on his hands. His team were one-nil down in the series, back at Australia’s happiest hunting ground of the “Gabbatoir” and still raw from their drubbing in Perth. But at stumps, Root’s resilience had carved a new legend to lead his side to an improbable 325 for nine. The 34-year-old Yorkshireman had also got the gorilla off his back at last with a maiden century in Australia to join the 39 others he’s amassed around the world across 159 Tests over 13 years.And with the help of Zak Crawley (76 from 93) and Jofra Archer (a dervish 32 from 26 late in the day), Root had hauled his team into ascendancy with an unbeaten 135 from 202. Despite selectors bizarrely benching Nathan Lyon to play a fifth seamer in Michael Neser, Australia entered the final hour of play with their tails up. Starc had another six-for, having seen off Duckett, Pope, Jamie Smith and Brydon Carse for ducks, and Josh Inglis had embarrassed Ben Stokes with a brilliant run-out. But at 264-9, England sucker-punched them, Root and Archer swinging the axe, seeking fast runs or a late-evening lash at the Australian top-order. They got the former, piling on a fifty-run partnership that will continue this morning to salt the wound of Lyon’s non-selection and his largely-ineffectual substitutions. So settle in and buckle up. Play begins at 2pm AEST in Brisbane, 3pm AEDT, 4am GMT."

They’ve been out there for an hour and thirty-five minutes this morning. 93rd over: Australia 427-8 (Starc 29, Boland 1) Pope is under the lid at short leg as Carse bangs in an over of short stuff. It’s a maiden but England are still out there, toiling under the hot Brisbane sun. 92nd over: Australia 427-8 (Starc 29, Boland 1) Stokes beats Starc and then finds his edge but it doesn’t carry to the slips. The good news for England is that this pitch looks flatter than ten day old lemonade. The bad news is Australia are happy to eke it out and make sure they will be bowling in the more conducive conditions. It’s ruthless and clever from the Aussies. 91st over: Australia 426-8 (Starc 28, Boland 1) BrydonCarse Revisited. The beleaguered Carse returns and nearly picks up Starc, a flat batted hack landing just short of Jofra Archer at mid-on. Ben Stokes takes the ball and brings himself on for a bowl. If you need a job doing… 90th over: Australia 425-8 (Starc 27, Boland 1) Archer rips one through Boland but it misses the stumps and the edge, clipping the back leg on the way to Jamie Smith. Archer appeals but with no joy and England don’t review. Australia are very happy to keep England out there in this heat. 89th over: Australia 425-8 (Starc 27, Boland 1) Atkinson goes to a bumper policy, somewhat confusingly, but finds his line with two good length deliveries to complete another maiden. No it’s you’re belief that is getting sapped away. 88th over: Australia 425-8 (Starc 27, Boland 1) Boland pulls Archer sketchily to get off the mark. Starc then carves a loose ball for four. Gah. “If Australia does go on and win sometime tomorrow, my heart goes out to all of us at OBO who have spent the last few years performing what we thought was the valuable service of dissecting how England could win in Oz, what the best team was, only to find out the answer is they can’t and there isn’t one. But enough of that, any thoughts who would be in your team for 2027?” I actually don’t think i’ve got the minerals in me to take this on, profuse apologies Peter Salmon. Ben McKinney maybe? The ghost of Len Hutton? We’re only 4 and bit days into this series of series and it feels like it could be all over already. I flew all around the world and left my wife and young daughter behind for this bullsh**. 87th over: Australia 419-8 (Starc 22, Boland 0) Atkinson bowls a tidy maiden to Starc and that’s the BIG FIRST HOUR done with. England have winkled out Neser and Carey but Australia have increased their lead to 85 runs. You know what that means… BIG SECOND HOUR. 86th over: Australia 419-8 (Starc 22, Boland 0) Just a single off Jofra’s latest as Australia increase the lead to 85 runs. Sandy C is a bit confuddled: “What’s with the Star Wars take over of the Gabba? And why is ‘I want it that way’ by Backstreet Boys the song of choice for the Barmy Army trumpeter?” No idea on the former or indeed the latter. That is an ear worm by the Backstreet Boys though, I’ll be “Tell me why-ing!” inadvertently at some point today no doubt. A memory soars into my cortex of my eldest brother performing that song acapella in front of our whole school in 1999. And you think you’ve got cojones. Let’s just say it’s a punchy key change. 85th over: Australia 418-8 (Starc 21, Boland 0) Atkinson continues. Starc tries a big yahooo but misses. He takes a single off the fourth ball to leave Boland with two balls to face. Atkinson beats hime with beauty to finish with. Where was this length yesterday fellas? Paul O’Neil speaks for a lot of awaking English fans: Hi Jim, I’m already anxious about England batting. I was here two weeks ago - that Saturday morning collapse - and it literally ruined my weekend. I’m 51, I’ve got a mortgage and a pile of marking to do. I don’t need this s**t.” 84th over: Australia 417-8 (Starc 20, Boland 0) Scott Boland is the new man but as Atkinson struck off the final ball of the over he won’t be on strike. Starc turns down what could have been an easy two off Archer. Not sure about that. He does take a single off the fifth ball of the over so Archer will have one ball at Boland. A fast ball from Archer but Boland plays it well, dropping his hands and letting it pass through to Smith. Gus Atkinson gets his first wicket of the series and it is the big one of Alex Carey! A wild swish is edged and caught by Smith. England don’t celebrate with gleeful abandon, understandably but that is a big wicket, Carey could have made things a whole lot worse for them this morning. The lead stands at 82, Australia have two wickets left. 83rd over: Australia 417-8 (Starc 19, Boland 0) 82nd over: Australia 412-7 (Carey 60, Starc 18) Archer takes the new ball from the Stanley St end. Carey gets in a tangle to a short ball but gets off strike. Starc then clips a wayward leg side ball for four down to fine leg. Directly underneath the OBO’s perch some Bobby’s on the beat arrive to sit in the next bank of seats to the Gabbatroopers. Could get spicy a little later on. This partnership between Starc and Carey goes into the 30s, the lead is up to 78 for Australia. 81st over: Australia 407-7 (Carey 59, Starc 14) Gus Atkinson has still not taken a wicket in the series. Every over that sees the scoreboard tick over is a double wound for England in that it is more deficit to knock off before they can even think about setting as fourth innings target, it is also more time spent under the baking sun and the more time they will be batting under the trickier nighttime conditions later on today. Hang on, maybe that is a triple wound? 80th over: Australia 404-7 (Carey 58, Starc 12) Starc guides Stokes for two and a brace of singles are picked off to make if four off the over. “Hello Jim. Gervase Greene here. I presume they are holding back Jofra Archer for the new ball, but given England need a double breakthrough RIGHT NOW do you think that is wise? Archer is supposed to be their premier strike weapon, and Australia will be about 100 ahead by then. Maybe more. The aphorism about horses having bolted comes to mind…” The new ball is indeed being taken, Gus Atkinson is going to have first use. 79th over: Australia 401-7 (Carey 57, Starc 12) Brydon Carse is flogged away for consecutive boundaries by Mitchell Starc! I’m sorry but that is poor bowling – short and with plenty of width for Start to throw the bat at it. That brings up Australia’s 400 and the lead is stretched to 67 runs. We’re into dangerous territory already for England after that loose Carse over. They need three quick strikes here to have any hope. Never fear England fans, there’s one more over til the new ball. Oh, you’re still thiknig about that ominous lead aren’t you? 78th over: Australia 392-7 (Carey 57, Starc 2) Just a single off Stokes to Carey and Starc is beaten by a beauty that skims past the outside edge. 77th over: Australia 391-7 (Carey 56, Starc 2) “Those Gabbatroopers. Are they from Starc Wars?” asks Andrew Goudie. BuddddummmChhhh. They certainly gave their man a hearty cheer as he arrived in the middle. Alex Carey gives them even more to audibly appreciate with a ramp off Carey for a one bounce four. A tucked single to leg brings Starc on strike and the tall fast bowler nearly runs his partner out with a sketchy single off his first ball! Stokes’ throw was a wild one in the end and the single is safely notched. 76th over: Australia 383-7 (Carey 50, Starc 0) Mitchell Starc joins Carey in the middle. We might see some opening of the shoulders here now. Carey angles away for a single that takes him to 50. The Aussie crowd stand and applaud. He’s a dangerous player, England will be very wary of him taking the game well out of their reach. He was dropped on nought of couse, penny for Ben Duckett’s thoughts. Gone! Stokes punches the air with a real look of determination as he gets rid of Michael Neser with his final ball. A regulation nick and Jamie Smith holds the chance. England get an early breakthrough. 75th over: Australia 382-6 (Carey 49, Neser 16) Carse slams down some short stuff into the middle of the pitch, Carey and Neser are watchful and pick up singles into the vacant leg side with the feel spread. Carey keeps strike with a single and goes onto 49. 74th over: Australia 379-6 (Carey 47, Neser 15) Stokes starts around the wicket to the left-handed Alex Carey. Two slips in place. The first ball is defended for a dot and the next is guided behind point for a single that brings up the fifty partnership between Carey and Neser. It’s a wounding one for England. Stokes bustles through the over, finding a good length and four dots to Neser. Brydon Carse is going to start from the other end, he had a bruising day yesterday, a couple of wickets here would take the edge off. England gather on the boundary edge, the sun is beating down here in Brisbane, it is 29 degrees and quite humid. Hot enough for the pitch-side broadcasters to be sheltering under parasols. Ben Stokes and Joe Root share a giggle as they wait to enter the field of play. They look pretty relaxed but they’ll know deep down this is it. Pantomime boos ring out from the Gabbatroopers as England take the field, followed by throaty chears for Carey and Neser. Right here we go. Buckle up. Ben Stokes is going to start with the ball from the Stanley Street End. BIG FIRST HOUR. Let’s play! These guys are sat right beneath us. No chance they’ll put me off my OBO-ing stride. (Gulp) “Call that a pithy update Wallooooo, you SUCK!” The new ball is seven overs away for England, the huge question is how long and how many for Australia with the bat. The lead stands at 44, which already feels seismic given how England – bar Joe Root – batted in the first innings. A lead of over 100 could be terminal for England. There’s talk in the press box from the more misty eyed English journos of today being the day for a Harry Brook special. That’d make things interesting wouldn’t it? We’ve got ten minutes until day three gets underway. Did I mention – BIG FIRST HOUR! We interrupt this broadcast… “Hi Jim, over in New Zealand, West Indies are 415 for 6 needing 116 more for a ridiculous victory in the final session. It is simply glorious.” Thanks Yacine Semmar. Down to 106 now… are the West Indies going to break their own World Record? We’re about 35 minutes away from that BIG FIRST HOUR. Time for me to tap up the media centre barista here at the Gabba and for you to delve into Ali Martin’s roundup of day two. If you are tuning in then please do whang me down an email like a Brydon Carse short ball, all of your thoughts, theories, lamentations and gleeful crowings are welcome. (Sort of) Simon Burnton had the misfortune to have to write about one of England’s worst performances with the ball in recent memory. Steve Smith looked ominously good for Australia yesterday before falling to an all-timer grab from Will Jacks. Not before he notched up his 80th Test match fifty and his 26th against the old enemy. Only two players have more in all of Ashes history — Jack Hobbs and Don Bradman. Smith is now level with Allan Border. Geoff Lemon was watching on: England had a shocker yesterday, five catches spilt, the cost of a couple – Alex Carey and Michael Neser – are yet to be fully told. Carey was on nought when Ben Duckett shelled him. The pint sized opener is having a match to forget, so far… The anticipation of death is worse than death itself ? Death smiles at us all, all we can do is smile back. For you are in Elysium and you are already dead. We could go on. Here we are, three and a half years in the making and four days into the series and the Ashes are already on the line. Are we about to witness the Death of Bazball? The great unravelling of the great experiment? Or are Ben Stokes’ England side going to roar back into the series with one of their great days to follow directly on from one of their worst? Sat here at the Gabba, I know which one feels more likely. Australia are 378-6 with Alex Carey and Michael Neser well set, a lead of 44 runs on first innings. The sun is beating down and to say this first hour of day three is crucial for the rest of the series is, for once, under playing it. Hello and welcome to the OBO of day three of the second Ashes Test from Brisbane. It looks like we might’ve made it to the end?"
sport_live_2025_nov_29_aflw-grand-final-live-north-melbourne-kangaroos-v-brisbane-lions.txt,sport,2025-11-29,Martin Pegan,North Melbourne beat Brisbane: AFLW 2025 grand final – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/nov/29/aflw-grand-final-live-north-melbourne-kangaroos-v-brisbane-lions,"Thanks a lot for following along as history was created in multiple ways as North Melbourne defeated Brisbane by 40 points in the AFLW grand final at Ikon Park. We’ll have more on the ruthless Roos in the coming days, but for now you can dive into the match report. North Melbourne foundation player, and a premiership player last year, Nicole Bresnehan presents the cup to Jasmine Garner. Bresnehan has missed almost all of this season due to a torn ACL but gets to play her part in the trophy lift. Kangaroos skipper Jasmine Garner and coach Darren Crocker have their say with the latter especially keen to emphasise the historic phrase “back-to-back”. The near-flawless, and certainly ruthless, Roos have not only won 27 matches in a row – they are the first AFLW side to win two consecutive premierships. The best on ground award goes to Eilish Sheerin after the Roos recruit put together a high quality first half that helped set up the victory. Sheerin finished wtih 28 disposals, nine clearances and two goals in her first decider after moving across from Richmond to join North Melbourne at the end of last year. Brisbane captain Breanna Koenen is close to tears as she thanks her teammates and acknowledges that North Melbourne have put together a special season as the competition benchmark. 27 wins in a row, that’s absolutely unreal. You’ve been the better team all year and you were just too good today. But I have had the absolute best week, so many memories and laughs. I wouldn’t want to do it with anyone else. To be in our seventh grand final as a club is incredible. FT: North Melbourne 9.2.56 – Brisbane 2.4.16 The record-breaking Roos have completed their AFLW fairytale with their 27th consecutive victory sealing a second flag – and the competition’s first back-to-back premiership. Brisbane threw everything at North Melbourne but, just as they have all season, the reigning premiers had all the answers as they end an undefeated season of domination with a commanding 40-point victory. Q4: 2 mins remaining: North Melbourne 9.1.55 – Brisbane 2.3.15 The Kangaroos are able to move the ball at ease with the Lions’ pressure finally dropping away. They have been gallant this evening, but the Roos have been out on their own all season. Blaithin Bogue has been quiet and is not quite able to win a foot race against two Lions defenders and boot a late goal. Q4: 4 mins remaining: North Melbourne 9.1.55 – Brisbane 2.3.15 Ball magnet Ash Riddell racks up records like she does disposals. This year’s AFLW Best and Fairest breaks the record for the most disposals in a grand final as she reaches 36 touches. Another honour might well be on the way to the Roos midfielder. Q4: 6 mins remaining: North Melbourne 9.1.55 – Brisbane 2.3.15 Ball magnet Ash Riddell racks up records like she does disposals. This year’s AFLW Best and Fairest breaks the record for the most disposals in a grand final as she reaches 36 touches. Another honour might well be on the way to the Roos midfielder. Q4: 8 mins remaining: North Melbourne 9.0.54 – Brisbane 2.3.15 The Lions bounce out of the middle with the clearance and look half a chance to score before Jasmine Ferguson desperately leaps to rush the ball through for a behind. Even with the Roos more than six goals in front, they want to finish the way they have started. Q4: 9 mins remaining: North Melbourne 9.0.54 – Brisbane 2.2.14 Jenna Bruton has her third goal – just. The Roos winger wraps up Natalie Grider in a tackle to earn a free kick 20 from goal, and only barely gets the ball over the pack. Q4: 11 mins remaining: North Melbourne 8.0.48 – Brisbane 2.2.14 Jenna Bruton steps back with the flight of the ball and marks on the centre wing as Jade Ellenger arrives late and gives away a 50m penalty. That’s the fourth 50m penalty against the Lions tonight, and Bruton is the latest to make them pay. Q4: 14 mins remaining: North Melbourne 7.0.42 – Brisbane 2.2.14 The party is just about getting started as Jasmine Garner boots her first goal of the night. The Roos skipper only needs a hint of space to kick her 99th AFLW career goal as Bob Marley’s classic Jammin’ rings out. One more for the Roos skipper would be the icing on the cake. Q4: 16 mins remaining: North Melbourne 6.0.36 – Brisbane 2.2.14 Bella Dawes is back fighting for the ball against three North Melbourne players. The margin might count against her being best-on-ground, but it has been a mighty performance from the Lions midfielder. Brisbane wouldn’t have too many cards left up their sleeve after a gallant effort during the third term but will surely resort to a play-on-at-all-times approach from here. It is easy to assume North Melbourne will cool things down with a kick-mark game. But they’re just as likely to put the foot down and finish their season with yet another statement win. Here we go … Brisbane have thrown everything at North Melbourne in that third term but the margin remains the same as it was at the main break. Q3: 1 mins remaining: North Melbourne 6.0.36 – Brisbane 2.2.14 The Lions keep the foot down but a miskick from Svarc into the forward 50 lands in Riddell’s hands and Davidson eases the pressure by giving away a lazy 50m penalty. Q3: 4 mins remaining: North Melbourne 6.0.36 – Brisbane 2.2.14 The Lions need another goal to make the most of their time on top as they lead the Roos 8-6 for inside 50s this term. Q3: 6 mins remaining: North Melbourne 6.0.36 – Brisbane 2.2.14 The Lions burst forward with one of the plays of the game as Bella Dawes twice wins a contest when outnumbered and helps get the ball to Dakota Davidson. But the attack falls down just 20m from goal. Brisbane might be matching North Melbourne’s energy at the moment, but they are still lacking a cutting edge. Q3: 8 mins remaining: North Melbourne 6.0.36 – Brisbane 2.2.14 Brisbane have lifted their intensity this term and deserved their goal. It looks like they are going to roll the dice with rapid but risky ball movement to try to find a way pass the Roos defence. Q3: 10 mins remaining: North Melbourne 6.0.36 – Brisbane 2.2.14 Brisbane have a sniff as Ruby Svarc boots their first goal since the early exchanges. The long ball has hurt the Lions for much of this grand final, but this time they get over the Kangaroos defence and the goalsneak is quickest to the drop. Q3: 12 mins remaining: North Melbourne 6.0.36 – Brisbane 1.2.8 The Lions defence continues to battle hard to close down the Kangaroos’ attack after attack. But the exit routes remain closed and it feels like a matter of time before the floodgates open. Q3: 14 mins remaining: North Melbourne 6.0.36 – Brisbane 1.2.8 Tahlia Randall is on the charge and launches over a pack to pull down a perfectly weighted pass from Ash Riddell. A clinical finish extends the Roos lead. Q3: 16 mins remaining: North Melbourne 5.0.30 – Brisbane 1.2.8 Ominous signs as North Melbourne pick up where they left off and burst away from the ball-up. Both sides are back on Ikon Park with the second half about to get under way. Expect the Lions to come out breathing fire if a pumped-up Bella Dawes gets her way (sound up). Lucy Single takes out the half-time sprint with Zippy Fish second. But Jess Hull might need to stick to running after totally fluffing her role as starter. Half-time sprint: Seven of the quickest players in the AFLW – and a Diamond in the rough from the Australia netball team – are lining up for the traditional half-time sprint. I’m not sure how middle-distance star Jess Hull would go over 100m but I’m guessing she wouldn’t be too sluggish. The Olympic silver medallist is watching on this time, as we have Ebony Marinoff (Adelaide), Georgie Prespakis (Geelong), Lucy Single (Gold Coast), Molly O’Hehir (Melbourne), Zippy Fish (Sydney), Ella Roberts (West Coast), Ellie Blackburn (Western Bulldogs) and Jo Weston (Australian Diamonds) getting ready to run. I’m with the headline writers in tipping Zippy Fish. The Kangaroos prized recruit Eilish Sheerin has looked at home in her first AFLW grand final with 15 disposals, four clearances and two goals. But it was this year’s W Award winner Ash Riddell who set the tone in open play with 12 disposals just in the second term as the Roos broke the game wide open. Charlotte Mullins and Isabel Dawes (14 disposals) have been important for the Lions, while Sophie Conway has also battled hard. But Brisbane will need to tidy up their forward 50 entries to stay in the game let alone reduce the margin against an all-conquering opponent playing like they are on a mission. After a shaky start the Kangaroos are showing just why they are on a 26-match winning streak as their smart set up across the field, neat disposal and ferocious intensity proves too much for the Lions to handle. Q2: 2 mins remaining: North Melbourne 5.0.30 – Brisbane 1.2.8 A second goal for Eilish Sheerin and the Roos prized recruit is having a huge impact on her first AFLW grand final. The former Tiger has an equal game-high 14 disposals and four clearances to go with her pair of goals. Q2: 4 mins remaining: North Melbourne 4.0.24 – Brisbane 1.2.8 The Lions just can’t find a way to convert while on top 7-4 inside 50s for the term, with only one behind to the Roos’ two goals. Bella Dawes brings Eilish Sheerin down in a tackle then sends the ball deep into attack. That duo have been among the best on ground so far. Q2: 6 mins remaining: North Melbourne 4.0.24 – Brisbane 1.2.8 The Lions aren’t doing much wrong as the intensity has noticeably lifted around each and every contest. But the Roos are just set up in the ideal positions and a critical touch cleaner on their way out of defence. Q2: 8 mins remaining: North Melbourne 4.0.24 – Brisbane 1.2.8 The Kangaroos have four in a row. Jas Garner marks just outside the 50m and briefly considers bombing the ball to the top of the goalsquare. But Jenna Bruton is standing in a prime position and gladly collects the deft kick, then nails the set shot. Q2: 10 mins remaining: North Melbourne 3.0.18 – Brisbane 1.2.8 The Kangaroos defence is set up like a wall across the middle of Ikon Park as the Lions are unable to find a way out. Not sure how much longer they can hold on under the relentless Roos pressure. Q2: 12 mins remaining: North Melbourne 3.0.18 – Brisbane 1.2.8 The Lions are a little flat after giving up a ridiculous cheap goal to the reigning and minor premiers. That was the Roos first inside 50 of the term, but they are racking them up now as the ball is locked in their forward half. Q2: 14 mins remaining: North Melbourne 3.0.18 – Brisbane 1.2.8 Oh, my. A 100m penalty. And Kate Shierlaw makes the Lions pay. The Roos key position player takes a mark and is shoved back towards the ground by Shannon Campbell. Shierlaw sets off to claim her initial 50m penalty and Campbell’s attempts to stay in front of her opponent cost her another 50m. It’s a tough rule but equally horrible game awareness from the Campbell and not what the Lions needed after a promising period. Q2: 14 mins remaining: North Melbourne 2.0.12 – Brisbane 1.2.8 In a repeat of the first term the Lions lock the ball forward but this time Orla O’Dwyer is unable to convert a set shot as the Roos have time to reset. Q2: 16 mins remaining: North Melbourne 2.0.12 – Brisbane 1.1.7 The second term gets under way much the same as the first with the Lions winning the initial clearance. The swing between the Lions opening few minutes as they locked the ball forward, and the Roos overpowering them as the first term went on, is shown in some of the ket statistics. Disposals: 74-59 Uncontested possessions: 43-29 Clearances: 9-4 Inside 50s: 7-10 A strong start from the Lions but the Kangaroos fought to get the game back on their terms and take a narrow lead into the first change. The was a red-hot opening term. Q1: 2 mins remaining: North Melbourne 2.0.12 – Brisbane 1.1.7 Erika O’Shea wins the ball across half-back and launches an attack that ends with Emma King flying high to mark just inside the 50m arc. The key forward quickly plays on to pick out Bella Eddey in a better position about 30m out and directly in front. Eddey goals. The Roos are back on top. Q1: 4 mins remaining: North Melbourne 1.0.6 – Brisbane 1.1.7 The pressure is mounting on the Lions defence as the Kangaroos take their turn to lock the ball forward. Q1: 6 mins remaining: North Melbourne 1.0.6 – Brisbane 1.1.7 The Lions have controlled the territory early to more than double the Roos’ inside 50 count, but there is a sense that the tide is turning as the reigning premiers tidy up their kicking. Sophie Conway has been busy for the Lions and no surprise that Jasmine Garner is already finding plenty of the footy. Q1: 8 mins remaining: North Melbourne 1.0.6 – Brisbane 1.1.7 Last week’s preliminary final between North Melbourne and Melbourne had a strong claim to being the best contest we have seen in the AFLW. This could clash could be a new contender. Both sides are being physical at the contest and clean with their disposal, as each defence is put under pressure early. Q1: 10 mins remaining: North Melbourne 1.0.6 – Brisbane 1.1.7 The reigning premiers open their account with a slice of good fortune. The looked to be incorrect disposal from the ruck contest but Eilish Sheerin pounces on the loose ball, shrugs off Shannon Campbell with a classic don’t argue, then snaps truly. Q1: 12 mins remaining: North Melbourne 0.0.0 – Brisbane 1.1.7 The Kangaroos win the ball out of centre clearance but it bounces straight back as the Lions attack swiftly between the arcs. Erika O’Shea wins the race with Ruby Svarc to knock the ball through for a behind. But the Lions are on top early. Q1: 14 mins remaining: North Melbourne 0.0.0 – Brisbane 1.0.6 First blood to the Lions. Charlotte Mullins wraps up Jasmine Ferguson in the perfect tackle and the Roos defender has no option but to throw the ball out. Mullins steps back and slots the kick for the opening goal. Q1: 16 mins remaining: North Melbourne 0.0.0 – Brisbane 0.0.0 The Lions begin the game just as the would have wanted by winning the first centre clearance and locking the ball forward. The Kangaroos defence looks impenetrable from about 30m out. North Melbourne and Brisbane players meet at the centre circle as the 2025 AFLW grand final begins at Ikon Park. The Lions get the first clearance but Roos stalwart Emma Kearney tidies up. Game on! Bonnie Anderson has completed the national anthem and captains Jasmine Garner and Breanna Koenen are giving their teammates one last rev up before the North Melbourne and Brisbane players head to their positions with the AFLW grand final about to get under way at Ikon Park. Jasmine Garner leads North Melbourne on to Ikon Park with under 10 minutes until the first bounce. Former skipper Emma Kearney, as well as Jenna Bruton and Kim Rennie, are chasing a third flag of their own, while Libby Birch could become the first four-time premiership player in AFLW history. Eilish Sheerin is playing in her first AFLW grand final along with All-Australian goalsneak Blaithin Bogue and Eliza Shannon. The latter was the unlucky player last year when Emma Kearney returned to the side as the Kangaroos broke through for a first AFLW premiership. Brisbane are out on the field with captain Breanna Koenen leading the way. The Lions take 12 two-time premiership players into the match, including Ally Anderson, Shannon Campbell and Koenen. Neasa Dooley, and former West Coast pair Shanae Davison and Eleanor Hartill will be aiming to claim their first AFLW premiership. It’s North Melbourne against Brisbane: take three. But, as Jack Snape writes, the consistent brilliance of the Lions and Kangaroos has highlighted a lack of ambition from other AFLW clubs, whose failure to even spend what they are allowed to on coaches is an open secret in the competition. Few in the intimate footy industry wish to point fingers at other clubs, but multiple officials have told the Guardian this season some programs are not spending the full amount they are entitled to under the league’s rules. Kearney said there were “a lot of reasons” for the success of the Kangaroos and Lions including how the clubs embrace their women’s operations, the quality of their high-performance programs, the standard of coaching and a commitment to fitness. But she said “the way the clubs resource their programs” was most important. The Kangaroos and Lions players have completed their on-field warm ups and now it’s over to Peking Duk to get the crowd moving. No changes on either side as Mia King remains the unlucky player for the Kangaroos after injuring a knee in round nine. Coach Darren Crocker must have been tempted to recall the midfielder who earned the full 10 coaches’ votes when these sides met in round five this season. Here is how the two sides have been named. North Melbourne B: Libby Birch, Jasmine Ferguson HB: Emma Kearney, Eliza Shannon, Erika O’Shea C: Amy Smith, Ruby Tripodi, Taylah Gatt HF: Alice O’Loughlin, Blaithin Bogue, Jenna Bruton F: Tahlia Randall, Emma King R: Kim Rennie, Ash Riddell, Jasmine Garner Int: Kate Shierlaw, Bella Eddey, Tess Craven, Eilish Sheerin, Vikki Wall Brisbane B: Shannon Campbell, Jennifer Dunne HB: Breanna Koenen, Natalie Grider, Lily Postlethwaite C: Orla O’Dwyer, Alexandra Anderson, Charlotte Mullins HF: Courtney Hodder, Taylor Smith, Sophie Conway F: Catherine Svarc, Dakota Davidson R: Tahlia Hickie, Jade Ellenger, Isabel Dawes Int: Shanae Davison, Neasa Dooley, Ellie Hampson, Eleanor Hartill, Ruby Svarc The AFLW grand final is a sell-out for the third straight year – and the second consecutive season under lights at Ikon Park – with more than 12,500 fans set to watch North Melbourne and Brisbane lock horns yet again. Let’s hope the AFL can find a solution over the next 12 months for a suitable venue that would allow even more fans to be part of what should be a celebration of women’s football as much as the season decider between the competing clubs. The best things come in threes. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the 2025 AFLW grand final between North Melbourne and Brisbane as the pair of powerhouse sides meet in the decider for a third straight season. The premiership ledger over that time stands at one-all, which gives each team an opportunity to claim to be the ‘best of three’ and the standout of the stretch. Though, in truth, the Kangaroos have already raised the bar to lofty new heights while embarking on an undefeated run since stumbling at the last hurdle against the Lions in 2023. The all-conquering North Melbourne are now on the verge of etching their name in the record books as the first side in VFL/AFL/AFLW history to win every game in a season on their way to the premiership crown. The Kangaroos have got used to breaking records over the past two years as the reigning premiers have won 26 consecutive matches since their only blemish of a draw against the Cats in round two last year. Perhaps most importantly for the Roos in their season for the ages, they are now just one win away from becoming the AFLW’s first back-to-back premiers after their breakthrough triumph against the Lions last season. The perennial contenders Brisbane are in the unusual position of being the underdogs at Ikon Park despite playing in a fourth successive grand final. This is also their seventh AFLW decider out of the nine that have been staged. The Lions have their own slice – or two – of history within reach as their third women’s flag would equal the Crows’ tally. It would also ensure the club becomes the first to win both the AFL and AFLW premierships in the same year. But a victory for the Lions tonight, let’s face it, would be most memorable for being one of the all-time great upsets over an otherwise dominant side that has barely been challenged for two years. We’ll find out whether the Kangaroos can finish writing their own fairytale, or the Lions script a stunning plot twist, from the first bounce at Ikon Park in Melbourne at 7.45pm AEDT.

sport_live_2025_nov_29_formula-one-qatar-sprint-race-grand-prix-qualifying-live-updates.txt,sport,2025-11-29,Philip Cornwall,Piastri claims Qatar GP pole with Norris alongside: F1 qualifying – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/nov/29/formula-one-qatar-sprint-race-grand-prix-qualifying-live-updates,"And here it is. Will Giles be reporting on an 11th British driver becoming world champion tomorrow? Or will it all go down to Abu Dhabi? Good night. Join us tomorrow, for a race that starts at 4pm GMT. Giles Richards’ qualifying report from Qatar will arrive shortly. So there we are. Will Norris come to regret that aborted lap? Or can he take advantage on the run down to turn one? Unlike for the sprint race, where the error left him on the second row, he is alongside his teammate. For Piastri, after a difficult three months, it’s a return to form that could be just in time. And lurking behind, ready to seize on any mistakes from the McLarens, is Zak Brown’s horror movie nightmare, Max Verstappen. George Russell’s failure to get ahead of the Dutchman removes the potential buffer for McLaren. Verstappen is asked about porpoising, which improved. He’s not buoyant but is relaxed. Piastri praises the team. But he sees it as a tough track, at least not as hot as in 2023. Norris says he got a bit of understeer on the aborted flying lap. “Nothing to complain about, I just didn’t do the lap.” Norris seemed to get confused by Russell and then made a mistake, and backed off. On the plus side for Norris, hold second place and he will take a 15-point lead to Abu Dhabi. Norris will be on the dirty side, with Verstappen third and Russell behind him. Piastri has the double pole. So a McLaren lockout on the front row but Norris had an aborted final run for the second night running. He is not happy. Norris pits with no lap taken! Pole for Piastri! Verstappen third, Russell fourth. Norris interrupted. Will he be able to have a flying lap? It’s 11-11 between Norris and Piastri for qualifying this season, the graphic tells us. Who will lead 12-11? The McLarens are going out, Norris first. There are 5mins 27sec to go when they can resume. Sainz had picked up a sticker off the floor of the garage. There will be an unsafe release investigation for Williams. Red flag. A piece of plastic stuck to one of the backmarkers’ cars came off. Big spin for Leclerc. I’m feeling dizzy from the on-board camera … Verstappen can’t touch the McLaren times … and nor can Russell. Max in fourth. Piastri +0.035 slower than Norris. Has the Briton found his form at the crucial time? Verstappen is doing a double warm-up again, while Norris is going well in the middle sector. 119.495 David Croft points out that whoever is fastest in Q3 has won the Qatar GP, with Verstappen triumphing despite grid penalties knocking him off pole. Here we go. Piastri and Norris could both swap to new softs, if required. Turn 10 is the key part of the circuit, it seems. So many deleted times, including for Russell late on. Piastri as a driver has the edge going into Q3, McLaren as a team have the edge over Red Bull. That’s it. Leclerc sneaks into Q3 in 9th; Hülkenberg, Lawson, Bearman, Bortoleto and Albon drop out. Isack Hadjar, who missed out on SQ3 because of a deleted time, survives in 10th. Antonelli escapes the drop zone that Norris had helped put him into. And he’s safe. Norris is 0.211 slower than Piastri, ahead of Verstappen, but it will all come down to Q3 for the title challengers. Lawson, Albon, Bortoleto, Leclerc and Norris in the drop zone. New soft tyres for Norris. Got to get into the top 10. Verstappen into the 1.19s. Just over six minutes left, Norris needs a time. Antonelli up to 8th with his first valid lap. Russell third fastest. Piastri and Norris now at it. 119.650 for the Australian, Norris done for track limits – no time! Verstappen fastest, 120.142. He took two warm-up laps before going for it. Piastri on an out-lap, Norris still lurking. OK, Q2 is upon us. Verstappen is out early, on new tyres. If there’s a consolation for the bottom five, it’s that barely a second covered all 20 drivers. Meanwhile the censors are out for Yuki Tsunoda, as Red Bull’s second man lets fly with the expletives after team radio tells him he has been eliminated. But at the front, at the very last, George Russell goes quickest ahead of Norris. It’s the first four from the sprint race but in a different order. Russell, Norris, Piastri, Verstappen. Now for Q2. Hamilton into the elimination zone! Out he goes with Tsunoda, Ocon, Stroll and Colapinto. It’s going to be close for Lewis Hamilton. Will he make it out of Q1? In 13th with time running out. Leclerc is fifth. Lawson, Tsunoda, Ocon, Stroll and Colapinto in the drop zone. Norris now finds his feet, four-tenths quicker than Verstappen – and Piastri cannot top him. Only 0.077 between the two McLarens at present. Verstappen goes fastest, Tsunoda 10th fastest. Norris down in 15th with half the session gone. He’s had a tyre change. Piastri goes fastest for now. Norris has plenty of time but his colleague is reinvigorated. Alex Albon meanwhile in trouble for a pit lane violation. Will have to see the stewards afterwards. Antonelli has breached the track limits at 10 again, having his first time deleted. Norris fifth fastest initially but being bumped down. Here we go. Verstappen has his first lap, 0.004 behind Alonso, who is quickest. The also-rans are running, the big names are lurking. Q1 incoming. The queue has formed, with a dramatically changed Ferrari, after their bleak weekend so far. Martin Brundle is talking about Piastri being on a “confidence perch”. Can Lando Norris channel his inner Alex Ferguson to knock him off it? It’s almost 9pm in Qatar. Sunday’s race will be over by now. I’ve often been puzzled when the timings don’t overlap, especially running into the evening when temperatures will be dropping. Qualifying will be hugely important – it’s very hard to overtake here. But there are a few traps to avoid, even if you are out in front. We saw Antonelli and Tsunoda done for breaching track limits in the sprint race, and Hadjar missed out on Q3 for a similar fault. Then there’s the gravel, which will cause tyre degradation problems. Everyone will have to changes tyres twice on Sunday. How would you characterise Max Verstappen? McLaren’s CEO, Zak Brown, sees him as something out of Halloween, the way that the Red Bull driver has come back into the championship race after being left for dead. The American has told Sky: “He is like that guy in the horror movie who you think is down and then suddenly it’s: ‘Where did he come from?!’ He is an immense talent, as good as anyone we have ever seen. I think we have to ignore him, we can’t control what he does.” Meanwhile Lewis Hamilton has been reflecting on another bad afternoon, Reuters reports. He started the sprint from the pit lane and finished 17th, while his teammate Charles Leclerc came 13th after dropping back from ninth. “I don’t know how we made the car worse,” Ferrari’s British driver said. “We started from the pit lane because we wanted to explore and make some changes. They had some things they found on the simulator last night. So we implemented those changes and the car was really in the wrong direction and very, very difficult for whatever reason, clearly for both of us.” Right, half an hour to go till qualifying. Things have got a little spicy since the sprint race, with Lando Norris hitting back at Max Verstappen’s dig in the week that he would have won the world championship easily for McLaren, the Briton claiming there are things his rival “doesn’t have much of a clue about”, the PA reports: Responding to Verstappen’s jibe, Norris said: “Max is very welcome to say everything he wants. He has kind of earned the right because he has won four world championships. I have a lot of respect, and he has achieved an incredible amount – more than anyone could dream of achieving – and that gives anyone credit. “He generally has a good clue about a lot of things, but there is also a lot of things he doesn’t have much of a clue about. “But it is also Red Bull’s way of going about things, an aggressive nature and just talking nonsense a lot of the time. It depends if you want to listen to it and talk about it he like he would love you to do, or do what we do as a team which is keeping our heads down and stay focused. “Maybe he would have done [won the title easily] but he hasn’t done so far.” Scores on the doors from the sprint race were that Oscar Piastri took two points out of Lando Norris’s lead, reducing it to 22, while the Briton added one to his advantage over Max Verstappen, taking it to 25. Of greater significance, perhaps, is that the McLaren duo and George Russell, in second, started where they finished. Which, apart from meaning this preamble has referenced The Generation Game and Mastermind, is indicative of how hard it is to overtake at the Lusail Circuit. Verstappen advanced from sixth to fourth but, given one of the two places was that of his Red Bull teammate Yuki Tsunoda, only his getting past Fernando Alonso really counts as an overtake, and that was on lap one. Charles Leclerc started in ninth but lost four places on lap one – and finished 13th. There is no getting away from how important qualifying is here, followed by that run down to the first corner. Piastri will be lifted by the return to the podium after seven races and the top step after eight. He also seemed to have the best setup of the two McLarens. But Norris made one mistake in sprint qualifying and if he can avoid that then pole is within his compass. Verstappen looked happier with his sprint run than with the qualifying for it but it’s very much advantage McLaren. The dream scenario for Norris? That he takes pole and Russell goes second quickest, introducing a buffer between him and his title rivals in the run down to the first corner for Sunday’s race. Q1 gets under way at 6pm GMT, 9pm Doha time. Join me for the buildup from 5.30pm. Oscar Piastri won the Qatar Grand Prix sprint with a dominant drive for McLaren. With the championship leader, Lando Norris, in third, it was a vital boost to the Australian’s title ambitions. The third contender, Max Verstappen, took fourth place, dropping a point to Norris. Mercedes’s George Russell was second. Yuki Tsunoda was fifth for Red Bull despite a track limits penalty, after Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli also picked one up and had to settle for sixth. With victory in the 19-lap dash, Piastri has narrowed the gap to Norris by two points to 22, while Verstappen has fallen one point further behind to 25 in arrears. Norris’s task remains the same if he is to seal the championship on Sunday. He must be 26 points ahead of both Piastri and Verstappen if he does not win the race or 25 ahead if he does take victory. If either of his rivals are closer than that margin then the title will be decided at the final round of the season in Abu Dhabi. A win in the race would be enough for Norris regardless of any other results. It is the Australian’s third sprint win, with Piastri having taken all three at the Qatar GP. The victory was the very least he required to keep his title hopes alive and to reassert himself after a period of underperforming, having led with such calm assurance for so long this season. It is the first race he has won since the Dutch GP in August, albeit the short-form version. The start was crucial and Piastri held his lead from the off with Norris just hanging on to third as he was pressured hard by Yuki Tsunoda in the Red Bull. He held on and Tsunoda, as expected, swiftly then ceded fourth to his teammate Verstappen. Piastri had good pace from the off out front as Verstappen threw himself at Norris, closing hard by lap three. Norris held him off, however, and with the initial charge on fresh tyres over, he put a solid two seconds on the Dutchman. It was the last real moment of any drama at the sharp end. The front four then remained circulating line astern, managing the gaps to one another and their rubber, so often a feature of the more pedestrian sprint race, especially on a circuit where overtaking is difficult. Piastri held his lead to the flag, without putting a foot wrong across the race. He must now do so again on Sunday to maintain the pressure on his teammate. Lewis Hamilton toiled for little reward after starting from 18th in the pit lane after a poor qualifying and finished in 17th place for Ferrari. Qualifying for Sunday’s race will take place later on Saturday evening and Pirelli has limited the use of tyres for the GP to a 25-lap stint, making the 57-lap contest a mandatory two-stop as a precaution against punctures. However, after Friday’s running the tyre manufacturer also expressed concern that gravel drawn on to the track by cars running wide was causing some deep cuts in the tyres. It may require the use of a safety car or red flags to clean the track of gravel debris. Giles Richards’ report from Qatar will be here shortly, and I’ll be back from 5.30 for qualifying. Novak Djokovic on trophy duty – and that’s my lot for now. “Our base performance around here is very good, so it’s more about tuning,” says Piastri. “George is doing a very good job but the team has given us a very good car,” Norris adds. “I never saw him,” Norris says of Verstappen. He predicts a tough race – not easy to pass. Which just adds to the pressure for qualifying. “Those last two laps was a real struggle,” says Russell. “It’s been a good weekend so far, everything went smoothly,” says Piastri. Verstappen may be happy but McLaren are delighted. Both drivers held their own and that’s all they need. Verstappen looks quite happy. His car certainly performed better than it did in qualifying. Ultimately it was more about laps than drama. What will everyone have learned for qualifying? Antonelli does seem to have got a five-second penalty. Which negates Tsunoda’s. Russell says his front left would have been in trouble had there been another couple of laps. Piastri’s first podium since Monza in early September – and, as mentioned at the start, a hat-trick of sprint wins in Qatar. Which means Norris leads Piastri by 22 points and Verstappen by 25, I think. 1. Piastri. 2. Russell. 3. Norris. 4. Verstappen. Piastri cruising home. Norris warned by the team not to risk track limits. Gravel is looking as though it could be a big factor tomorrow, putting drivers at risk of slow punctures. Not sure I would fancy getting a broom out during the race. Piastri is almost there. Very little has changed at the business end, but now Antonelli is at risk of a track-limits penalty. Antonelli is up to sixth for Mercedes. On time he is fifth, though, because of Tsunoda’s penalty. Russell ahead of Verstappen, Antonelli in effect ahead of Tsunoda: Mercedes stretching their advantage over Red Bull by three points. Stroll pits. Tyre change, to the softs. Using it as test session. Tsunoda gets a five-second time penalty for breaching track limits. At this stage we have no idea how the contenders will line up for tomorrow’s grid. But bearing in mind Verstappen’s fade, this is looking like good news for McLaren. If he can’t sustain pressure then the title could be down to Norris v Piastri. It’s looking very smooth for Piastri. But it’s getting windy and drivers are breaching track limits. Could this be a factor tomorrow? We are approaching halfway. But Norris has pulled clear of Verstappen for now. As Croft and Brundle keep repeating, third, third, third and Norris will be champion in Abu Dhabi. But can you really do that? Nick Faldo won the 1987 Open with 18 straight pars in the final round … Norris has lost DRS but Verstappen still too far back. A bad day for Ferrari: Charles Leclerc lost four places at the start and is down in 13th. The team’s chances of overtaking Red Bull in the constructors’ standings are diminishing. Verstappen knows he has no danger behind him, with Tsunoda in fifth ahead of Alonso. Norris has got close enough to Russell and that helps him stay clear. Norris needs to get close enough to Russell to get his own DRS. Trains are his friends. Verstappen closes on Norris at turn one but can’t get past. Piastri has pulled out a second on Russell so is safe from DRS. The key time is the one between Norris and Verstappen. Verstappen got past Tsunoda and Fernando Alonso. Lights out! Piastri away well, Russell, Norris to the first corner but Verstappen moves up to fourth. Martin Brundle is worried by gravel: there’s a lot of it about and it could threaten the medium tyres. Formation lap time. We have 19 laps of the longest circuit in F1, David Croft reminds us. The countdown is on. One point in Verstappen’s favour: his teammate Yuki Tsunoda is ahead of him by one place. He is unlikely to mess with Red Bull’s main man. Sky interviewing Sky now: Gary Neville is with Mercedes. Karun Chandhok is jumping ahead to 2026, interviewing Adrian Newey about his stepping up to Aston Martin team principal. There are only 16 cars on the grid. It was another bad qualifying for Lewis Hamilton: after coming 20th and last in Las Vegas, leading to an eighth-place finish in the grand prix, he failed to make it out of Q1 again on Friday. Ferrari have consequently made changes to his setup and so he will start from the pit lane. Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll and the Alpine duo of Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto are all doing likewise. “We take the learning for tomorrow,” says Isack Hadjar, 11th on the grid. There will be a lot of that. It’s not all about the drivers’ title: McLaren have run away with the constructors’ gong but Mercedes, with a 40-point lead over Red Bull, will be hoping to seal second place this weekend. Russell can help them achieve that from second place, and Kimi Antonelli will start just behind Verstappen. Piastri won that day – as he did last year, too. McLaren’s Australian is going for a hat-trick. Right, just over 20 minutes to go till the sprint race gets under way. Barring disaster, it’s greatest value is as an indication of what is to come, rather than significant in its own right, with only eight points available to the winner. Mind you, second place here was enough for Verstappen to become champion two years ago: Philip will be here shortly to take you through today’s sprint race (2pm GMT) and qualifying (6pm)."
sport_live_2025_nov_29_wales-v-south-africa-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-live.txt,sport,2025-11-29,Lee Calvert,Wales 0-73 South Africa: Autumn Nations Series rugby union – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/nov/29/wales-v-south-africa-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-live,"Thanks all for your company and comments. That’s the end of the Autumn fixtures, see you back here for the Six Nations. Siya Kolisi is offering thoughts “We had to fight, we respected them, we didn’t play in our half and made sure we played. I’m sure [Etzebeth] didn’t mean to do that [eye gouge] on purpose and I don’t want that to be the highlight of the game. The only way a team can get better is play the best, so next year after facing this they will be better. The Wales people are fighting people and we’ve been through this too after 2015, so it can get better.” Dan Biggar is keeping it real on TV “There are players there that aren’t at this level now, and may not play this level again. I don’t think anyone learned anything from that.” Andre Esterhuizen is the deserved Player Of The Match “We worked really hard for it so pleased to achieve the clean sweep [in the Autumn]. Whatever team we pick every guy steps up and everyone knows their role and trusts each other. In Wales you can always expect a team that never gives up and physically front up.” A total dismantling by South Africa of a callow Wales team. The Boks cement their status as the world’s top team and the size of the challenge facing the home side is a laid bare. 80 mins. There is a last attack by Wales in the Bok 5m zone, but the ball is lost forward and then despatched to touch to end a dominant win for the best in the world. 79 mins. Wales have a run in the middle third where there is a infringement by the Bok defence. There’s some niggly afters from the visitors so the ref marches them 10 more metres for dissent. It’s a straight red for the big lock. And quite right too. 78 mins. A little push and shove has kicked off in midfield with a smiling Etzebeth at the centre of it all. Alex Mann is the Wales player in the midst for the second week in a row as he as amongst it vs NZ as well. He’s rum lad the young Cardiff back row. However, a TMO replay suggests he may have reason to be aggrieved as Etzebeth has clearly rammed his thumb into the Welshman’s eye. 76 mins. A tired set in the middle of the park has the ball loose on the ground for Wales to hack it forward to start a big chase. There are plenty players within a grasp of the ball, but it ends up rolling dead. 74 mins. The scrum is a mess from Wales with Morse fumbling his pickup at the back. Possession goes back to South Africa who waste no time getting to the line for Etzebeth to score. The conversion is missed. 73 mins. One thing that Wales can take as a positive from this game is that they’ve done a great job containing every Boks maul, and they do it again here as the visitors attempt to drive over from a lineout. The Welsh get amongst it to prevent the ball coming out and win a scrum. 70 mins. More easily contained attacking patterns by Wales on halfway, this time ended by Kwagga Smith clamping on the ball at the ruck to win a penalty. 68 mins. The latest crumpling of the Welsh scrum leads to an attack on a penalty advantage that ends with a forward pass to Willemse. Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu taps the next penalty and races towards the posts where he is held up, but three phases later Nortje forces over. 65 mins. Every attack Wales attempt is snuffed out by either the Bok defence line smothering their passing, or a misdirected cross-kick option after the previously described passing effort becomes to sorrowful to attempt another time. 63 mins. Ball off the top of a lineout finds Esterhuizen on another booming crash-ball run into the Wales red zone. On the next phase the defence and sixes and sevens can do little to prevent Feinberg-Mngomezulu waltzing over. 60 mins. Lake has a run from a tap and go and is rattled by a big hit before Mann has a go himself. He runs a little too far away from his supporting clearout runners, and that split second on the ground is all Esterhuizen needs to get his hands on it to win a holding on penalty. The Boks defence celebrate like it’s a last minute win, such is their way. 58 mins. The home side are camped out on the Bok 5m line, with the visiting defence repeatedly giving away offside penalties. On the advantage Murray is found in the 13 channel and he attempts to step his way through the tackles without success. 56 mins. Wales have their best period of the game with Sheedy conducitng the attack, left and right, with some clever cross-kicks from him and Hawkins. The Bok defence is up to the task, but not without infringing at a ruck on the 22. In the run up, Wainwright was high in the tackle and his shoulder made contact with the head. He’s off and the bunker will review it. 53 mins. Every possession from the Boks in the Wales half now results in a try, pretty much. The latest is a simple draw and pass move repeated all the way left to the big centre to race over on the left touchline. 52 mins. Wales have a lineout just inside the Bok half as Rassie empties the bench and makes all eight replacements in one go. The ball is won by the home side and moved left, but there’s an understandable desperation about their passing and the final one is behind Mee and into touch. 49 mins. There is some Wales possession in the Bok half, which moves the ball left and right, but it’s very lateral and ultimately leads to the ball going to ground. This is leapt on by Moodie who boots it forward to chase to the line, gather it and score with three Welsh defenders trailing in his jetwash. 46 mins. It looks like Wales have done a good job spoiling SA possession but the ref concludes it was hands in the ruck. This gives Feinberg-Mngomezulu to quickly tap the ball and race 30 metres to the line. He converts his own score. Plumtree was offside in the run up to the try and pays the price for the consistent offside infringements by his team. 44 mins. Wales do another great job of defending a Bok maul from a lineout close to the line which forces the ball to the backs. But the effort undertaken to contain the maul means there a gaps elsewhere and Louw is over. 42 mins. Some phases with the ball in the middle third by South Africa lead to Wales being offside in defence. They are understandably attempting a big blitz, but timing was slightly off. The game is afoot once more More half-time postbag, this one from Matt Dony “The WRU should have been watching the Welsh FA closely over the last 15 years or so, and taken copious notes. The Welsh FA has made so many good decisions, put the fans first, employed the right people with the right experience, used the budget fairly across all Welsh football, just generally helped the game to flourish. Yes, I know it’s different, but the WRU haven’t done ANY of those things. And the results speak for themselves. A game against the Springboks, and the stadium is nowhere near full? It’s just another symptom of a deeper malaise. Richard Collier-Keywood boasted about how he has ‘fun in this job, every day.’ Those attached to Scarlets and Ospreys, who don’t know whether they have a future and can’t make plans, are not having fun. The fans paying extortionate prices to watch poor performances are not having fun. The whole set-up is just not good enough.” “Your tone is patronising and unfair.” says Gareth Thomas “This game was arranged when Wales were in their pomp. There has to be a rebuilding process and there is much to praise in this Autumn series.” This fixture was arranged in COVID, and there has been plenty of contracts and agreements that were decided as not needed since then. Wales have also played SA seven times since 2020, so dropping this one would not have been a hardship for anyone. Wales also finished that year losing 32-9 to Ireland, so I don’t agree with your definition of their status at that time. I agree that there are some positives from this Autumn for Wales, which I referenced in the preamble as being another reason why this fixture was a stupid idea given it was always likely to be this way. Now the last fixture of the series is an utter pasting This game has nothing to do with a rebuilding process and everything to do with the WRU being utterly dreadful at their job. PEEEEEEP! That’s last act of an entirely expected half of rugby. 40+3 mins. An absolutely massive carry by Esterhuizen clatters to within a metre and two short phases later the scrum half is over to score. 40+1 mins. South African rampage 80 metres back the other way and are hammering away at the Wales line. The ball is fumbled, but the defence were offside and so the visitors will go again before half time. 39 mins. A strong maul in the middle of park by Wales is followed by a good claim of a kick chase by Dyer. The ball is fizzed to Edwards who tries to locate Mee in acres of space on the right with a cross-kick. It’s overcooked and Mee can only screw his attempt to volley it into touch. 38 mins. A Boks catch and drive inside the 22 is held still by Wales, which forces the visitors to move it out to the backs. They move it all the way to the right where Willemse joins the line out wide, but a double tackle from Roberts and Dyer stops him and forces a penalty. 35 mins. The lineout, the one thing that has functioned for Wales in this game, chooses now to go haywire with Lake overthrowing Mann at the tail. The loose ball is pounced on by Edwards but his team mates are penalised for sealing off when they arrive to assist him. 33 mins. WALES HAVE WON A SCRUM PENALTY! Blow the whistle, stop the count, end the game, etc, for surely it cannot get better than this. 22m lineout for Wales incoming. 30 mins. Kolisi has a dart at the line from short metres after another imperious march into the Wales 5m area from his forwards. The captain is held up short and the ball is flung wide towards Hooker but it drifts forward. There was an advantage being played however, and South Africa take the scrum option and snowplough Wales off their path for Wiese to dot it down. 28 mins. The plan for Wales on their own scrum is to get the ball in quick then boot it back to Wainwright to pick up as quick as he can. This has worked well twice now, and the latest version here allows Hardy to clear the ball. 26 mins. Excellent maul defence from Wales at the lineout forces it to the ground where the ball is trapped in. Wales must now weather a head and feed scrum on their own 5m line. 24 mins. Another scrum, another total folding of the Wales pack leads to a penalty. There is an attempt to run the advantage, but it comes to nothing, so SA set up for a 5m lineout. 22 mins. Wales have their best couple of minutes of the game with a well won lineout leading to an attack in the SA half. The ball is fizzed around before a clever kick from Murray puts Willemse under some pressure; that is immediately relived when Murray get his arms too high in the tackle and catches the Bok fullback’s head. 19 mins. South Africa are warming up now, with Feinberg-Mngomezulu to the fore dancing through a gap and finding Kolisi with an offload. The ball is recycled quickly on the 22, but Esterhuizen can’t hold the next pass. Wales quickly fish the ball out of the resulting scrum and send the ball away via the boot. 17 mins. The ball is fumbled forward by a Wales hand on the restart, which means another scrum for Wales to survive. It takes a while to set before eventually the ref awards a free kick against SA for early engagement. Small victories. 14 mins. Another Bok scrum puts a lot of pressure on the Wales pack, but this time on the penalty advantage they move to the blind side, with Feinberg-Mngomezulu drifting across the defence. His lateral movement creates a two-on-one out wide that Hooker takes advantage of. Another two points added. 11 mins. Wales defended that SA set pretty well, which I know sounds daft seeing as they conceded a try, but the organisation and physicality was good for large parts of it. There’s some more positives for the home side when Hawkins and Roberts combine in midfield to very nearly create a chance for Mee to have run up the touchline. The pass from Roberts is just behind the winger, however. 9 mins. The visitors are up to double figures phases of punishing carries in the Wales 22, and the inevitable comes when the big prop crashes over with a run from three metres. Two points added from the tee. 6 mins. It’s taken six minutes, but the first scrum penalty is awarded against Wales after the Boks drop the hammer and shove the Welsh pack back to Bridgend, splintering it along the way. 4 mins. Two passes are all that’s needed from the Boks to get Moodie running outside Mee on the blindside . The SA winger then completely airswipes his attempt to kick the ball forward to start a foot race with the retreating defence which cues some laughs from the crowd. Gotta take your fun where you can find it at Wales games these days… 2 mins. Wales have the first lineout of the game on their own 22 after Willemse finds touch. Lake fires it long over the top to Mann running, but it comes to little and the ball is kicked away by Hardy. Dan Edwards boots the ball high to get us underway. Our man in the stadium, Michael Aylwin, has this “The Principality Stadium is not full. They reckon on about 50,000. The roof is closed and the Welsh anthem ringing out with the usual gusto. Come back at full-time to check the latest update on the health of Welsh rugby” The teams are out into the covered stadium in Cardiff. There are lots of empty seats as the teams settle in for the pre-match formalities. Pre match reading Have a read of Dan Gallan’s reflections on the November just gone As you can tell, I’m not happy with the WRU. You may have a different view and you can share that, or anything else with me on the email. The big selection news is that Rassie Erasmus has gone back to his patented 7-1 bench, with scrum-half Cobus Reinach the only back selected as cover. The Wales bench has a total of 39 caps, while the Boks have 359. This is just one example of the experience gap between the two teams, and that’s before you consider the ability gap. The game could be a good development experience for the unfledged home squad, but it could also get very messy. Wales Blair Murray; Ellis Mee, Joe Roberts, Joe Hawkins, Rio Dyer; Dan Edwards, Kieran Hardy; Gareth Thomas, Dewi Lake, Keiron Assiratti, Ben Carter; Rhys Davies, Taine Plumtree, Alex Mann, Aaron Wainwright. Replacements: Brodie Coghlan, Danny Southworth, Chris Coleman, James Ratti, Morgan Morse, Reuben Morgan-Williams, Callum Sheedy, Ben Thomas. South Africa Damian Willemse; Ethan Hooker, Damian de Allende, Andre Esterhuizen, Canan Moodie; Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu, Morne van den Berg; Gerhard Steenekamp, Johan Grobbelaar, Wilco Louw; Jean Kleyn, Ruan Nortje; Siya Kolisi, Franco Mostert, Jasper Wiese. Replacements: Bongi Mbonambi, Zachary Porthen, Asenathi Ntlabakanye, Eben Etzebeth, Marco van Staden, Ben-Jason Dixon, Kwagga Smith, Cobus Reinach It is tempting at this point to describe the Welsh Rugby Union as a clown show. But that would unfairly overlook the commitment and dedication, training, expertise, and preparation to produce that circus based entertainment. The public also respects clowns, even the ones that oddly fear them. The WRU are more like a Baboons On LSD show. Wherein a large group of hallucinating monkeys run about screaming, break everything in the building then start viciously eating each other, with little regard for the paying audience. The latest symptom of this corporate approach from the custodian of the game of rugby union in Wales is today’s match. Scheduled as it is outside the agreed international window, this means that an already challenged Wales team is shorn of its non-Wales based players, while the nation’s domestic pro clubs are having to field teenagers and rugby pensioners in league games on the same day. But wait, it gets worse. The national side are also having to play against the most powerful force in world rugby at present, as the Springboks arrive in Cardiff having put every team they’ve faced this November through their industrial shredder. This is all the more galling in the context of the Wales vs New Zealand match last week, a performance of small comforts from the men in red when all expected a walloping for the ages. Well, barring a miracle, that’s what coming today while in the domestic United Rugby Championship, the pro clubs of Cymru face their own daunting tasks. So, an egregious example of rugby governance and planning all round from the national union. The players and public have been shamefully let down for the best part of a decade (and more) and the scenario this weekend is the crowning top hat full of turds that exemplifies the whole mess. At this point, it might actually be worth letting the baboons have a go. How much worse could it be?"
sport_live_2025_nov_30_formula-one-qatar-grand-prix-2025-live-updates-norris-piastri-verstappen-f1.txt,sport,2025-11-30,Luke McLaughlin,F1: Verstappen wins Qatar GP as three-way title race goes to Abu Dhabi finale – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/nov/30/formula-one-qatar-grand-prix-2025-live-updates-norris-piastri-verstappen-f1,"Giles Richards’ race report is here: Thanks a lot for reading and for all the emails. That was a terrible race in many ways, but for all that, I will be tuning in for the season finale next week given the potential for drama … it’s a funny old game. Good night. “David Coulthard even said yesterday that if there was a safety car early, everyone would pit,” emails Kevin. ”They should’ve watched Channel 4 highlights. Marginal gains.” “It’s tough,” says Norris. “We have to have faith in the team. It was a gamble. Now it’s the wrong decision. We didn’t do a good job today … not our finest day but that’s life. “It’s nothing to do with the team trying to play fair [by treating both drivers the same]. Nothing to do with it. Everyone goes on about that. “Red Bull did a better job as a team. They made the right call. We know why we didn’t make the right decision. You can’t get them all right. If the team does their job, and I do mine, we’ll be fine.” “It’s a disappointing result overall,” says Andrea Stella of McLaren. “We lost the victory with Oscar and the podium with Lando, definitely not what we wanted. We have to review the decision during the safety car on lap seven “It was a decision not to pit. We didn’t expect everyone else to pit. It would have been the right decision to pit, when you are the lead car, you don’t know what everyone else is going to do. “It was a decision. As a matter of fact, it wasn’t the correct decision. “The [potential] flexibility was – any other safety car would put us in a very strong position. “It worked well for everyone, stopping at lap seven. That’s what it is. We thought the pace in the car might allow us to open enough of a gap. We could not exploit the pace of the car. Not the desired outcome. “You need to have a plan for the safety car. When it’s so late in a lap, it doesn’t give you a chance … but it’s not an excuse. “We understand Oscar being extremely disappointed. He’s been fast, solid, consistent, he’s done everything right. Likewise Lando. We want to keep the options open for all our drivers. “It is still in our hands. It comes down to the quality of our work … we will go very determined into the finale of this season.” “I was thinking,” emails Michael. (That’s always dangerous, by the way.) “ … McLaren must have a plan, a strategy where they valued having their cars in P1 and P2 more than the pit stop. Surely there is a plan, right? “Narrator voice: “There was no plan.” “If one were of a conspiracy mindset, a grand choreographing of this and the previous race would seem eminently plausible,” writes Darryl. “A big fix taking the title fight to the final race all for “entertainment” value? Or of course one could just put it all down to the sheer stupidity that McLaren and their drivers have shown at crucial points all season.” “Looking like another F1 stitch up in Abu Dhabi to me,” emails John. “Discuss.” Oh, I am sure they (we?) will. “And the dorsal fin is right behind McLaren,” emails Joris van Wijk. Norris 408pts Verstappen 396pts Piastri 392pts “I’m so happy,” says Carlos Sainz of Williams. “So proud of the whole team. We came into this weekend thinking it would be the most difficult of the year … I was super quick. We nailed the pace, the start, the strategy, I could not be more proud. We got everything right today. We improved in so many areas. There were opportunities today and we grabbed all of them. I am over the moon.” Piastri has a chat: “We didn’t get it right tonight. I drove the best race I could, as fast as I could, it wasn’t to be tonight. “In hindsight it’s pretty obvious what we would have done [under the safety car]. We’ll discuss it as a team. “It’s been a good weekend, the pace has been strong, it’s a little bit tough to swallow at the moment.” “This was an incredible race for us,” says Verstappen. “We made the right call as a team under the safety car. Super happy to win. We stay in the fight to the end. Incredible. For us it was a very strong race. It was a tough weekend.” “That’s an interesting move,” Verstappen adds of McLaren’s decision not to pit under the early safety car. “I knew then we had a bit of a gap … still, you have to keep the tyres alive. “It’s all possible now. We’ll see. I don’t really worry about it too much.” So Verstappen, going into Abu Dhabi, is 12pts down on Norris. “I would love to be in the McLaren debrief,” says Karun Chandhok. This all feels pretty terrible for McLaren. It’s going to be a tough week. Verstappen Piastri Sainz Norris Antonelli Russell Alonso Leclerc Lawson Tsunoda Albon Hamilton Bortoleto Colapinto Ocon Gasly Stroll Hadjar Bearman Hulkenberg “Speechless,” says Piastri. “I don’t have any words.” He ain’t happy. And quite rightly. “Not sure what happened to Antonelli, Max … it looks like he just pulled over and let him through,” says someone on the Red Bull team of Norris taking fourth. “Regardless of that we will fight to the end. Well done Max.” “Well done on the strategy,” says Verstappen. “That’s a very lovely race, well done everyone,” says Verstappen. His third consecutive win in Qatar. Lap 57/57: Norris moves up to fourth after Antonelli runs wide! That could be big. Lap 56/57: An email titled: “Re. F1 going downhill” “I think you’ve hit upon an idea there!” writes Dan. “Works for skiing anyway.” Lap 55/57: Verstappen Piastri +9.9sec Sainz Antonelli Norris Russell Alonso Leclerc Lawson Tsunoda Lap 54/57: The commentators are starting to discuss permutations for the final race. Norris is down in fifth. Verstappen is 10.9sec ahead of Piastri in second. Norris has eight second places, which may prove important in certain scenarios. Lap 53/57: F1 may well have been going downhill since 1979. But then again, who hasn’t? Lap 53/57: “It may well be that 1mm wear on a skid block costs Norris the championship,” emails Richard. “Results changed long after the race. This is not a spectator sport. “Maybe standing on the penultimate corner at Dijon in 1979 raised my expectations, but F1 has been going downhill ever since.” Lap 52/57: The top five – Verstappen Piastri +12sec Sainz +10sec Antonelli +2.7sec Norris +.5sec Lap 51/57: So in fairness, Piastri is shaving time off Verstappen’s lead, but six more laps isn’t going to be enough to make a difference. Norris is still in fifth. Lap 50/57: Piastri has reduced the gap to 12.9sec. Lap 48/57: Norris is in fifth, after his second stop, trying to get past Sainz. Verstappen leads by 14.3sec. He is home and hosed unless something astonishing happens. “Just use your pace now,” Piastri is told. This is ludicrous. They (McLaren) have completely messed this up. The commentators have been trying their best to maintain interest, and have farcically been hoping for another safety car to spice things up. “If the race finished now, Verstappen would be 10 points behind Norris in the title race,” says Brundle. Lap 47/57: “I gave up F1 a while ago,” writes Tim. “The new tracks are designed by the same guy and are similar and boring. The business seems to hate the old fun demanding tracks.” Lap 45/57: Now Verstappen, Norris and Piastri have all pitted twice. The F1 website says they are all on medium tyres, to perhaps the info about hard tyres for Piastri was wrong? Lap 45/57: “Could the McLarens do the same thing teams do in Monaco,” emails Michael. “Norris slows down so Piastri can pit, and then reverse?” An F1 car cannot reverse. (joking!) Lap 43/57: Piastri comes in for hard tyres. That’s hard tyres. A 1.8sec stop. Norris leads. Then Verstappen. Then Piastri. “OK Max,” Verstappen is told on radio. “It’s Oscar who is pitted early, and is looking to chase you down now.” THE RACE IS ON! (Or is it?) Lap 42/57: Piastri is plotting something on the radio with him team. Are they going to pit and put soft tyres on? Lap 41/57: Surely it would have been common sense for McLaren to pit if literally everyone else in the race pitted during the safety car? Even a relative F1 ignoramus like me can see that. Lap 40/57: The Sky commentators have admitted defeat, and pointed out that Verstappen is going to win. You were all well ahead of the game with your emails, so well done. Lap 39/57: “The races are becoming more about technical errors than real racing,” emails Gordon. “We need more tracks where the drivers have a chance of really fighting for position and fewer that are predetermined by qualifying order barring penalties and poor pit lane decisions. It’s getting boring.” Yes. Top 10 right now: Oscar Piastri Lando Norris +7sec Max Verstappen +2sec Carlos Sainz George Russell Kimi Antonelli Fernando Alonso Isack Hadjar Charles Leclerc Lance Stroll Lap 37/57: “This is the bit of the race where we need to be quicker than Max,” McLaren’s drivers are told over the radio. Which may be easier said than done. Piastri Norris +4.7sec Verstappen +8.1sec Sainz +27sec Antonelli +33sec Lap 33/57: LOADS of cars pitted just then. It looked like George Russell came close to a shunt of some kind as one of the Racing Bulls came in past him just as he finished his stop. Ted Kravitz says Russell in fact came close to hitting someone in the pit lane. Perhaps the stewards will have a look at it. Lap 32/57: “Good afternoon,” writes Bill Preston, which seems a fair enough opening gambit. “With all the massive costs involved in the design and construction of modern racing tracks, surely there’s employment enough for someone to say “There isn’t sufficient space or safety margin with what we have for drivers to get stomp on and then with style, panache, and thrilling heroics have a several way tussle for the lead”? “At least Monaco has boats and stuff. “I hope Norris does well, but won’t begrudge Verstappen a win. “Yours, grumpily …” Lap 32/57: Lando Norris has been notified about breaching track limits twice. One more and he gets an official warning, two more and it’s a five-second penalty. (Says the expert, Brundle.) Meanwhile, Verstappen is going to pit … Lap 30/57: “Thanks for the coverage - my only channel to follow the F1 unbiased,” writes Peter. “It looks like McLaren’s strategic mishap will make Abu Dabi the F1 thriller of the year, like it was with Lewis and Max having all to play for.” Yes, it’s shaping up to be a Verstappen v Hamilton thriller, like the 2021 vintage. Lap 28/57: Verstappen leads. Verstappen +14.8sec Sainz Antonelli Piastri Norris Lap 26/57: Norris pits, a quick one at 2.2sec. He reemerges on to the track, and only just holds off Alonso! Norris is fifth. Alonso sixth. “That brings McLaren back into play a little bit,” insists Brundle. Lap 25/57: Piastri pits. Norris leads. Piastri has gone to medium tyres. Lap 24/57: “Max is a fierce defender, and McLaren may have just made a massive blunder,” emails Ian. “I can somewhat see the argument they wanted to make, but with these tyre limits, it simply wasn’t the right call. The Dutch Lion may stay in this championship race til the end.” Lap 23/57: Keep the emails coming. Tell me your views! Lap 23/57: “If Norris wins he’s the champion!” says Croft on commentary. That is a big if, based on what we’re looking at. Lap 21/57: “However much excitement Croft and Brundle try to manufacture from this, the result seems clear to me. Verstappen will win,” emails James. “The McLarens need to stop twice. Verstappen, and everyone else, only need to stop once more. Given races at this track are always a procession, all Verstappen has to do is manage his tyres and stay within 25 seconds of the McLarens. After all stops he’ll be ahead on a track that’s notoriously difficult to pass on.” Lap 20/57: I mean sure, you can argue there is intrigue in tyre and pitstop strategy, but the emphasis on it illustrates the sheer lack of drama elsewhere in this race. I sincerely hope I eat my words and it’s exciting at the end, but as it stands, Verstappen overtaking Norris into turn one is as thrilling as it’s going to get. Lap 19/57: “Max is going to win today. Total pit-stop blunder by McLaren,” emails Ulrich. “Will they never learn?” Lap 17/57: The only cars in the race who have not pitted are the McLarens. “A safety car in the next seven or eight laps would take a lot of pressure off the McLaren situation,” says Brundle. It seems a bit farcical that none of this is about actual driving skill. Lap 16/57: Leclerc is ninth, Hamilton is 14th. It’s another poor weekend for the Ferraris who have struggled throughout. Lap 15/57: Gasly is back in the race after that crash. But it’s an early bath for Hulkenberg. Lap 13/57: Top 10 – Piastri +2sec Norris Verstappen Sainz Antonelli Alonso Hadjar Russell Leclerc Bearman Lap 12/57: Up front, Piastri leads by 1.2sec and seems to be pulling away from his teammate Norris. “The teams are limited on 25 laps each for each set of tyres,” explains Brundle. “McLaren have to get rid of these medium tyres at lap 25, they have to get everything out of them before that.” Lap 10/57: So Norris is now second to Piastri following Verstappen’s pitstop during the safety car. The received wisdom is that the safety car has worked out horribly for McLaren. “It feels to me that McLaren have missed a trick,” says Brundle on commentary. What do you think? Email me. Lap 10/57: McLaren have chosen not to pit during the safety car. Verstappen did, and has medium tyres on, that are two laps old right now. “Expect the McLarens to push hard after the restart” Verstappen is told over the radio. Hulkenberg’s car is being hauled off the track now. The safety car is about to end. Lap 9/57: Gasly was right on Hulkenberg’s tail into the corner. Hulkenberg’s rear right corner was clipped by Gasly’s front left wing. “I can’t believe this,” Hulkenberg says on the radio. *expletive bleeped out* “Unbelievable. I gave [Gasly] him loads of space.” Hulkenberg and Gasly have had a coming together by turn two. Hulkenberg of Sauber is out of the race. Gasly is limping to the pits. The safety car is out. Verstappen comes into the pits and he’s not the only one … Lap 7/57: Piastri’s lead is up to 2.6sec. Lap 5/57: Piastri leads by 2.1sec now. Norris is 4sec down in third. We are going to witness a processional win for Piastri unless something unexpected happens. Lap 3/57: The top 10 – Piastri +2sec Verstappen Norris Antonelli Sainz Alonso Russell Hadjar Gasly Hulkenburt Lap 2/57: Piastri leads by 1.5sec. He’ll be extremely happy that the ball in his court. No major errors from here and he knows, barring events beyond his control such as mechanicals, that the title race is going down to Abu Dhabi next week. Piastri leads, a perfect start. Verstappen takes second from Norris, who looks quick off the mark, but ultimately gets a relatively poor start. Verstappen overtaking Norris into turn one could be very significant … Formation lap done. Cars are ready, while Franco Colapinto heads for the pits to start from there. David Beckham and Gary Neville are here, too! Anyway, the cars are out on track. We are seconds away from lights out. Here’s how they line up: Oscar Piastri Lando Norris Max Verstappen George Russell Kimi Antonelli Isack Hadjar Carlos Sainz Fernando Alonso Pierre Gasly Charles Leclerc Nico Hulkenberg Liam Lawson Oliver Bearman Alexander Albon Yuki Tsunoda Esteban Ocon Lewis Hamilton Lance Stroll Gabriel Bortoleto Franco Colapinto It’s a 57-lap race. The race has been won from pole twice out of the three that have been run since 2021. Gordon Ramsay, the uber-celebrity chef, reckons it’s in the bag for Norris tonight, and he can enjoy his title next weekend. “The drivers need to focus on what they control, which is turn one,” says pundit Jamie Chadwick. Will it be another P1 for Piastri? “I sure hope so, that’s the plan,” he says. How are things between him and teammate Norris? “I mean, the same as always … we are fighting for a win, and a championship, we’ll race each other like we always have done.” How is Norris feeling? “Feeling all good,” he says cheerfully, striding past Brundle. “This could be ugly,” emails Bill. “Norris isn’t the greatest starter in the world, and he and Piastri could take each other out on the first corner. It wouldn’t surprise me. Plus, Verstappen will have his elbows out so far, they’ll be like wings. His aggressiveness gets to Norris at the best of times. But if Lando can get away cleanly, then the race and probably the championship are his. That certainly seems to be what the team wants. So maybe a strategically sloppy pitstop for Piastri? Nah … they would never do that.” Thanks Bill. How is Max Verstappen? “All good. Like always.” You always look so relaxed, says Brundle. Are there any nerves? “Not at all. Just want to have a good time out there. Hopefully we’ll have a good one. We’ll do our best.” Better to be the hunter than the hunted, I suppose. “Very good! Excited!” says Novak Djokovic, when asked how he is. Has he been sending some tennis balls down to Zak Brown? “Yes I have. He’s been good! He’s been terrific! “He’s been very relaxed, but now it’s about laser focus … I’m trying to soak it all in, the energy is incredible.” Are there things he can take from F1 to tennis? “The first thing that strikes me is, how well it’s organised, how many things that are combined with sport and entertainment, to leave everybody speechless.” And with that he’s gone. “I’m so happy to be here,” says Maya Jama, before revealing she was obliged to wear trainers on the grid due to a ban on open-toed shoes. “I’m with Red Bull today, hopefully we can make it to No 1, but we’ll see.” “Good luck to everyone, hopefully it’s decided tonight… what an event, what an occasion. These are the things you can do when you’re retired,” says Steven Gerrard to Brundle. “I wouldn’t want anyone near me in the tunnel before a big game,” Rio Ferdinand adds of the drivers rubbing shoulders on the start/finish straight. “But these guys are used to it.” “The Netflix documentary opened so many eyes, including my own,” says the actor and comedian Kevin Hart of ‘Drive to Survive’. “It’s wonderful to be here.” John Brewin has West Ham v Liverpool here, by the way: If Norris outscores his teammate Piastri by four points, he’s the champ. Who could forget 2021, when Hamilton v Verstappen went right down to the wire? The famous Martin Brundle grid walk is coming right up! “I have pipped Oscar Piastri throughout,” says the Sky Sports F1 commentator David Croft of the possible destiny of this season’s drivers’ title. “You know what a stubborn old man I am. I’m not changing now.” Monaco, Las Vegas, Singapore. The list of pitstops on Lando Norris’ road to the top of Formula One is like a luxury travel agent’s catalogue. So when I was asked to trace the young man’s journey ahead of a weekend in which he could become the first British champion driver since Lewis Hamilton, my hopes were high. As the taxi pulled up outside the Clay Pigeon Raceway in Dorchester, however, my excitement was taken down a few gears. It may seem an inauspicious place to blood the talent of those who will become some of the most glamorous, fiery competitors in sport, but here, in the shadow of an industrial estate not far from Yeovil, is where a growing number of Formula One stars are made. Mathematically, Norris could finish as low as eighth and still be champion. But we are unlikely to need permutations that complex. Personally I think Norris looks and sounds pretty chilled, and he remains confident of sealing the title, despite the drama of last week’s disqualification. You can feast your eyes on yesterday’s sprint race and qualifying blog here: Zak Brown, McLaren CEO, says it’s “business as usual”. Max Verstappen, meanwhile, said something about trying to get the best possible start. What do you think will happen today? You can email me. Lando Norris will be world champion for the first time if he wins today. Though given the drama of recent weeks, most notably the disqualification of both McLarens from the Las Vegas GP, it would be little surprise if the drivers’ title goes down to the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi next week. More importantly for the destiny of the title, Piastri won yesterday’s sprint race, trimming Norris’s title lead to 22 points and taking pole position: so he is strongly fancied to take the chequered flag later. Max Verstappen of Red Bull isn’t out of contention, either, but will need the cards to fall in his favour. We can dig into the permutations a bit more but if Norris is at least 25 points ahead of Max Verstappen in a few hours, and 26 or more in front of his teammate Oscar Piastri, he is champion … could we see a new name on that illustrious list today? Lights out: 4pm UK time."

I’m really glad we got another upset after all the shocks midweek. The Panthers couldn’t look like more of a different team than the rabble that flopped against the 49ers on Monday. Nice to see Bryce Young pull off a huge win, maybe we might start seeing a few more of them as he continues to develop. Enjoy the rest of night’s action if you are staying locked in, goodnight! I’ll just leave you with another view of that frankly ridiculous Puka Nacua catch. It’s GOOD! Jets 27-24 Falcons, final score NICK FOLK! The walkoff 56-yard field goal seals the win for the Jets. They never held the lead in this one until the very last second. What an effort. Wow he only just made it, but they all count! Jets now 3-9 and the Falcons are 4-8. Atlanta really struggling this season despite having a solid roster. Dolphins 21-17 Saints, Titans 3-25 Jaguars, final scores So about that Cam Ward breakout game. The Titans lose a seventh in succession while the Jags leap to the top of the AFC South. The rookie QB finished 24/38 with 141 yards, no TDs, no picks. That is an average of 3.7 yards per completion. Yikes. Colts 16-20 Texans, final score Indy drop to 8-4 and are about to lose top spot in their division with the Jags about to win. Fourth straight W for Houston will feel great for Texans fans with CJ Stroud back in the lineup. They are 7-5 just one game back on the Colts and Jags in the AFC South. Browns 8-26 49ers, final score Routine win for San Fran that feels that bit more special with the Rams losing. They are 9-4 now after a third win in succession. TOUCHDOWN! Jets 24-24 Falcons 1:11, 4th quarter Tyrod Taylor tucks and runs for a 10-yard score. Jets keep fighting back they are yet to take a lead in this one but are on the ball again now. TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 17-21 Saints 1:46, 4th quarter Oh dear. Tyler Shough drives the Saints to the verge of drawing level with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Devaughn Vele. And then with the two-point try he throws a pick that is returned for a score by Minkah Fitzpatrick. Hard luck for the rookie. So near and yet so very, very far. Buccaneers 20-17 Cardinals, final score The 7-5 Bucs snap their three-game losing run to stay top of the NFC South. They really needed that with the Panthers winning as well. Carolina snapping at their heels. Colts 16-20 Texans 1:51, 4th quarter Indy are on the ball with a crucial 3rd down upcoming. Nine yards to get. And the receiver gets very lucky not to fumble. He makes the catch and immediately drops it inexplicably when he would have moved the chains. Josh Downs will be kicking himself for making such an easy catch look very difficult. The Colts go for it on 4th down and the ball bounces off Josh Pittman’s hands. Looks like curtains for them, The upset is complete. Carolina win 31-28 and move to 7-6 while LA dip to 9-3, level with Chicago at the top of NFC. Seattle can move alongside those two with a win over the hapless Minnesota Vikings later too. The Panthers established the run and had faith in Bryce Young’s arm on two huge touchdowns on 4th down. Impressive stuff. It’s GOOD! Dolphins 19-11 Saints 6:01, 4th quarter Irish kicker Charlie Smyth boots it through from 56 yards out to make his first field goal in the NFL. The 24-year-old used to play Gaelic football before switching sports and going through the International player programme. Wow! Carolina have an excellent shot at pulling off an epic upset. Derrick Brown pulls off an incredible sack/fumble and scoops it upw. Three turnovers from Stafford today. That catch. How? It’s GOOD! Colts 16-20 Texans 8:41, 4th quarter Mike Badgley draws Indy a little closer with a 42-yard field goal. Panthers 31-28 Rams 5:01, 4th quarter LA are marching down field and into enemy territory after chain-moving passes to Colby Parkinson and Davante Adams. My, oh my! The Panthers gamble on 4th down again and HIT again! They risk it all for a second time and it works a treat. Tetairoa McMillan this time races by his defender and jogs in. Perfect throw from Bryce Young on the 43-yard score. Young is having a day with 196 yards and three touchdowns. TOUCHDOWN! Colts 13-20 Texans 7:51, 4th quarter Blocking, just sublime blocking. Nico Collins takes the carry on a reverse and has two men bounce defenders this way and that allowing Collins to walk in from seven yards out. Boos rain down. Fans not happy with struggles against their AFC South rivals. If the Colts do lose they look like they could fall a lot deeper with a rough schedule and the Jags and Texans coming into form. Houston would have a four-game winning streak with a W here while Jacksonville look set to make it three in a row, The Rams regain the lead! Kyren Williams races in from seven yards but that scoring drive was all about Puka Nacua. He is something else. There are one-handed grabs and there are Nacua one-handed grabs. The ball comes in and he snags it overhand, sort of plucks it out of the air for a 30-yard gain. Struggling to understand the physics of that one. Magic. Carolina Panthers 24-21 Los Angeles Rams Cleveland Browns 8-17 San Francisco 49ers Indianapolis Colts 13-13 Houston Texans Miami Dolphins 16-8 New Orleans Saints New York Jets 14-14 Atlanta Falcons Tampa Bay Buccaneers 17-10 Arizona Cardinals Tennessee Titans 3-25 Jacksonville Jaguars Just watching Jets kicker Nick Folk miss his first field goal of the season. Lot’s of empty seats at MetLife Stadium. Understandable. TOUCHDOWN! Titans 3-25 Jaguars 6:54, 3rd quarter Bhayshul Tuten gives the Jags a big, big lead with a banger up the gut for two yards. Jacksonville can go top of the AFC South with a win here and if the Colts lose. 13-13 still in Indy. TOUCHDOWN! Colts 13-13 Texans 2:51, 3rd quarter Indy draw level with a 12-yard touchdown from Daniel Jones to Tyler Warren. The rookie tight end is having a superb start to life in the NFL. That is his fourth touchdown of the season and is on pace to break the 1,000 yard mark. TOUCHDOWN! Browns 8-17 49ers 1:29, 3rd quarter Brock Purdy romps in on a keeper for the two-yard touchdown. San Francisco taking care of business while their rival Rams at the top of the NFC West are behind. 49ers fans very happy as it stands. Panthers 24-21 Rams 2:57, 3rd quarter Sadly the high-scoring action looks likely to slow down. It is absolutely pelting down in Charlotte. A running back’s dream. TOUCHDOWN! Buccaneers 17-3 Cardinals 3:56, 3rd quarter Bucky Irving is back with a bang! His first score of the season is a 13-yard scamper out to the left. Tampa on the way to breaking a three-game losing streak. TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 16-8 Saints 10:40, 3rd quarter Tyler Shough gets the Saints on the board with a 17-yard strike to Chris Olave. He runs in an easy two-point conversion too. TOUCHDOWN! Jets 14-14 Falcons 8:58, 3rd quarter Tyrod Taylor digs in his back for his driver and hits an absolute beauty straight up the fairway. Adoni Mitchell is wide open on the goal line after the harrying defender falls over. He makes the grab and falls into the end zone. Huge 52-yard throw from Taylor right on the money. PUNT! Panthers 24-21 Rams 7:18, 3rd quarter Houston, we have a punt or rather Los Angeles. I have a history of putting my foot in it and have done so again. Immediately after saying Carolina are struggling with Stafford and company they force a three and out. TOUCHDOWN! Jets 7-14 Falcons 9:41, 3rd quarter Bijan Robinson is running all over the Jets. He scores with a brilliant jump cut out to the left. Absolutely cooks the defender who is helpessly stranded on the turf as Robinson glides by for a five-yard touchdown. Robinson has 103 yards on 15 carries. Strong. What a game this is turning out to be. Carolina are back out on offense and moving the ball steadily. Nothing special. Until. Until they roll the dice big on 4th down. Jalen Coker speeds by his man on the right sideline and takes the catch for a 33-yard touchdown. Gutsy play but you have to risk it for the biscuit. Especially when the defense can’t land a glove on the Rams outside of two big interceptions. Bit of a slow burn so far minus the barnburner in Carolina. The scores: Carolina Panthers 17-21 Los Angeles Rams Cleveland Browns 8-10 San Francisco 49ers Indianapolis Colts 6-10 Houston Texans Miami Dolphins 16-0 New Orleans Saints New York Jets 7-7 Atlanta Falcons Tampa Bay Buccaneers 10-3 Arizona Cardinals Tennessee Titans 3-18 Jacksonville Jaguars Looks like my hopes of a Tennessee upset are falling rather flat. Cam Ward is averaging about four yards per play compared to Trevor Lawrence’s 12. Woah. It is all popping off as a fight breaks out on the sideline. A late hit from Arden Key on Lawrence sparks the melee. Key is penalised for roughing the passer. Little boots a field goal through from 45 yards. TOUCHDOWN! Jets 7-7 Falcons 0:09, 2nd quarter Atlanta are finally on the board with a one-yard score from Tyler Allgeier. It’s GOOD! Browns 8-10 49ers, half-time There is a gale blowing in Cleveland. Matt Gay has some help from the post to give San Francisco the lead at the break. The refs didn’t seem sure whether it had gone in but he ball blasts the post and goes through from 25 yards out. TOUCHDOWN! Panthers 14-21 Rams 1:55, 2nd quarter It is raining points in Carolina. Blake Corum this time blasts up the middle for a two-yard score. Well, you can’t throw it to Adams EVERY time can you. Variety is the spice of life. Not a lot of defense being played the possession chart reads: touchdown, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown, field goal, touchdown. The punters have their feet up, nice work if you can get it. TOUCHDOWN! Colts 6-10 Texans 5:01, 2nd quarter Nick Chubb blasts in from four yards to hand Houston the lead back. Nice to see the veteran bruiser still making plays. TOUCHDOWN! Browns 8-7 49ers 0:39, 2nd quarter Strong second start for Shedeur Sanders who uncorks a 34-yard deep ball to Harold Fannin. Quinshon Judkins just makes the two-pointer. TOUCHDOWN! Buccaneers 10-0 Cardinals 1:48, 2nd quarter Drama in Tampa. A touchdown is chalked off after a holding penalty on Payne Durham. He already had his man beat but needlessly grabs him. Bucky Irving, who walked the ball in, will not slightly peeved by his lineman. Speaking of linemen … Baker Mayfield moves the Bucs back to the goal line and Tristan Wirfs lines up as an eligible receiver. The big man kicks out the left and makes the grab! Two-yard touchdown. It’s GOOD! Panthers 17-14 Rams 5:31, 2nd quarter Ryan Fitzgerald ties a bow on a monster 7min 12sec drive with a 33-yard boot. Carolina leading arguably the best team in the NFL. A big bounce back after looking very shabby on offense last week. Bryce Young is 6/9 for 73 yards, one score and no picks. Solid. TOUCHDOWN! Colts 7-3 Texans 8:51, 2nd quarter It was a rather rough watch for offensive gurus in Indy for a minute there. The Colts turn it over on downs and CJ Stroud on the very next play throws an interception. Daniel Jones rights the ship on his next drive with a 19-yard strike to Alec Pierce. Panthers 14-14 Rams 10:11, 2nd quarter Lovely bit of playcalling by Carolina to move them into the red zone. Bryce Young fakes the toss to Chuba Hubbard and scrambles for 24 yards. He is laughing his head off, doesn’t get easier than that, not a defender in sight. TOUCHDOWN! Panthers 14-14 Rams 12:51, 2nd quarter The Stafford/Adams roadshow is back on! The QB hits his man from seven yards out to deliver the receiver’s 14th score of the season. Leads the league in touchdown receptions. Quite the comeback at 32 after some slightly down seasons with the Raiders and Jets. Colts 0-3 Texans 13:12, 2nd quarter Little of note in this one so far. Star Colts cornerback Sauce Gardner has exited with an injury. TOUCHDOWN! Titans 3-15 Jaguars 14:45, 2nd quarter Jacksonville are looking very good so far after Trevor Lawrence throws another touchdown. Brenton Strange makes the nine-yard grab. The Jags go for two and get it on a Lawrence keeper. The Titans may feel a little aggrieved after giving the ball up on a fumble. The runner was judged to be down by contact. The Jags challenged and it was overturned. Looked probably the right call but still tough to take after the refs erred on the side of caution at first. TOUCHDOWN! Jets 7-0 Falcons 13:58, 2nd quarter New York strike first. Breece Hall punches it in a two-yard trot. That score was set up by some magic on special teams. A muffed punt from Atlanta recovered by Qwan’tez Stiggers who almost scored himself. Top work. The Panthers pick off Stafford again only this time they get a touchdown to boot. The throw is too short and Mike Johnson sneaks in and pinches it. He runs it back 50 yards and the lead. Carolina picking up from where they left off against the 49ers. Three picks on Brock Purdy led to little in that loss but they are making them pay now. PICK! Panthers 7-7 Rams 3:11, 1st quarter Might have put the mockers on Stafford with the MVP chat. He is picked off in the end zone for his first interception since week 3. Nick Scott makes the play on a wobbler for the easiest of picks. TOUCHDOWN! Titans 3-7 Jaguars 1:04, 1st quarter Told you Meyers was doing well. He catches a three-yard pass to give Jacksonville the lead. Titans 3-0 Jaguars 3:51, 1st quarter The Jags are knocking on the door. Jakobi Meyers catches one in the centre of the field then runs it up near the goalline. The receiver has been a great pickup. Really elevated Jacksonville’s offense. Panthers 7-7 Rams 6:11, 1st quarter The Rams are quickly back into the red zone. Davante Adams hooks up with Stafford again with a darting run across the field for a 32-yard pickup, TOUCHDOWN! Browns 0-7 49ers 8:51, 1st quarter Christian McCaffrey’s fine scoring season continues with a goal line run. That is his 13th touchdown of the year. TOUCHDOWN! Panthers 7-7 Rams 7:51, 1st quarter Carolina hit back immediately with a home run from Chuba Hubbard. The running back catches a short pass out to the right and he just speeds through LA’s defense. They stacked the box there and were punished. Excellent play call. It’s GOOD! Titans 3-0 Jaguars 5:06, 1st quarter Cam Ward’s day is going well so far too. He has moved the Titans into the red zone. And is unlucky not to have a touchdown. Gunnar Helm catches a beautifully thrown deep pass but is pushed out of bounds. Tennessee settle for a 28-yard boot from Joey Slye. TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 7-0 Saints 10:42, 1st quarter Devon Achane gets Miami off to a flier. He bursts free for a 29-yard scorching touchdown. New Orleans had no chance once he got into space. Matt Stafford cashes in the generous field position to who else than his new favourite target Davante Adams. Poor Kyren Williams can’t get a look in on the goalline. Automatic touchdown. The MVP is looking locked in for Stafford. Buccaneers 0-0 Cardinals 10:42, 1st quarter Baker Mayfield has is left arm in a large sleeve looking like he has been hitting the gym rather lop-sidedly. The shoulder injury on his non-throwing arm doesn’t appear to be affecting him though. He moves the Bucs to midfield with a short pass to rookie Emeka Egbuka. Panthers 0-0 Rams 14:31, 1st quarter And we’re off! Excellent start for the Rams after a brilliant kick-off return and a personal foul against the Panthers. They start from Carolina’s 40-yard line. Unwise to give this offense such an early leg up. In more Da Bears news have a dive before kick-off into Andrew Lawrence’s fine piece about the ‘85 title greats. One defense shining like those legends lives in Houston. They will be very excited about lining up against Daniel Jones today. The quarterback has a mysterious fractured leg but is good to go apparently. Could be choppy for Indy if Houston get after him. CJ Stroud returns at quarterback for the Texans too. Hello, football fans! What a treat week 13 has been already. Chicago being a Super Bowl contender certainly wasn’t on my bingo card but football is like a box of chocolates. Delicious. The action continues with a selection of seven games at 12pm CST/1pm EST/6pm GMT (home teams listed first): (6-6) Carolina Panthers v Los Angeles Rams (9-2) (3-8) Cleveland Browns v San Francisco 49ers (8-4) (8-3) Indianapolis Colts v Houston Texans (6-5) (4-7) Miami Dolphins v New Orleans Saints (2-9) (2-9) New York Jets v Atlanta Falcons (4-7) (6-5) Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Arizona Cardinals (3-8) (1-10) Tennessee Titans v Jacksonville Jaguars (7-4) The upsets came thick and fast through Thanksgiving and Black Friday so what are the chances we have a few more shocks? Let’s take a walk with the Tennessee Titans. They played Seattle close last week. A garbage time score gilded the lily somewhat but rookie quarterback Cam Ward had the best came of his young career. So today just may be that little bit better. The Ward breakout game is coming. Jacksonville have to avoid complacency or they risk coming a cropper to that fiendish old devil: the curse of S’posed to*. The Jags will be expecting to beat the Titans relatively easily. Yet there is a decent amount of pressure with Kansas City losing to Dallas on Thursday as a win keeps their postseason destiny firmly in their control. One game at a time and all that but if Tennessee can burst out of the traps all bets could be off. Let’s see shall we. (*credit: Dave Dameshek)"
